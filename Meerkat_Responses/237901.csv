   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Differential diagnosis includes hypomagnesium,
   hypothermia, hyperkalemia, hypovolemia, and hypoxia. Other etiologies
   tamponade, toxins, thrombosis, tension pneumo, sepsis, severe CHF.  In
   her, patient had hyperkalemia in the context of hemolysized specimen.
   Patient had normal magnesium, was not hypothermic and was not
   initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting of PEA arrest rather than
   because of low oxygenation.  Patient without tamponade physiology. Most
   likely etiology thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other
   possibilities is acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs.
   multifocal pneumonia on chest x-ray. Would consider PE also on the
   differential but less likely given positive enzymes. The patient
   presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea and became bradycardic
   followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with epi/atropine X2.
   Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate. No clear acidosis prior to
   arrest on labs, glucose 129. The patient was found to have CK elevated
   to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was
   found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm
   Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, Artic Sun protocol was deferred
   - f/u echo
   - trend cardiac enzymes, consider going back to cath lab today
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
   - Vanc/Zosyn for now, got ID approval
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   -          cont CVVH for now
   -          consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   -          Repeat TTE today to further evaluate systolic function and
   evidence of diastolic dysfunction
   -          Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now
   .
   #. FEN
 NPO until after cath, will start tube feeds afterwards
   .
   #. Access: R PA catheter, attempt a-line today if tolerated
   .
   #. PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC
   .
   #. Code:  FULL
   .
   #. Dispo:  Pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). The initial assessment revealed hyperkalemia and the presence of a stenotic right coronary artery (RCA). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, which improved hemodynamics.

The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) on mechanical ventilation and receiving dopamine for pressure support. Due to poor arterial access, an arterial line has not been placed, and consideration is being given to placing a femoral arterial line with the consultation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3213**] in the morning.

The patient's allergies include sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, erythromycin base, atorvastatin, promethazine HCl, colchicine, nickel, iodine, quinine, ciprofloxacin HCl, gabapentin, and aspirin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 to 137/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Differential diagnosis includes hypomagnesium,
   hypothermia, hyperkalemia, hypovolemia, and hypoxia. Other etiologies
   tamponade, toxins, thrombosis, tension pneumo, sepsis, severe CHF.  In
   her, patient had hyperkalemia in the context of hemolysized specimen.
   Patient had normal magnesium, was not hypothermic and was not
   initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting of PEA arrest rather than
   because of low oxygenation.  Patient without tamponade physiology. Most
   likely etiology thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other
   possibilities is acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs.
   multifocal pneumonia on chest x-ray. Would consider PE also on the
   differential but less likely given positive enzymes. The patient
   presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea and became bradycardic
   followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with epi/atropine X2.
   Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate. No clear acidosis prior to
   arrest on labs, glucose 129. The patient was found to have CK elevated
   to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was
   found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm
   Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, Artic Sun protocol was deferred
   - f/u echo
   - trend cardiac enzymes, consider going back to cath lab today
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
   - Vanc/Zosyn for now, got ID approval
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   -          cont CVVH for now
   -          consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   -          Repeat TTE today to further evaluate systolic function and
   evidence of diastolic dysfunction
   -          Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now
   .
   #. FEN
 NPO until after cath, will start tube feeds afterwards
   .
   #. Access: R PA catheter, attempt a-line today if tolerated
   .
   #. PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with improvement in hemodynamics. She was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially on HD, then on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.41, PaCO2 44 mmHg, SaO2 68%, and base excess -2 mEq/L.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 17.7 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) of 38%, platelet count of 280 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr"

   Assessment and Plan
   The pt. is an 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now
   admitted after witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic
   RCA. PCWP was 45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with
   PCI. Transferd to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due
   to hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest - the patient presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea
   and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with
   epi/atropine X2. Unclear precipitant for arrest. She had K recorded at
   7.6 (hemolyzed) repeat 5.9. Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate.
   No clear acidosis prior to arrest on labs, glucose 129. Pt with few
   risk factors for PE so this is less likely than acute cardiac ischemic
   event. The patient was found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7
   and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly
   elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics
   improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, Artic Sun protocol was deferred
   - Repeat TTE in am
   - Trend CEs for now
   - Wean sedation for neurological assessment
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH tonight for hyperkalemia and volume overload

   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates - will cover with
   Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - obtain sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath, continue to monitor lytes and
   fluid status
   - Unable to tolerated standard HD due to hypotension, so on CVVH for
   now
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Will repeat TTE in am to further evaluate
   systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Hold
   metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Pt was not initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting
   of PEA arrest rather than because of low oxygenation.  Likely etiology
   thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other possibilities is
   acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs. multifocal
   pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient presented with complaints of N/V,
   diarrhea and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. The patient was
   found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In
   cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg
   Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting.
   However, persistently requiring pressors. Pt now s/p RCA PCI on CVVH.
   - Given limited improvement thus far, worsened EF, and continued
   pressor requirement, pt to go to cath lab again this am for treatment
   of LAD
   Running negative with pulm pressures improving but increased dopamine
   requirement. Mix of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. Loweing pulm
   pressures with diuresis but increased dopamine. Goal today even.
   Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now. Goal improve contractility
   by addressing LAD stenosis.
   - Consider reversal of non-functioning AV fistula during this stay to
   improve cardiac output
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Wean dopa as tolerated to maintain  MAPs>60
   - ECHO showed decreased EF to 40% from previous 70%
   - Can stop trending CE, CKs peaked at 852 on [**2-15**] am, Trop peaked at
   4.7 [**2-14**] pm
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   - Blood cx x 2 pending from HD line, blood cx x 2 from R groin lines,
   Urine cx pending
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, FIO2 weaned to 40%,
   PEEP 5, consider pressure support trial following cath today
   - goal even today, wean sedation
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40%. Continues to be afebrile.
   - Continue to wean off vent as tolerated
   - Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - WBC now downtrending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   -          cont CVVH for now
   -          consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   -          Pt received re-dosing of Vanc 1g IV x 1 for trough of 7.3
   yesterday
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   -          Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   -          ECHO showed worsened EF on repeat (40% from 70% )
   -          Consider repeat after cath, and as pt is weaned off pressors
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypothyroidism. She presented with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and became bradycardic followed by pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest rather than due to low oxygenation. The likely etiology of the arrest is thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia. Other possibilities include acute sepsis, aspiration, or multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, Troponin) and markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) to 45mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 46 mmHg. Hemodynamics improved with right coronary artery (RCA) stenting. However, she continues to require pressors and has worsened left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 70% to 40%. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension. She is also being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, aspirin, and Plavix.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Pt was not initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting
   of PEA arrest rather than because of low oxygenation.  Likely etiology
   thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other possibilities is
   acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs. multifocal
   pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient presented with complaints of N/V,
   diarrhea and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. The patient was
   found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In
   cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg
   Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting.
   However, persistently requiring pressors. Pt now s/p RCA PCI on CVVH.
   - Given limited improvement thus far, worsened EF, and continued
   pressor requirement, pt to go to cath lab again this am for treatment
   of LAD
   - Consider reversal of non-functioning AV fistula during this stay to
   improve cardiac output
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Wean dopa as tolerated to maintain  MAPs>60
   - ECHO showed decreased EF to 40% from previous 70%
   - Can stop trending CE, CKs peaked at 852 on [**2-15**] am, Trop peaked at
   4.7 [**2-14**] pm
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   - Blood cx x 2 pending from HD line, blood cx x 2 from R groin lines,
   Urine cx pending
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40%. Continues to be afebrile.
   - Continue to wean off vent as tolerated
   - Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - WBC now downtrending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   -          cont CVVH for now
   -          consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   -          Pt received re-dosing of Vanc 1g IV x 1 for trough of 7.3
   yesterday
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   -          Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   -          ECHO showed worsened EF on repeat (40% from 70% )
   -          Consider repeat after cath, and as pt is weaned off pressors
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed. Hemodynamics improved following the PCI. The patient was initially on high-dose dopamine (Dopamine 12) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPs) in the 60s. She required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and multifocal pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bradycardia followed by PEA arrest. Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, troponin) indicate myocardial damage, suggesting cardiac ischemia as the likely etiology.
2. Acute Sepsis: The patient's presentation could also be consistent with acute sepsis, considering the symptoms of N/V, diarrhea, and the possibility of aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia on chest x-ray.
3. Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrate: The CT scan on admission demonstrated diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Echo shows worsening: mild to moderate regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the anterior septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and apical
   walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %,
   previously 55%). There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2).
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-12**], regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive with lower
   global ejection fraction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization revealed stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), which was stented, leading to improved hemodynamics. The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially and later switched to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.

The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bradycardia followed by PEA arrest. An elevated cardiac troponin level was found, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Other possible etiologies include acute sepsis, aspiration, or multifocal pneumonia seen on the chest x-ray. The patient underwent RCA percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with marked improvement in hemodynamics but continues to require pressors.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PEA arrest: The patient's initial intubation was not due to low oxygenation but likely secondary to cardiac ischemia. Given limited improvement thus far, worsened ejection fraction (EF), and continued pressor requirement, the patient will go to the cath lab again this morning for treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Pt was not initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting
   of PEA arrest rather than because of low oxygenation.  Likely etiology
   thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other possibilities is
   acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs. multifocal
   pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient presented with complaints of N/V,
   diarrhea and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. The patient was
   found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In
   cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg
   Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting.
   However, persistently requiring pressors. Pt now s/p RCA PCI on CVVH.
   - Given limited improvement thus far, worsened EF, and continued
   pressor requirement, pt to go to cath lab again this am for treatment
   of LAD
   Running negative with pulm pressures improving but increased dopamine
   requirement. Mix of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. Loweing pulm
   pressures with diuresis but increased dopamine. Goal today even.
   Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now. Goal improve contractility
   by addressing LAD stenosis.
   - Consider reversal of non-functioning AV fistula during this stay to
   improve cardiac output
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Wean dopa as tolerated to maintain  MAPs>60
   - ECHO showed decreased EF to 40% from previous 70%
   - Can stop trending CE, CKs peaked at 852 on [**2-15**] am, Trop peaked at
   4.7 [**2-14**] pm

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and became bradycardic followed by pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. In the cath lab, she was found to have markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting, but she required ongoing pressors. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's worsening ejection fraction (EF) and continued pressor requirement suggest cardiogenic shock. She is planned for another cardiac catheterization to address left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis.
2. Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrate: The patient has evidence of multifocal pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray. Her hypoxia is improving, and she is being weaned off ventilatory support.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She is now improving and being weaned off FiO2.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Differential diagnosis includes hypomagnesium,
   hypothermia, hyperkalemia, hypovolemia, and hypoxia. Other etiologies
   tamponade, toxins, thrombosis, tension pneumo, sepsis, severe CHF.  In
   her, patient had hyperkalemia in the context of hemolysized specimen.
   Patient had normal magnesium, was not hypothermic and was not
   initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting of PEA arrest rather than
   because of low oxygenation.  Patient without tamponade physiology. Most
   likely etiology thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other
   possibilities is acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs.
   multifocal pneumonia on chest x-ray. Would consider PE also on the
   differential but less likely given positive enzymes. The patient
   presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea and became bradycardic
   followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with epi/atropine X2.
   Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate. No clear acidosis prior to
   arrest on labs, glucose 129. The patient was found to have CK elevated
   to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was
   found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm
   Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, Artic Sun protocol was deferred
   - f/u echo
   - trend cardiac enzymes, consider going back to cath lab today
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
   - Vanc/Zosyn for now, got ID approval
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   -          cont CVVH for now
   -          consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   -          Repeat TTE today to further evaluate systolic function and
   evidence of diastolic dysfunction
   -          Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, which improved hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and then switched to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to hypotension.

The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% (previously 55%) with moderate aortic valve stenosis. She has evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29.4 mg/dL and a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. There are also elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and troponin-T), indicating myocardial injury. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hyperkalemia (K+ of 5.6 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (Na+ of 135 mEq/L).

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, as shown by a chest X-ray and a CT scan demonstrating bilateral pulmonary infiltr"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. Cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), which was stented and resulted in improved hemodynamics. The patient was initially on hemodialysis (HD) but due to hypotension, she was switched to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient presented with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bradycardia, followed by PEA arrest. She regained rhythm with epinephrine and atropine. Hyperkalemia was treated with calcium exchange resin (Kayexelate). There were no clear signs of acidosis prior to the arrest. Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK: 452, MB fraction: 9.7, Troponin: 3.74) were found, indicating possible myocardial injury. In the cath lab, the patient had a markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 45 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 46 mmHg. Hemodynamics improved after RCA stenting.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Pt was not initially  hypoxic, intubated in the setting
   of PEA arrest rather than because of low oxygenation.  Likely etiology
   thought to be secondary to cardiac ischemia.  Other possibilities is
   acute sepsis, there is possibility of aspiration vs. multifocal
   pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient presented with complaints of N/V,
   diarrhea and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. The patient was
   found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. In
   cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated PCWP to 45mmg
   Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with RCA stenting.
   However, persistently requiring pressors. Pt now s/p RCA PCI on CVVH.
   - Given limited improvement thus far, worsened EF, and continued
   pressor requirement, pt to go to cath lab again this am for treatment
   of LAD
   Running negative with pulm pressures improving but increased dopamine
   requirement. Mix of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. Loweing pulm
   pressures with diuresis but increased dopamine. Goal today even.
   Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now. Goal improve contractility
   by addressing LAD stenosis.
   - Consider reversal of non-functioning AV fistula during this stay to
   improve cardiac output
   - Continue ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Wean dopa as tolerated to maintain  MAPs>60
   - ECHO showed decreased EF to 40% from previous 70%
   - Can stop trending CE, CKs peaked at 852 on [**2-15**] am, Trop peaked at
   4.7 [**2-14**] pm
   - Monitor lytes, CVVH for volume overload
   - Blood cx x 2 pending from HD line, blood cx x 2 from R groin lines,
   Urine cx pending
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, FIO2 weaned to 40%,
   PEEP 5, consider pressure support trial following cath today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A catheterization showed stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), which was stented and resulted in improved hemodynamics. The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially and then on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.

The patient presented with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bradycardia before the PEA arrest. She had elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, troponin), and the ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 70% to 40%. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for RCA stenting, but her condition has not improved significantly, and she continues to require pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening EF and continued pressor requirement.
2. Vasodilatory shock due to low pulmonary pressures.
3. Respiratory failure due to multifocal pulmonary infiltrate and hypoxia.
4. Volume overload due to CVVH.
5. Infection"

   24 Hour Events:
   - vanc level overnight 14.5, so dose of vancomycin given
   - patient started on pressure support trial yesterday afternoon
   - restarting tube feeds tonight, will hold in AM for possible
   extubation
   - patient being weaned of fentayl/versed today
   - patient underwent cardiac catherization with placement of 2 stents
   to: 1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD stenosis with a
   2.5x23mm and a 2.25x12mm Mini Vision stents that was postdilated to 2.5
   proximally. The diag was rescued and dilated with a 2.0x8mm Voyager
   balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent,
   no angiograpically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   2. Successful direct stenting of the proximal LAD stenosis with a
   3.0x8mm Vision stent. Final angiography revealed no resdiualstenosis,
   no angioraphically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD stenoses
   - [**2-15**] abdominal x-ray - IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
   [**2-16**] chest x-ray - FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been
   obtained with patient in supine position, and analysis is conducted in
   direct comparison with a preceding similar examination dated [**2-15**], [**2144**]. There is further clearance of the previously described
   diffuse increased small patchy confluenting pattern predominantly in
   the right lung which in combination with patient's history most likely
   represented pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal
   infiltrates are identified. Previously described position of ETT, NG
   tube, double-lumen dialysis catheter, and pulmonary catheter approached
   from below remain all in unchanged appropriate position. No
   pneumothorax has developed.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely secondary to acute ischemia given elevated
   troponins, CK-MBs on admission prior to code blue with CK elevated to
   452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. Of note, patient was not initially
   hypoxic,  and patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest.
   Other possibilities for etiology which are less likely are acute sepsis
   - ?aspiration vs. multifocal pneumonia. In addition, metabolic
   derrangements including hyperkalemia may have contributed as patient
   noted to have elevated potassium on admission however was hemolyzed
   specimen. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated
   PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with
   RCA PCI. However, persistently requiring pressors. Patient returned to
   cath lab for LAD stenting yesterday.
   .
   # Shock
 suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic shock. Patient on
   broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn although low clinical
   suspicion for pneumonia. Patient s/p 2 cardiac catherizations, with 2
   stents to LAD and RCA PCI with goal to hopefully improve hemodynamics.
   Patient with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on cardiac
   catherization.
   -          cont management for acute ischemia: aspirin, statin, plavix,
   hold beta blocker given pressor requirement
   -          cont dopamine as required to maintain MAPs > 60, wean as
   tolerated
   -          cont broad spectrum antibiotics
   -          cont CVVH for now until pressure stabilized
   -          consider closing of non-functioning AV fistula
   -          f/u cultures including daily sputum cultures while intubated
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation. Last gas from
   this morning was excellent.
   - turn off sedation, trial of extubation today
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support.
   Continues to be afebrile. Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - trial of extubation today as above
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics for now with Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   - cont CVVH for now, consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   -  Pt received re-dosing of Vanc 1g IV x 1 for trough of 14.5
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Repeat echo on admission demonstrates mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
   anterior walls, distal inferior and apical walls. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). There is moderate aortic
   valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-12**], regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive with lower
   global ejection fraction. Though the aortic valve gradient is lower,
   the severity of aortic stenosis likely similar.
   - Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   - Echo as above demonstrates more extensive with lower global ejection
   fraction than previous which may be in the setting of periischemic
   - Consider repeat echo after patient weaned off of pressors
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now given blood pressure issues as above

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely secondary to acute ischemia given elevated
   troponins, CK-MBs on admission prior to code blue with CK elevated to
   452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. Of note, patient was not initially
   hypoxic,  and patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest.
   Other possibilities for etiology which are less likely are acute sepsis
   - ?aspiration vs. multifocal pneumonia. In addition, metabolic
   derrangements including hyperkalemia may have contributed as patient
   noted to have elevated potassium on admission however was hemolyzed
   specimen. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated
   PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with
   RCA PCI. However, persistently requiring pressors. Patient returned to
   cath lab for LAD stenting yesterday.
   .
   # Shock
 suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic shock. Patient on
   broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn although low clinical
   suspicion for pneumonia. Patient s/p 2 cardiac catherizations, with 2
   stents to LAD and RCA PCI with goal to hopefully improve hemodynamics.
   Patient with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on cardiac
   catherization.
   -          cont management for acute ischemia: aspirin, statin, plavix,
   hold beta blocker given pressor requirement
   -          cont dopamine as required to maintain MAPs > 60, wean as
   tolerated
   -          cont broad spectrum antibiotics
   -          cont CVVH for now until pressure stabilized
   -          consider closing of non-functioning AV fistula
   -          f/u cultures including daily sputum cultures while intubated
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation. Last gas from
   this morning was excellent.
   - turn off sedation, trial of extubation today
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support.
   Continues to be afebrile. Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - trial of extubation today as above
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics for now with Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.
   - cont CVVH for now, consider changing back to HD when tolerated
   -  Pt received re-dosing of Vanc 1g IV x 1 for trough of 14.5
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Repeat echo on admission demonstrates mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
   anterior walls, distal inferior and apical walls. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). There is moderate aortic
   valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-12**], regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive with lower
   global ejection fraction. Though the aortic valve gradient is lower,
   the severity of aortic stenosis likely similar.
   - Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   - Echo as above demonstrates more extensive with lower global ejection
   fraction than previous which may be in the setting of periischemic
   - Consider repeat echo after patient weaned off of pressors
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now given blood pressure issues as above
   .
   #. FEN
 tube feeds given overnight, held this morning for possible
   extubation
   .
   #. Access: R triple lumen, A-line, tunneled HD catheter in R subclav

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic hypertension. The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). Cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with improvement in hemodynamics. The patient then underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to PEA arrest and is now on pressure support with weaning sedation. Last gas from this morning was excellent.

2. Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrate: A CT scan on admission demonstrated diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration. Hypoxia is improving on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and FiO2 was weaned to 40%. Sputum cultures grew only yeast.

3. ESRD on CVVH: The patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath but was unable to tolerate standard HD due to hypotension, so they were changed to CVVH.

4. Chronic Diast"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - vanc level overnight 14.5, so dose of vancomycin given
   - patient started on pressure support trial yesterday afternoon
   - restarting tube feeds tonight, will hold in AM for possible
   extubation
   - patient being weaned of fentayl/versed today
   - patient underwent cardiac catherization with placement of 2 stents
   to: 1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD stenosis with a
   2.5x23mm and a 2.25x12mm Mini Vision stents that was postdilated to 2.5
   proximally. The diag was rescued and dilated with a 2.0x8mm Voyager
   balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent,
   no angiograpically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   2. Successful direct stenting of the proximal LAD stenosis with a
   3.0x8mm Vision stent. Final angiography revealed no resdiualstenosis,
   no angioraphically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD stenoses
   - [**2-15**] abdominal x-ray - IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
   [**2-16**] chest x-ray - FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been
   obtained with patient in supine position, and analysis is conducted in
   direct comparison with a preceding similar examination dated [**2-15**], [**2144**]. There is further clearance of the previously described
   diffuse increased small patchy confluenting pattern predominantly in
   the right lung which in combination with patient's history most likely
   represented pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal
   infiltrates are identified. Previously described position of ETT, NG
   tube, double-lumen dialysis catheter, and pulmonary catheter approached
   from below remain all in unchanged appropriate position. No
   pneumothorax has developed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple comorbidities. The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization revealed stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, requiring the initiation of dopamine and subsequent conversion to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to intolerance of standard HD. Other issues include hypoxic respiratory failure, multifocal pulmonary infiltrate, urinary tract infection (UTI), and anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 94/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving pressure support ventilation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and tropon"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - vanc level overnight 14.5, so dose of vancomycin given
   - patient started on pressure support trial yesterday afternoon
   - restarting tube feeds tonight, will hold in AM for possible
   extubation
   - patient being weaned of fentayl/versed today
   - patient underwent cardiac catherization with placement of 2 stents
   to: 1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD stenosis with a
   2.5x23mm and a 2.25x12mm Mini Vision stents that was postdilated to 2.5
   proximally. The diag was rescued and dilated with a 2.0x8mm Voyager
   balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent,
   no angiograpically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   2. Successful direct stenting of the proximal LAD stenosis with a
   3.0x8mm Vision stent. Final angiography revealed no resdiualstenosis,
   no angioraphically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA
   comments).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD stenoses
   - [**2-15**] abdominal x-ray - IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
   [**2-16**] chest x-ray - FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been
   obtained with patient in supine position, and analysis is conducted in
   direct comparison with a preceding similar examination dated [**2-15**], [**2144**]. There is further clearance of the previously described
   diffuse increased small patchy confluenting pattern predominantly in
   the right lung which in combination with patient's history most likely
   represented pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal
   infiltrates are identified. Previously described position of ETT, NG
   tube, double-lumen dialysis catheter, and pulmonary catheter approached
   from below remain all in unchanged appropriate position. No
   pneumothorax has developed.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**].
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely secondary to acute ischemia given elevated
   troponins, CK-MBs on admission prior to code blue with CK elevated to
   452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. Of note, patient was not initially
   hypoxic,  and patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest.
   Other possibilities for etiology which are less likely are acute sepsis
   - ?aspiration vs. multifocal pneumonia. In addition, metabolic
   derrangements including hyperkalemia may have contributed as patient
   noted to have elevated potassium on admission however was hemolyzed
   specimen. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated
   PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with
   RCA PCI. However, she continued to persistently requiring pressors.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent admission after witnessing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient's condition improved with RCA PCI but continued to require pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute ischemia, shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, multifocal pulmonary infiltrate, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic diastolic CHF, hypertension, anemia, hypothyroidism, orthostatic hypotension, and fecal incontinence. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, CVVH for ESRD, and other medications as per the assessment and plan section.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Ischemia: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which was likely secondary to acute ischemia. Elevated troponins and CK-MBs on admission indicate ongoing myocardial injury. The patient underwent PCI, but ongoing ischemia may still be a concern.
2. Shock: The patient is suspected to have a mixture of cardiogenic and septic shock. Persistent requirement of pressors suggests ongoing hemodynamic instability.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been improving on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and pressure support trial, but mental status remains a barrier for extubation.
4. Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrate: The patient has a history of diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration seen on CT scan. Yeast is growing in sputum cultures, indicating a possible fungal infection.
5. UTI: The patient has a GNR infection in the urine culture, which needs further follow-up and sensitivity testing.
6. ESRD on CVVH: The patient was unable to tolerate standard HD due to hypotension and required urgent dialysis. CVVH was initiated, but the patient continues to require it, along with plans to change back to HD when tolerated.
7. Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate aortic valve stenosis. There is also evidence of moderate mitral regurgitation.
8. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol, and nifedipine is being held due to hypotensive episodes.
9. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped, and transfusion of 1U PRBC is planned. Epoetin alfa is also being continued.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on synthroid, and TSH levels should be monitored.
11. Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient is on midodrine as an outpatient but will be held for now due to blood pressure issues.
12. Fecal Incontinence: The patient has a history of fecal incontinence, and tube feeds have been given overnight, with plans to hold them in the morning for possible extubation.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Weaned and DCed all sedatives and pressors
   - Pt autoregulating BP with pressures around 120/50
   - Pt remains comatose with poor response to pain (opens eyes, does not
   localize)
   - Holding off on Epo for now as is thrombogenic in the setting of acute
   MI with new stents in place. Will transfuse as needed.
   - Renal asks that we NOT close the L A-V fistula for now as
   hemodynamically stable
   - Restarted tube feeds as no going to be extubated this PM
   - Received 1U pRBC with appropriate increase in H/H from /23 to /25
   - Anemia studies sent, showed elevated ferritin consistent with anemia
   of inflammation and WNL serum iron level.
   - DCed nephrocaps and repleted Pi
   - DCed vancomycin as no sign of line infection. Continued pip/tazo for
   positive UA
   - Pulled Aline on the R for cold hand. Pulses doplarable distal and
   proximal afterwards
   - Clotted off CVVH filter around 4am on [**2-18**]. Held off on restarting
   CVVH as BPs are excellent and may be able to tolerate HD. Will discuss
   with renal in the AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Pt remains comatose.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. Cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), which was stented. The patient's hemodynamics improved with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and he was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU). Since then, the patient has undergone repeat cardiac catheterization with the placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's condition has progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. However, the patient remains comatose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's ongoing coma may be due to anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest.
2. Multifocal Pulmonary Infiltrate: The patient has a diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration, which could indicate a respiratory infection or pneumonia. There is also yeast growth in the sputum cultures.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a GNR infection in the urine culture, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued.
4. Chronic Diastolic CHF:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially on HD, followed by continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to hypotension. 

Since admission, the patient has undergone repeat cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. However, the patient remains comatose.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Fever: The patient had a temperature spike this morning, indicating a potential infection. Blood cultures should be resent, and femoral lines should be removed or changed. The possibility of changing the HD line for one with an access port should be discussed with renal and interventional radiology (IR).

2. PEA arrest: The patient had a witnessed PEA arrest, likely due to coronary artery disease (CAD)/ischemia. The patient underwent re"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Pt remains comatose.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely secondary to acute ischemia given elevated
   troponins, CK-MBs on admission prior to code blue with CK elevated to
   452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. Of note, patient was not initially
   hypoxic,  and patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest.
   Other possibilities for etiology which are less likely are acute sepsis
   - ?aspiration vs. multifocal pneumonia. In addition, metabolic
   derrangements including hyperkalemia may have contributed as patient
   noted to have elevated potassium on admission however was hemolyzed
   specimen. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated
   PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with
   RCA PCI. However, she continued to persistently requiring pressors.
   Patient returned to cath lab for LAD stenting. Since then he has had
   progressive improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory status. She
   remains comatose
   - Continue management for acute ischemia: aspirin, statin, plavix, hold
   beta blocker given pressor requirement
   - Monitor on tele
   - Manage ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and
   coma as below
   .
   #. ESRD on HD/CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.  Pressures
   have improved and now off pressors entirely.
   - Clotted CVVH filter overnight. As pressures stable, held off on
   restarting CVVH and will discuss HD with renal
   - d/c nephrocaps and repleted  per renal
   - hold off on EPO given recent coronary artery intervention
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation. Last gas from
   this morning was excellent.  Barrier is currently mental status
   patient with h/o CVAs.
   -          Off sedation, on pressure support however making low tidal
   volumes and tachypneic to high 30s with still thick secretions
   -          This morning does not respond to commands which will be
   barrier to extubation
   .
   # Coma: Pt with ongoing coma in spite of being off sedation and with
   good BP and uremic control
   - Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA
   arrest
   - Consider head CT for ? anoxic brain injury today
   - consider neuro consult if clinical status does not improve
   .
   # Shock
 now resolved. suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic
   shock. Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn although
   low clinical suspicion for pneumonia, likely aspiration in setting of
   arrest. Patient s/p 2 cardiac catherizations, with 2 stents to LAD and
   RCA PCI with goal to hopefully improve hemodynamics. Patient with
   elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on cardiac catherization.
   Patient now off all pressors and off CVVH.
   - cont pip/tazo
   - Off CVVH due to filter clotting. As shock resolved, can now have HD
   if renal agrees
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support.
   Continues to be afebrile. Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - consider trial of extubation, however may defer
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics for now with Vanc/Zosyn for now .
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine culture
   - f/u culture, await sensitivities
   - Continue on Zosyn.
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Repeat echo on admission demonstrates mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
   anterior walls, distal inferior and apical walls. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). There is moderate aortic
   valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-12**], regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive with lower
   global ejection fraction. Though the aortic valve gradient is lower,
   the severity of aortic stenosis likely similar.
   - Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP, consider
   restarting as blood pressure stabilitzes
   - Echo as above demonstrates more extensive with lower global ejection
   fraction than previous which may be in the setting of periischemic
   - Consider repeat echo today as off all pressors
   - Will likely need diuresis post extubation if BP tolerates.
   .
   #. Hypertension
 patient currently normotensive, previously was
   hypotensive with shock so was holding outpatient regimen of losartan,
   metoprolol, nifedipine
   - consider restarting medications one at a time when BP stable
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct drop.  No obvious hematomas s/p cath.
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC today.  Follow post transfusion hct.
   - Continue epo
   - Guaiac all stools (none recently)
   - If no bump in hct consider abd/pelvis CT scan to rule out bleed.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now given blood pressure issues as above
   .
   #. FEN
 tube feeds given overnight, held this morning for possible
   extubation.
   .
   #. Access: R triple lumen, A-line (not [**Location (un) 103**] well currently
   consider exchanging), tunneled HD catheter in R subclav

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, placing two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and RCA. The patient's hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. However, the patient remains comatose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's ongoing coma could be due to anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest.
2. Multifocal pulmonary infiltrate: The patient has a diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration. This may indicate pneumonia or aspiration.
3. UTI: The patient has a GNR infection in his urine culture, indicating a possible urinary tract infection.
4. Chronic diastolic CHF: The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
5. Hypertension: The patient was previously hypotensive with shock, so it is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Weaned and DCed all sedatives and pressors
   - Pt autoregulating BP with pressures around 120/50
   - Pt remains comatose with poor response to pain (opens eyes, does not
   localize)
   - Holding off on Epo for now as is thrombogenic in the setting of acute
   MI with new stents in place. Will transfuse as needed.
   - Renal asks that we NOT close the L A-V fistula for now as
   hemodynamically stable
   - Restarted tube feeds as no going to be extubated this PM
   - Received 1U pRBC with appropriate increase in H/H from /23 to /25
   - Anemia studies sent, showed elevated ferritin consistent with anemia
   of inflammation and WNL serum iron level.
   - DCed nephrocaps and repleted Pi
   - DCed vancomycin as no sign of line infection. Continued pip/tazo for
   positive UA
   - Pulled Aline on the R for cold hand. Pulses doplarable distal and
   proximal afterwards
   - Clotted off CVVH filter around 4am on [**2-18**]. Held off on restarting
   CVVH as BPs are excellent and may be able to tolerate HD. Will discuss
   with renal in the AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Pt remains comatose.
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely secondary to acute ischemia given elevated
   troponins, CK-MBs on admission prior to code blue with CK elevated to
   452 with MBI 9.7 and troponin 3.74. Of note, patient was not initially
   hypoxic,  and patient was intubated in the setting of PEA arrest.
   Other possibilities for etiology which are less likely are acute sepsis
   - ?aspiration vs. multifocal pneumonia. In addition, metabolic
   derrangements including hyperkalemia may have contributed as patient
   noted to have elevated potassium on admission however was hemolyzed
   specimen. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly elevated
   PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics improved with
   RCA PCI. However, she continued to persistently requiring pressors.
   Patient returned to cath lab for LAD stenting. Since then he has had
   progressive improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory status. She
   remains comatose
   - Continue management for acute ischemia: aspirin, statin, plavix, hold
   beta blocker given pressor requirement
   - Monitor on tele
   - Manage ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and
   coma as below
   .
   #. ESRD on HD/CVVH - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath however patient was unable to
   tolerated standard HD due to hypotension so changed to CVVH.  Pressures
   have improved and now off pressors entirely.
   - Clotted CVVH filter overnight. As pressures stable, held off on
   restarting CVVH and will discuss HD with renal
   - d/c nephrocaps and repleted Pi per renal.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation. Last gas from
   this morning was excellent.  Barrier is currently mental status
   patient with h/o CVAs.
   - Off sedation
   - Doing well on pressure support
   - Likely extubation today, but concern for mental status
   .
   # Coma: Pt with ongoing coma in spite of being off sedation and with
   good BP and uremic control
   - Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA
   arrest
   - Consider head CT for ? anoxic brain injury today
   .
   # Shock
 suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic shock. Patient on
   broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn although low clinical
   suspicion for pneumonia, likely aspiration in setting of arrest.
   Patient s/p 2 cardiac catherizations, with 2 stents to LAD and RCA PCI
   with goal to hopefully improve hemodynamics. Patient with elevated
   pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on cardiac catherization. Treated
   with CVVH + pressors with progressive improvement. Show is now
   resolved.
   - Off dopamine now
   - cont pip/tazo
   - Off CVVH due to filter clotting. As shock resolved, can now have HD
   if renal agrees
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support.
   Continues to be afebrile. Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - trial of extubation today as above
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics for now with Vanc/Zosyn for now .
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine culture
   - f/u culture, await sensitivities
   - Continue on Zosyn.
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Repeat echo on admission demonstrates mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
   anterior walls, distal inferior and apical walls. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). There is moderate aortic
   valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-10-12**], regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive with lower
   global ejection fraction. Though the aortic valve gradient is lower,
   the severity of aortic stenosis likely similar.
   - Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   - Echo as above demonstrates more extensive with lower global ejection
   fraction than previous which may be in the setting of periischemic
   - Consider repeat echo after patient weaned off of pressors
   - Will likely need diuresis post extubation if BP tolerates.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive.
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct drop.  No obvious hematomas s/p cath.
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC today.  Follow post transfusion hct.
   - Continue epo
   - Guaiac all stools (none recently)
   - If no bump in hct consider abd/pelvis CT scan to rule out bleed.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   - check TSH
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now given blood pressure issues as above
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, which improved hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and then transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.

Since admission, the patient has undergone a repeat cardiac catheterization with the placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. The patient developed a fever and was found to have an infection in the urine culture, which was positive for Enterobacter cloacae. Antibiotics were started, and the patient is currently on Zosyn for the urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. His mental status has improved, but"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the note details various events and interventions that have occurred over the course of the day.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F (Tmax), blood pressure ranging from 155/52 mmHg to 169/60 mmHg, heart rate between 81-104 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 125.

The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for criticality and volume management. The FT4 level was within normal range at 1.2.

The patient has several allergies, including mouth sores with Bactrim, unknown reactions to sulfonamides, erythromycin base, atorvastatin, Phenergan, colchicine, nickel, iodine, quinine, ciprofloxacin, and neurontin.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 02/16/2014 at 09:18 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/19/2014 at 05:39 AM.

Infusions include lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient also has ongoing medical and family history updates.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total input of 2474 mL of fluids and output of 1509 mL, with urine output of only 40 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube on CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 192 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 11.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 117 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.7 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 28 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 138 mEq/L, and a low platelet count (Plt) at 227 K/uL.

Other lab values indicate elevated troponin-T at 3.84, TCO2 at 30, glucose levels ranging from 98-170 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated ALT and AST levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Pt remains comatose.
   .
   #Fever: Patient perstiently febrile despite removing the line
   yesterday.  Only positive cultures so far from urine culture growing
   enterobacter cloace. Patient on Zosyn for urine infection, previously
   on vanco now off.
   -          f/u cultures
   -
   # PEA arrest
 Likely CAD/Ischemia s/p revascularization.
   - Continue: aspirin, statin, plavix
   - Monitor on tele
   - Manage ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and
   coma as below
   .
   #. ESRD on HD/CVVH -
   - Clotted CVVH filter overnight. As pressures stable, held off on
   restarting CVVH and will discuss HD with renal
   - holding off on EPO given recent coronary artery intervention
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation. Last gas from
   this morning was excellent.  Barrier is currently mental status
   patient with h/o CVAs.
   -          Off sedation, on pressure support however making low tidal
   volumes and tachypneic to high 30s with still thick secretions
   -          This morning does not respond to commands which will be
   barrier to extubation
   RSBI unsatisfactory stillt his morning.
   .
   # Coma: Pt with ongoing coma in spite of being off sedation and with
   good BP and uremic control
   - Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA
   arrest
   - Consider head CT for ? anoxic brain injury today
   .
   # Shock
 now resolved. suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic
   shock.
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support..
   Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - consider trial of extubation, however may defer
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics for now with Vanc/Zosyn for now .
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine culture
   - f/u culture, await sensitivities
   - Continue on Zosyn.
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
   - Hold metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP, consider
   restarting as blood pressure stabilitzes
   - Consider repeat echo tomorrow  as off all pressors
   - Will likely need diuresis post extubation if BP tolerates.
   .
   #.  h/o Hypertension

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. Cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and then transitioned to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to hypotension. He underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. However, the patient remains comatose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been persistently febrile despite removing the femoral line yesterday. The positive urine culture growing Enterobacter cloacae suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest likely due to coronary artery disease (CAD)/ischemia, which was successfully managed with revascularization.
3. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). The clotted CVVH filter overnight needs to be"

   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with improvement in hemodynamics.

The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), coma, multifocal pulmonary infiltrate, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic diastolic CHF, anemia, hypothyroidism, orthostatic hypotension, and femoral nerve palsy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Enterobacter cloacae. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy, such as ciprofloxacin, to complete a 10-day course.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pulmonary infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia. Further evaluation with sputum cultures and chest X-rays is needed to confirm"

   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Pt remains comatose.
   .
   #Fever: resend blood cultures, discontinue/remove femoral lines and
   will discuss with renal and IR whether or not HD line [**Doctor Last Name **] be changed
   for one with an access port, or if we can use this for medications. On
   Zosyn, recently stopped vancomycin, but given no hemodynamic changes
   team will defer restarting pending postive cultures.
   # PEA arrest
 Likely CAD/Ischemia s/p revascularization.
   - Continue: aspirin, statin, plavix
   - Monitor on tele
   - Manage ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and
   coma as below
   .
   #. ESRD on HD/CVVH -
   - Clotted CVVH filter overnight. As pressures stable, held off on
   restarting CVVH and will discuss HD with renal
   - holding off on EPO given recent coronary artery intervention

   patient with h/o CVAs.
   -          Off sedation, on pressure support however making low tidal
   volumes and tachypneic to high 30s with still thick secretions
   -          This morning does not respond to commands which will be
   barrier to extubation
   RSBI unsatisfactory stillt his morning.
   .
   # Coma: Pt with ongoing coma in spite of being off sedation and with
   good BP and uremic control
   - Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA), as well as placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics improved with PCI, and the patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially and then on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to hypotension. 

The patient remains comatose and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever spiked to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and blood cultures were sent. The patient's central venous catheter tip was cultured, and Enterobacter cloacae was positive. The patient's urinary catheter also showed a GNR infection. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 155/52 mmHg to 169/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's renal function is improving, but there are concerns about ongoing"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). He is currently on pressure support ventilation and sedation, with improving mental status but still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which is being treated with Zosyn. The patient's blood pressure has improved, but there are concerns about his chronic diastolic CHF, anemia, hypothyroidism, orthostatic hypotension, and feeding intolerance. The plan is to transition him to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) and attempt extubation post-HD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which may lead to worsening infection or sepsis if not effectively managed.
3. CHF:"

   - patient got dialysis which she tolerated well without a drop in blood
   pressure
   - as dialysis was not done until late decided to give pt chance to rest
   prior to intubation (family was concerned she was tired) prior to
   extubation
   - deferred restarting tube feeds as plan for hopefully extubation
   tomorrow morning
   - renal recs - ? UF if unable to extubate secondary to volume
   - family to come in in the AM to try to be there for extubation,
   updated on events of the day
- urine culture: + enterobacter cloacae => patient can not get cipro as has alle

   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics.

The patient was initially on pressors and then transitioned to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to hypotension. Subsequently, the patient underwent another cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued.

The patient has been experiencing fever, with the fever curve trending down since the removal of the femoral line. Cultures revealed Enterobacter cloacae from a urine culture, and the patient is currently on Zosyn for the urinary infection. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's medical conditions include likely coronary artery disease/ischemia post revascularization, ESRD on HD/CVVH, hypoxic respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), coma, multifocal pulmonary infiltrate, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic diastolic CHF, anemia, hypothyroid"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2145-2-19**]
   - patient got dialysis which she tolerated well without a drop in blood
   pressure
   - as dialysis was not done until late decided to give pt chance to rest
   prior to intubation (family was concerned she was tired) prior to
   extubation
   - deferred restarting tube feeds as plan extubation Sat AM
   - renal recs - ? UF if unable to extubate secondary to volume
   - family to come in in the AM to try to be there for extubation,
   updated on events of the day
- urine culture: + enterobacter cloacae => patient can not get cipro as has alle

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. The cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with improvement in hemodynamics. The patient was initially on hemodialysis (HD) and then transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, fever, PEA arrest, ESRD on HD/CVVH, altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), cardiogenic shock (resolved), chronic diastolic CHF, anemia, hypothyroidism, orthostatic hypotension, and fecal incontinence.

The patient is planned for a trial of extubation this morning, given the history of difficult airway due to goiter, anesthesia will be on call. The urine culture is positive for enterobacter cloacae, and the patient is on zosyn for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, which improved hemodynamics. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially on HD, then on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued.

The patient is currently being treated for several conditions:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is improving after CVVH and is now on pressure support ventilation with adequate respiratory system resistance index (RSBI). A trial of extubation is planned for this morning, with anesthesia on call due to the patient's difficult airway caused by goiter.
2. Fever: The patient's fever curve is trending down since femoral line removal. The only positive cultures are from a urine culture growing Enterobacter clo"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued.
   .
   #Fever: Fever curve trending down s/p femoral line DC.  Only positive
   cultures so far from urine culture growing enterobacter cloace. Patient
   on Zosyn for urine infection, previously on vanco now off.
   - Urine cx growing enterobacter

   cipro
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # PEA arrest
 Likely CAD/Ischemia s/p revascularization.
   - Continue: aspirin, statin, plavix
   - Monitor on tele
   - Manage ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and
   coma as below
   .
   #. ESRD on HD/CVVH -
   - BP improved, plan now on HD
   - holding off on EPO given recent coronary artery intervention

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 improving s/p CVVH, now on pressure
   support trial with pressure of [**4-27**] and weaning sedation..
  plan for
   trial of extubation this morning
   - Given history of difficult airway [**1-25**] goiter, will have anaesthesia
   on call
   .
   # Coma: MS improving
   - Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA
   arrest
   - As improving, likely multifactorial related to meds and hypotension
   as well as ICU delirium
   .
   # UTI: enterbacter
   - taper abx to cipro to complete 10 day course
   .
   # Shock
 now resolved. suspect mixture of cardiogenic and septic
   shock.

   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT on admission demonstrated a
   diffuse consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   Hypoxia improving on CMV, FiO2 weaned to 40% now on pressure support..
   Sputum cultures growing only yeast.
   - extubation today
   - CXR improving, no evidence of PNA

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed. The patient's hemodynamics improved, and she was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) initially on pressors and later on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.

The patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on February 16th. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and a urine culture revealed growth of Enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to all tested antibiotics except ciprofloxacin due to an allergy. The patient is currently on Zosyn for the urinary infection.

The patient likely has coronary artery disease/ischemia post revascularization. She is being managed with aspirin, statin, and Plavix. Monitoring on telemetry, managing ESRD, respiratory failure (improving), shock (resolved), and coma"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA). She received RCA stenting and improved hemodynamics with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- The patient was initially on hemodialysis (HD) and then switched to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension.
- She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and the patient no longer requires pressors.
- The patient has a fever curve trending down since the removal of a femoral line. The only positive culture so far is from a urine culture growing Enterobacter cloacae.
- The patient is currently on Zosyn for the urine infection and previously received vancomycin, which has been discontinued.
- The patient's respiratory failure is improving, and she is now on pressure support ventilation with a trial of weaning sedation. Mental status remains a barrier for extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. Cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient then underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. The patient successfully extubated and is doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient has ESRD and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). It is important to manage his fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as monitor for any signs of infection or fluid overload.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to medication side effects, hypotension, or ICU delirium. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications may be necessary to improve his mental status.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever, and cultures revealed an infection caused by Enterobacter cloace. He is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with improvement in hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and hemodialysis (HD), then transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. The patient was successfully extubated and is doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management with hemodialysis or CVVH. It is important to monitor blood pressure and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is improving but may be related to anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest, medications, hypotension, and ICU delirium.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient then underwent another cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Her hemodynamics have progressively improved, and she has been successfully extubated.

The patient's current conditions and plans include:
1. PEA arrest - likely due to coronary artery disease (CAD)/ischemia following revascularization. Continue aspirin, statin, and Plavix. Monitor on tele.
2. ESRD on HD/CVVH - blood pressure has improved, so the plan is now on HD. Hold off on erythropoietin (EPO) due to recent coronary artery intervention.
3. Altered mental status (MS) - improving daily, with a son's report of 70% improvement. Concern for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest. As improving, likely multifactorial related to medications and hypotension as well as ICU delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed. The patient's hemodynamics improved, and she was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) initially on pressors and then on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and the patient was successfully extubated and doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is now on hemodialysis (HD). However, her recent coronary artery intervention may necessitate holding off on erythropoietin (EPO) administration.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving but remains altered. This could be related to medication effects, hypotension during the PEA arrest, or ICU delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).
- She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED).
- A cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics.
- The patient was initially on pressors and then transitioned to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to hypotension.
- She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [**2-16**].
- Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued.
- The patient was successfully extubated and is doing well.
- Current issues include ESRD on HD/CVVH, altered mental status (improving), fever with a positive urine culture growing Enterobacter cloacae, resolved hypoxic respiratory failure, resolved cardiogenic shock, chronic diastolic CHF, anemia, hypothyroidism, orthostatic hypotension, and potential feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's renal function remains a concern, and"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with hemodialysis or CVVH. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an improving altered mental status, possibly related to medications, hypotension, anoxic brain injury, or ICU delirium. Close monitoring and gradual improvement are expected.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, leading to improved hemodynamics.

The patient was initially on pressors and then switched to continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. Subsequently, the patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and the patient was successfully extubated and doing well.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently on HD/CVVH. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust the treatment as needed.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is improving. This may be related to medications, hypotension, anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest"

   Assessment and Plan
   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Now successfully extubated and doing
   well.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed. The patient's hemodynamics improved, and he was transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) initially on hemodialysis (HD), then on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension. He underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and the patient was successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management through hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting treatment as necessary is important to prevent complications related to fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is improving but may be multifactorial, including anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest, medication effects, and ICU delirium. Close monitoring and evaluation of cognitive function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions, including urinary tract infection (UTI), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is currently stable post-extubation and tolerating oral intake. However, the repeat urinalysis still appears dirty, and a pending SS evaluation and PT consult have been ordered. The patient has several known drug allergies, including sulfonamides, erythromycin base, atorvastatin, phenobarbital, colchicine, nickel, iodine, quinine, ciprofloxacin HCl, and neurontin. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/19/19 at 08:30 PM.

1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's dirty urinalysis indicates the presence of a UTI, which can lead to complications such as kidney infection, sepsis, or urosepsis if not appropriately treated.
2. Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient's history of AMI increases the risk of further cardiac events, such as unstable angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues. He has been doing well post-extubation but still has a dirty urine analysis. The patient has been treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterobacter cloacae and is currently on a 7-day course of antibiotics. He is also being monitored for pneumonia and has been holding off on a nasogastric tube due to tolerance of oral intake. The patient's allergies include various medications and nickel, and he has had previous adverse reactions to certain drugs. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/63 mmHg to 110/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and creatinine, as well as low levels of platelets and albumin. The assessment and plan include managing urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and end-stage renal disease. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF admitted after
   witnessed PEA arrest in the ED. Cath showed stenotic RCA. PCWP was
   45mmHg. RCA was stented and hemodynamics improved with PCI. Transferred
   to the CCU on pressors initially on HD, then on CVVH due to
   hypotension.  Patient then underwent repeat cardiac catherization with
   2 stents to the LAD on [**2-16**]. Hemodynamics have progressively improved
   and pressors were discontinued. Now successfully extubated and doing
   well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, leading to improved hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and then switched to continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. Subsequently, the patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with the placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Hemodynamics continued to improve, and pressors were discontinued. The patient successfully underwent extubation and is currently doing well.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and adjustments may be necessary based on laboratory results.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving but may be multifactorial related to medications, hypotension, and ICU delirium. Close observation and management are required.
3. Fever: Although the fever curve is trending down,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. The patient was then transferred to the coronary critical care unit (CCU) on pressors initially, followed by continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. Subsequently, the patient underwent another cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [02-16]. The patient's hemodynamics gradually improved, and pressors were discontinued. She was successfully extubated and is currently doing well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management through hemodialysis or CVVH. Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting treatment accordingly is important to prevent complications associated with fluid overload or hypotension.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which may be related to medication effects, hypotension, or"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed, resulting in improved hemodynamics. She was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) initially on pressors and later on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension. The patient underwent another cardiac catheterization with placement of two stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. Her hemodynamics have progressively improved, and she was successfully extubated and doing well.

The patient's current issues include:
1. PEA arrest: Likely coronary artery disease (CAD)/ischemia post revascularization. She should continue taking aspirin, statin, and Plavix. She will be monitored on telemetry and managed for ESRD, respiratory failure (resolved), shock (resolved), and altered mental status (improving) as follows:
   - ESRD on HD/CVVH: Her blood pressure has improved, so she will now be on HD three times a week. Holding off"

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). Cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and the patient underwent RCA stenting and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). His hemodynamics improved with PCI, and he was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) initially on pressors and then on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension. The patient also underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with two stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on [2-16]. His hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. He was successfully extubated and doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESRD on HD/CVVH - The patient's blood pressure improved, and he will now be on HD three times a week. Epoetin alpha (EPO) will be withheld due to recent coronary artery intervention.
2. Altered Mental Status - The patient's mental status is improving daily, but there are concerns for anoxic brain injury from hypotension peri and post PEA arrest, especially considering his known"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department. A cardiac catheterization revealed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and the patient underwent stenting of the RCA with subsequent improvement in hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and hemodialysis (HD), then transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension. Subsequently, the patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Hemodynamics have progressively improved, and pressors were discontinued. The patient is now successfully extubated and doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ESRD on HD/CVVH - The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management with hemodialysis or CVVH. Hypotension has been an issue, and the patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored.

2. Altered Mental Status - The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is improving daily. Concerns include anoxic brain injury from hypotension during and after the PEA arrest, as well as the effects of medications, hypotension"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after hemodialysis and was scheduled for metoprolol. This could indicate a cardiovascular issue such as heart failure or low cardiac output.

2. Infection: The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterobacter cloace, which was treated with Zosyn. There is also a mention of fever, which could indicate another infection.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, but it has since resolved. This may have been due to pulmonary edema, as the patient underwent continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and then hemodialysis (HD) to improve it.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is improving daily. This could be related to medications, hypotension, anoxic brain injury from the PEA arrest, or ICU delirium with a tendency to sundown.

5. Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and was initially on pressors. Restarting lopressor and considering the addition of captopril are mentioned, indicating ongoing management of this condition.

6. Coronary artery disease/ischemia: The patient likely has coronary artery disease, as indicated by the witnessed P"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. The patient was admitted after experiencing a witnessed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency department (ED). A cardiac catheterization showed stenotic right coronary artery (RCA), and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with improvement in hemodynamics. The patient was initially on pressors and later transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension. Following another cardiac catheterization, two stents were placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's condition has progressively improved, and the pressors were discontinued. The patient is now successfully extubated and doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ESRD on HD/CVVH: The patient's chronic kidney disease requires ongoing management of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and medication adjustments. Hypotension should be monitored and treated appropriately.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving but may be multifactorial related to medications, hypotension, and ICU delirium. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications are necessary.

3. Fever: Although the fever curve is trending down, it is important"
