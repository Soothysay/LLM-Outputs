   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female s/p renal tx X3 (most recent CRT [**9-29**]) and panc X2 (most
   recent [**2-27**]), severe PVD, HTN presents with rigors/fevers and mental
   status changes.
   # Sepsis- Patient presented with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Pt with GPC growing in blood. Likely source is tunneled fem line.
   Patient does have history of VRE. Pt received vanco/imipenem.  Pt with
   immunosuppressed.  Ideally, pt would have line holiday, but pt with
   difficult access. MRV showed unable to access IJ or subclavian.  Ostomy
   further complicates fem line.  Currently hemodynamically stable
   - Will continue to treat with Imipenem/Vancomycin for broad coverage
   given h/o VRE and immunosuppression (day #1 is [**1-18**])
   - ID consult
   -f/u renal transplant recs
   - will need to discuss with Renal transplant,  regarding possible
   access options regarding removing fem line and alternate access. Will
   need additional PIV
   - TTE
   - Continue home steroids for now - received stress dose in ED
   - Goal MAP>65
   - F/U Urine culture
   - F/U Blood cultures and sensi
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen, renal transplant ultrasound, CXR
   and CT head
   - Check vanc trough after 3rd dose (day #1 [**1-18**])
   .
   # Mental Status change- Patient with acute MS changes although events
   not clear at this time. Per her husband, pt has altered MS every time
   her BP drops.  BP was low on EMS arrival. Pt does have labile BPs and
   takes both BB and fludrocortisone prn to manage her pressures. It is
   possible that infection precipitation hypotension causing the MS
   changes. Currently MS improving and appears to be mentating well.
   - CT at this point unrevealing for ICH or edema.
   - Toxic metabolic work up in place as above.
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #Apnea-Unclear if truly apneic; appears to be breathing shallow on exam
   -Monitor for now
   .
   #S/P Kidney/Pancreas Transplant-Pts creatinine slightly above baseline
   on admission; likely prerenal given hypotension/sepsis
   -Continue immunosuppressives Azathioprine, Prednisone, Tacrolimus 3mg

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, pancreas transplant, severe peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension. She presented with rigors, fever, and mental status changes. The patient has a central line infection likely due to Gram-positive cocci (GPC) growing in her blood. She also has a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and imipenem) for her infection. The source of the infection is suspected to be the tunneled femoral line. The patient is immunosuppressed and ideally should have had a line holiday, but difficult access made it challenging. The patient's renal function is slightly elevated above baseline, likely due to prerenal causes such as hypotension and sepsis.

The patient's mental status changes are thought to be related to hypotension, possibly precipitated by the infection. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and she takes both beta-blockers and fludrocortisone as needed to manage her pressures. The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and she requires continued immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient's other medical history includes blindness, anxiety, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. She requires ongoing management of her diabetes and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently not experiencing any acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female s/p renal tx X3 (most recent CRT [**9-29**]) and panc X2 (most
   recent [**2-27**]), severe PVD, HTN presents with rigors/fevers and mental
   status changes.
   # Sepsis- Patient presented with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Thus far source of infection unclear; CXR negative, CT abdomen
   unrevealing, U/A negative, Renal Ultrasound unrevealing, Lactate 2.0,
   LFTs unremarkable.  Patient does have history of VRE Peritonitis as
   well as an indwelling tunneled femoral line which is a likely source;
   at this point patient refusing line removal. CT did show maxillary
   sinusitis and pt did have recent complain of a persistant ""head cold""
   per her husband. [**Name (NI) **] source could be ostomy site given recent
   purulent drainage although exam at this point unrevealing.
   - Will continue to treat with Imipenem/Vancomycin for broad coverage
   given h/o VRE and immunosuppression (day #1 is [**1-18**])
   - Continue home steroids for now - received stress dose in ED
   - Goal MAP>65
   - F/U Urine culture
   - F/U Blood cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen, renal transplant ultrasound, CXR
   and CT head
   - Need to address access and removal of line pending culture growth
   - Check vanc trough after 3rd dose (day #1 [**1-18**])
   .
   # Mental Status change- Patient with acute MS changes although events
   not clear at this time. Per her husband, pt has altered MS every time
   her BP drops.  BP was low on EMS arrival. Pt does have labile BPs and
   takes both BB and fludrocortisone prn to manage her pressures. It is
   possible that infection precipitation hypotension causing the MS
   changes. Currently MS improving and appears to be mentating well.
   - CT at this point unrevealing for ICH or edema.
   - Toxic metabolic work up in place as above.
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #Apnea-Unclear if truly apneic; appears to be breathing shallow on exam
   -Monitor for now
   .
   #S/P Kidney/Pancreas Transplant-Pts creatinine slightly above baseline
   on admission; likely prerenal given hypotension/sepsis
   -Continue immunosuppressives Azathioprine, Prednisone, Tacrolimus 3mg
   [**Hospital1 **] (sublingual per transplant; crush meds)
   -Tacrolimus level in AM
   -Transplant Surgery/Medicine following

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, pancreas transplant, severe peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension.
- She presented with rigors/fevers and mental status changes, indicating sepsis.
- The source of infection is unclear, but possible sources include a tunneled femoral line, maxillary sinusitis, or an ostomy site.
- The patient is being treated with Imipenem/Vancomycin for broad coverage, considering her history of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) peritonitis and immunosuppression.
- Other goals include maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, following up on urine and blood cultures, and addressing access and removal of the line pending culture growth.
- The patient also has mental status changes, which may be related to her labile blood pressures and infection.
- Other issues include apnea, kidney/pancreas transplant, hypertension/orthostatic hypotension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and blindness.
- The patient's current medications include azathioprine, prednisone, tacrolimus, ativan, aspirin, cyclosporine, acular, and loteprednol etabonate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately."

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is 36.4°C, heart rate is 104 bpm, blood pressure is 179/94 mmHg, respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received fluids totaling 4,796 mL and has had a total output of 3,170 mL, including urine output of 1,720 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery at 2 liters and SpO2 at 100%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with no acute distress or eye edema. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and a systolic murmur. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. The respiratory examination is clear, with symmetric chest expansion and resonant percussion. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with ostomy site within normal limits. Extremities show emaciation but no edema. The skin is warm, and neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal movement and tone.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 2.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 151 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 108 mg/dL, and sodium of 139 mEq/L, among other values. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending.

The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, GPC bacteremia, and a history of VRE bacteremia. The plan includes continuing imipenem and vancomycin, monitoring for recurrent fever, and broadening coverage as appropriate. An ID consult is requested for long-term management, and alternative access options for the patient's line will be discussed with the renal team. A TTE will be obtained, and a prolonged course of therapy is considered due to the patient's upper extremity clots and the question of septic thrombophlebitis.

The patient also has a diagnosis of anxiety, for which benzodiazepines will be prescribed. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and metoprolol short-acting will be resumed. The rest of the plan will be managed by the HO team.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving, with stable vital signs and appropriate management of sepsis and bacteremia. However, potential complications to monitor for include recurrent fever, septic thrombophlebit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of allergies to Betadine, nitroglycerin, gabapentin, cilostazol, and colestipol. The patient received antibiotics, including vancomycin, and is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium and famotidine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,153 mL positive, with total input of 3,953 mL and total output of 2,800 mL. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and albumin. However, the patient's potassium level is slightly elevated at 5.0 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing management suggest a possible ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not adequately controlled.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates that the patient may be at risk for fluid overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
   relatively fixed 1.4cm echodensity is seen in the body of the right
   atrium (?catheter, ?mass). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction
   at rest or with Valsalva. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, pancreatic transplant, severe peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension. She presented with rigors, fevers, and mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently receiving vancomycin. The source of infection is suspected to be the tunneled femoral line. The patient also has a new atrial echogenic mass seen on transthoracic echo. Her mental status changes may be related to hypotension or infection. She has a history of kidney/pancreas transplants and is on immunosuppressive medications. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Infection Precipitated Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be causing her mental status changes. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure to prevent further complications.
3. Atrial Echogenic Mass: The new atrial echogenic mass could potentially be a thrombus or a mass, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine level is slightly above baseline, indicating possible prerenal azotemia due to hypotension and sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Hypertension/Orthostatic:"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
   relatively fixed 1.4cm echodensity is seen in the body of the right
   atrium (?catheter, ?mass). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction
   at rest or with Valsalva. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-1-26**], the right
   atrial ""echogenic mass"" is new. Is there a femoral line (could inject
   agitated saline to confirm this is a catheter). If not, a thoracic CT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female who has a history of renal transplant (CRT) and pancreatic transplant (panc), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and blindness. She is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, mental status changes, apnea, and other medical conditions.

From the review of systems, the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/78 to 126/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals an echogenic mass in the right atrium, which is a new finding compared to the previous study. The echogenic mass could potentially be a catheter or a mass itself. Further imaging, such as a thoracic CT or MR, may be necessary to better define the abnormality.

The patient has a history of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and is currently on vancomycin. She also has a tunneled femoral line, which is suspected as the likely source of infection.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who has undergone renal and pancreatic transplants, with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and chronic anxiety. The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and mental status changes.

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to the presence of rigors/fevers and mental status changes. A Gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection was identified in the blood culture. The likely source of infection is the tunneled femoral line. The patient has a history of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization. Vancomycin and imipenem were administered. The patient is immunocompromised, making it difficult to replace the femoral line with an internal jugular or subclavian line. Ideally, the femoral line should be removed and replaced with a left line via interventional radiology (IR) today. ID consultation recommended continuing vancomycin and monitoring for culture sensitivities. Follow-up with final read of CT abdomen, renal transplant ultrasound, chest X-ray, and CT head.

2. Mental status change: The patient experienced acute mental status changes, although the events are unclear at this time. The patient's husband reported that the patient has altered mental status every time her blood pressure drops. The patient's blood pressure was low upon EMS arrival. It is possible"

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2135-1-19**] 01:30 PM
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
   relatively fixed 1.4cm echodensity is seen in the body of the right
   atrium (?catheter, ?mass). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction
   at rest or with Valsalva. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-1-26**], the right
   atrial ""echogenic mass"" is new. Is there a femoral line (could inject
   agitated saline to confirm this is a catheter). If not, a thoracic CT
   or MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1613**] may better define the abnormality.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other supportive treatments. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. 

The patient has a mass in the right atrium (RA), which was identified through a trans thoracic echo. Further imaging modalities will be discussed with echocardiography to determine the best approach for further evaluation of the RA mass. 

The patient also has a history of allergies, including anaphylaxis to Nitroglycerin, headache with Gabapentin, delirium with Cilostazol, and rash with both Colestipol and certain antibiotics. 

In terms of potential medical complications, there are several possibilities to consider:

1. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics and has a blood culture drawn due to concerns of possible infection. Monitoring for any signs of sepsis or worsening infection is important.

2. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Close monitoring for signs of thrombosis or bleeding complications is necessary.

3. Cardiovascular issues: The presence of a mass in the RA may have implications for the patient's cardiac function. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to assess any potential cardiac complications.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/66 mmHg to 169/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's cardiovascular system shows normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient attentive, but movement, tone, and other neurological assessments are not performed.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 165 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels at 126 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin levels at 12.0 g/dL. Other lab values, such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, albumin, and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges. Blood cultures show no new data, while microbiology results for the catheter tip are pending.

Assessment and plan include a right atrial mass, which requires further imaging discussion with echocardiography. The patient's anxiety has improved,"

   recent [**2-27**]), severe PVD, HTN presents with rigors/fevers and mental
   status changes.
   # Sepsis- Patient presented with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Pt with GPC growing in blood. Likely source is tunneled fem line.
   Patient does have history of VRE. Pt received vanco/imipenem.  Pt with
   immunosuppressed.  Ideally, pt would have line holiday, but pt with
   difficult access. MRV showed unable to access IJ or subclavian.
   Patient received new tunneled line to left groin [**1-20**].  New culture
   data overnight with 1 bottle coag negative staph.
   - Continue vancomycin Day #4 (first dose 1/26)

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who has undergone renal and pancreatic transplants, and has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and mental status changes. The patient's recent medical history includes three renal transplants and two pancreatic transplants. She also has a history of blindness, anxiety, and tachycardia.

24-hour events:
- The patient showed a right atrial clot secondary to a tunneled line, and a clot in the inferior vena cava (IVC). She was started on heparin and coumadin.
- The patient only has one lumen on her line, so she had to hold heparin to give vancomycin.
- Blood cultures grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and the likely source is the tunneled femoral line. She was given vancomycin and imipenem.
- The patient received a new tunneled line to her left groin on 1/20. New culture data overnight showed one bottle of coag-negative staph.
- She will continue vancomycin on day #4 (first dose on 1/26).
- Her recent atrial echogenic mass is concerning for a new atrial clot, and she needs to discuss this with ID regarding the duration of antibiotics.
- She has mental status changes"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of heart transplant presenting to the ICU for evaluation. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the progress note.

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, most likely caused by a coag-negative staphylococcus infection. This is a serious condition that requires immediate attention and management.

2. Right atrial clot: An overnight echocardiogram showed a blood clot in the patient's right atrium. This clot needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.

3. S/p transplant: The patient has had a previous heart transplant, which puts him at higher risk for infections and other complications related to immunosuppression.

4. Antibiotic management: The patient has been on a prolonged course of vancomycin due to the presence of RA and IVC clot. It is important to monitor the effectiveness of the antibiotics and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.

5. Heparin therapy: The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin. However, there is a plan to transition to coumadin bridge therapy. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status is necessary to ensure proper anticoagulation.

6. Anxiety and supportive care: The patient is experiencing anxiety, and supportive care measures should be continued to alleviate the patient's symptoms.

","The patient is a 51-year-old female who has undergone renal and pancreatic transplants. She presents with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. A coag-negative staph infection is identified in her blood, likely originating from a tunneled femoral line. She is currently on vancomycin therapy for the infection. 

The patient has severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and hypertension. She also has a history of right atrial clot, for which she is being treated with heparin and Coumadin. 

She is on immunosuppressive therapy to manage her transplants, including medications such as Azathioprine, Prednisone, and Tacrolimus. Her target Tacrolimus level is between 6-30 ng/mL, and she is also taking Bactrim for prophylaxis. 

The patient has a history of blindness, anxiety, and tachycardia. She is currently receiving treatment with Klonopin and Ambien for anxiety. 

She is receiving nutrition through regular diet and her glycemic control is being monitored. She has a tunneled (Hickman) line for central access. Prophylaxis is provided for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis is also being administered. 

The patient's code status is full code, and she is being called out to the floor for further care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who has undergone renal and pancreatic transplants. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, a right atrial clot, and other medical complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 135/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has multiple allergies and is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, heparin, famotidine, and more. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's recent medical history includes rigors, fevers, mental status changes, hypertension, and blindness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggests sepsis. The presence of coag-negative staph growing in her blood indicates a bacterial infection, which may be related to a tunneled femoral line.
2. Right atrial clot: The patient has a confirmed right atrial clot, for which she is being treated with heparin and coumadin. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism or further clot formation.
3. Infection in the tunneled line: The patient's central line is suspected to be the source"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of anxiety, which is being managed with clonazepam. The patient also has hypertension, currently being monitored and treated with toprol. Additionally, the patient has a renal transplant and is on tacrolimus, with a recent dose reduction. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,512 mL and output of 2,575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,063 mL. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating, with values ranging from 2.5 to 2.9 K/uL. Other lab results, including Hct, Plt, Cr, Glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges. The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, for which they received vancomycin treatment. They also have a right atrial clot and are being treated with heparin, which will be changed to lovenox. The patient's current disposition is to be transferred to the floor after contact with case management for discharge planning and setting up VNA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, and although they were treated with vancomycin, there is still a risk of developing further infections due to their immunocompromised state"
