   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (bacterial community-acquired), and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The presence of multifocal pneumonia and a moderate right pleural effusion raises concerns for potential respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and possible respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's new onset atrial fibrillation may be a result of severe pneumonia, hypoxia, and sepsis. Close monitoring is necessary to assess for cardiac arrhythmias, and rate controlling agents may be required if the patient's condition stabilizes.

3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 3.5. Ongoing monitoring of renal function is crucial to prevent further deterioration and to adjust medication dosages accordingly.

4. Hematological Complications: The patient exhibits anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant bandemia. These findings suggest the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and past alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (likely community-acquired), and acute renal failure. The initial assessment suggests a possible bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus pneumo, but other considerations include Legionella given the associated nausea and vomiting.

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam. Thoracentesis was performed yesterday with a pH of 7.1, and there is a concern for loculation. A thoracic surgery consultation has been requested for possible decortication in the next 24-48 hours. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is being maintained below 10 with the administration of intravenous fluids. Pressors have been held off.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to sepsis and volume depletion. A renal ultrasound has been ordered to evaluate for post-obstructive causes, although this is unlikely. The patient's medications will be renally dosed, and nephrotoxins will be avoided. The patient has shown significant improvement and is expected to recover.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia"

   #Sepsis - likely [**12-25**] pneumonia given RLL infiltrate/effusion on CXR, no
   evidence of urine infection at this time.  Most likely CAP vs
   aspiration pneumonia given h/o profuse vomiting prior to onset of
   dyspnea.  Severity of systemic illness worrisome for staph or strep
   pneumo.  Other consideration is legionella given associated nausea and
   vomiting as well as significant hypoxia on admission.
   -vanc/levo for now to cover for CAP and possiblity of MRSA pna
   -will add aztreonam given sepsis for improved strep pneumo coverage
   - thoracentesis if effusion is large enough
   -IVF for CVP >10 (already given 7L IVF in ED)
   -phenylephrine for MAP >55
   -f/u blood cx, urine cx, stool cx
   -send sputum culture
   -urine legionella antigen
   -place aline for bp and oxygenation monitoring
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 5278**] sediment, moderate amount
   of blood but no casts on urine microscopy.  CK is not elevated.  Per
   patient no history of kidney disease at baseline.  Likely [**12-25**] sepsis
   and volume depletion.
   -renal ultrasound to eval for post obstructive cause although unlikely
   -monitor creatinine, would expect improvement given signific volume
   resuscitation in the ED
   -renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   -already given 7L IVF in ED and CVP 10 on admission, hold off on
   further volume resuscitation for now
   .
   #anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant
   bandemia - likely [**12-25**] severe pneumonia and sepsis.   Also worrisome for
   possibility of DIC
   -manual smear
   -monitor cbc, diff
   -fibrinogen, fdp, ddimer to eval for DIC
   -iron studies, retic count to eval anemia
   -type and screen
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation
 appears to be new onset while in ED likely [**12-25**]
   severe pneumonia, hypoxia and sepsis.  He was started on heparin gtt in
   the ED presumably in case of need for cardioversion given concurrent
   hypotension.
   -monitor on tele
   -hold off on rate controlling agents given hypotension
   -hold heparin gtt for now as plan for thoracentesis, may consider
   restarting if afib persistent and clinically stable if plan for

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and acute renal failure. He has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (likely community-acquired or aspiration pneumonia), and possible ETOH withdrawal. Other considerations include Legionella pneumonia given associated nausea and vomiting. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, IV fluids, and medications for ETOH withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's condition may worsen if he develops respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration.
2. Renal complications: Acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation, leading to potential heart complications.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system from sepsis and pneumonia.
5. Alcohol withdrawal complications: If not managed appropriately, the patient may experience severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures or delirium tremens.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and sepsis increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. Here is a summary of the information and potential complications:

1. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis due to suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The severity of illness suggests the possibility of staph or strep pneumo infection. Other considerations include Legionella given associated nausea and vomiting.

2. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Intubation was necessary for airway protection due to hypoxemia and tachypnea.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but it has since resolved. The cause of renal failure was likely sepsis and volume depletion.

4. Depressed Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): The patient has a globally reduced LVEF of 35%. This could be due to sepsis, ETOH abuse, or other underlying cardiac conditions.

5. Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Relative Leukopenia with Bandemia: The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and relative leukopenia with significant bandemia. This could be secondary to severe pneumonia and sepsis, raising concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed new-onset"

   failure.
   .
   #Sepsis - likely [**12-25**] pneumonia given RLL infiltrate/effusion on CXR, no
   evidence of urine infection at this time.  Most likely CAP vs
   aspiration pneumonia given h/o profuse vomiting prior to onset of
   dyspnea.  Severity of systemic illness worrisome for staph or strep
   pneumo.  Other consideration is legionella given associated nausea and
   vomiting as well as significant hypoxia on admission.   Intubated this
   AM for ETOH withdrawal, hypoxemia on NRB, tachypnea.
   - continue aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin

   #Acute Renal Failure - with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 5278**] sediment, moderate amount
   of blood but no casts on urine microscopy.  CK is not elevated.  Per
   patient no history of kidney disease at baseline.  Likely [**12-25**] sepsis
   and volume depletion.  Resolved.
   -Cr 0.8 now

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and acute renal failure. He was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), acute renal failure, alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate suggests pneumonia as the likely source of infection. The severity of systemic illness raises concern for staph or strep pneumonia. Other considerations include Legionella given associated nausea and vomiting as well as significant hypoxia on admission.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray indicates pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is a possibility given the patient's symptoms and risk factors.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but it has since resolved. The cause of the renal failure is likely sepsis and volume depletion.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, such as agitation and diaphoresis. Intubation may be necessary due to hypoxemia and tachypnea.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5277**] is a 46 yo M with PMH HTN, hyperlipid, h/o ETOH abuse
   presenting with hypotension, hypoxia RLL infiltrate, loculated
   effusion, active ETOH withdrawal
   .
   #Sepsis - likely [**12-25**] pneumonia given RLL infiltrate/effusion on CXR, no
   evidence of urine infection at this time.  Most likely CAP vs
   aspiration pneumonia given h/o profuse vomiting prior to onset of
   dyspnea.  Severity of systemic illness worrisome for staph or strep
   pneumo.  Other consideration is legionella given associated nausea and
   vomiting as well as significant hypoxia on admission.   Intubated this
   AM for ETOH withdrawal, hypoxemia on NRB, tachypnea.
   - continue aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - wean vent settings throughout the day, low tidal volumes 7mg/kg given
   concern for development of ARDS
   - hold SQ heparin for now given likely chest tube placement
   - f/u CXR for ETT placement- in good position
   - thoracentesis with pH 7.1, CT with ? of loculation
   - thoracics on board for likely decortication vs chest tube today
   -IVF for decrease in UOP
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, stool cx- NGTD
   - resend blood cx
   -send sputum culture if able to provide sample
   -urine legionella antigen negative
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal- history of ETOH abuse in past, unclear per family
   current amount of use
   - propofol gtt
   - thiamine IV
   - folate IV
   - place PICC line
   - motor neuro exam unrevealing, no focal deficits, if change then
   obtain CT head
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 5278**] sediment, moderate amount
   of blood but no casts on urine microscopy.  CK is not elevated.  Per
   patient no history of kidney disease at baseline.  Likely [**12-25**] sepsis
   and volume depletion.  Resolved.
   -Cr 0.8 now
   -renal ultrasound negative
   .
   # Depressed EF- DDX includes tachycardia from afib rate in 130s during
   TTE, sepsis, ETOH given global depression
   - will need repeat TTE prior to discharge to reevaluate EF, no valvular
   process
   .
   #anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant
   bandemia - likely [**12-25**] severe pneumonia and sepsis.   Also worrisome for
   possibility of DIC
   -plt normal, anemia stable
   -monitor cbc, diff
   -fibrinogen, fdp, ddimer to eval for DIC negative
   -ferritin >1000,
   -active type and screen
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation
 appears to be new onset while in ED likely [**12-25**]
   severe pneumonia, hypoxia and sepsis.  He was started on heparin gtt in
   the ED presumably in case of need for cardioversion given concurrent
   hypotension.
   - back in SR after IV diltiazem, confirmed on ECG
   -monitor on tele
   - d/c lopressor
   .
   # ACCESS-  3 PIV, arterial line placement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. The patient was intubated for ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia, and tachypnea. He required mechanical ventilation and received broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's chest tube was placed at the bedside by CT surgery. He continues to require pressor support with neosynephrine and has a fever of 103°F. The patient also has hives, which improved with Benadryl. The chest tube output is 350 cc.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.0°F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/68 mmHg to 128/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, but it has improved since admission. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected of having sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and hypotension. The patient has been intubated due to worsening agitation and desaturation. Initial sedation was provided with propofol but was switched to fentanyl/versed due to hypotension. A chest tube was placed at the bedside by CT surgery, and the right internal jugular (RIJ) line was replaced in the afternoon. The patient continues to require pressor support with neosynephrine and has a fever of 103 degrees. Chest tube output is 350 cc. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, ceftriaxone, and hives. Recent antibiotics include levofloxacin, vancomycin, and aztreonam. The patient is on multiple infusions including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), and phenylephrine. Other ICU medications include diazepam (Valium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, along with the presence of pneumonia on imaging studies, indicate a possible bacterial community-acquired"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. The patient was initially on propofol for sedation but was switched to fentanyl/versed due to hypotension. A chest tube was placed at the bedside by CT surgery, and the right internal jugular vein was replaced in the afternoon. The patient requires pressor support with neosynephrine and continues to have hives, which improved with Benadryl. His temperature spiked to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The chest tube output is 350 cc. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, ceftriaxone, and an unknown allergy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active alcohol withdrawal. The patient was intubated for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant bandemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple antibiotics, and being treated for various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including hypoxia and right lower lobe infiltrate, suggest a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The most likely pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Close monitoring for worsening respiratory status and antibiotic resistance is essential.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of pneumonia and systemic signs of infection, sepsis is a concern. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and urine output is necessary. Early identification and prompt management of sepsis are crucial to prevent organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, which have now resolved. However, careful monitoring of renal function is required due to"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse, presenting with hypotension, hypoxia right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. The patient's clinical picture is worrisome for severe Strep pneumonia infection. He continues to require pressor support, with a temperature up to 103 overnight. The patient has been intubated for ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia on non-rebreather mask, and tachypnea. The patient's urine Legionella antigen test was negative.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has large right lower lobe pneumonia with gram-positive chains in the pleural fluid, consistent with exudative parapneumonic effusion. The worsening right-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests worsening consolidation. The patient has undergone right chest tube placement with about 400 mL output, and the chest tube is in good position. The patient is being treated with aztreonam, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Clindamycin will be added to cover for anaerobes. A follow-up chest X-ray will be obtained to evaluate the worsening infiltrate and consider the possibility of consolidation versus loculated effusion. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) will also be performed to further evaluate the worsening infiltrate. Intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition :
   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presents with right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and a complex parapneumonic effusion/empyema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to agitation, likely related to alcohol withdrawal. He has been receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam for his pneumonia. The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) that has resolved, new depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), anemia of uncertain etiology, and pulmonary embolism (PAF) now in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL PNA with a complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema. There is a risk of worsening infection and possible spread of the infection to other areas of the lungs.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of agitation, likely due to alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens if not properly managed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although the patient's AKI has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if there are ongoing issues with fluid balance or renal perfusion.
4. Depressed Ejection Fraction: The patient has a new-onset depressed LVEF,"

   right lung. While the superior region may represent fluid in the major
   fissure, the posterior right lower lobe finding is concerning for
   small area of necrosis.
   2. Interval placement of a right chest tube since the prior CT scan
   with
   interval improvement in the right pleural effusion. A trace right
   pleural
   effusion persists.
   3. Fat stranding is seen medial to the right internal jugular vein.
   While
   this finding may be related to right IJ line placement,
   thrombophlebitis is
   not excluded. An ultrasound may be useful for further evaluation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. He was intubated for ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia, and tachypnea. The patient's clinical picture is worrisome for severe Strep pneumo infection. He requires pressor support and has a temperature up to 103 degrees Celsius. The chest X-ray shows worsening right-sided infiltrate, which could be worsening consolidation or persistent loculated effusion. The patient underwent right chest tube placement with about 400 ml output, and the thoracic feels that the chest tube is in good position and believes that the worsening infiltrate is likely consolidation.

The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), acute renal failure (resolved), depressed EF (ejection fraction), anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant bandemia, atrial fibrillation, and access issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal consolidation with slight interval improvement in the right lower lobe. There are two regions of round hypoenhancement seen in the posterior right lung. While the superior region may represent fluid in the major fissure, the posterior right lower lobe finding is concerning for a small area of necrosis."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown measurement. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis and pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/72 mmHg to 126/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal ventilation with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a chest tube in the right lung due to persistent opacity and pleural effusion. The chest tube has helped in draining the fluid and improving the condition. The patient is also receiving continuous infusions of midazolam, fentanyl, and phenylephrine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (21.7 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (10.8 g/dL), and normal platelet count (200 K/uL). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level (3.0 mEq/L). The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 88 mg/dL and 114 mg/dL. Other lab results including kidney function tests, liver enzymes"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by a severe Strep pneumonia infection. The patient's clinical picture includes hypotension, hypoxia, and a right lower lobe pneumonia with GPC in chains on gram stain of pleural fluid. This suggests a complex parapneumonic effusion versus empyema.

2. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient presents with hypotension, hypoxia, and right lower lobe infiltrate, which are consistent with CAP. The worsening infiltrate on the CXR indicates worsening consolidation or persistent loculated effusion.

3. Ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal: The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is currently experiencing symptoms of ETOH withdrawal. The patient is sedated with midazolam (versed) for ETOH withdrawal and hypoxemia on NRB, as well as tachypnea.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure but has since resolved with IVF (intravenous fluids) and is now back to baseline.

5. Depressed ejection fraction (EF): The patient has a depressed EF, which may be due to tachycardia from atrial fibrillation rate in the 130s during TTE (trans"

   posterior
   right lung. While the superior region may represent fluid in the major
   fissure, the posterior right lower lobe finding is concerning for
   small area of necrosis.
   2. Interval placement of a right chest tube since the prior CT scan
   with
   interval improvement in the right pleural effusion. A trace right
   pleural
   effusion persists.
   3. Fat stranding is seen medial to the right internal jugular vein.
   While
   this finding may be related to right IJ line placement,
   thrombophlebitis is
   not excluded. An ultrasound may be useful for further evaluation

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), acute renal failure (resolved), depressed ejection fraction, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and access issues.

The patient's current condition includes being sedated, intubated, on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP to 8, receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin, clindamycin, midazolam, fentanyl, phenylephrine, and others. The patient has a chest tube in place for drainage of pleural effusion and is receiving chest physiotherapy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/72 mmHg to 126/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological status is deferred due to sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Blood cultures are negative for any organisms. Imaging studies reveal multifocal consolidation in"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal.

The patient was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP). He has been experiencing fever up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit, worsening right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray, and persistent loculated effusion. A right chest tube was placed, with about 400 mL output.

The patient is currently intubated for ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia, and tachypnea. His urine Legionella antigen test was negative. The CT chest showed slight improvement in the right lower lobe infiltrate and pleural effusion, but there is still a concern for an area of lung necrosis.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin. The vancomycin dose has been increased to 1g IV every 8 hours. The thoracic team is recommending obtaining a sputum sample, possibly considering decortication if there is no improvement. Heparin SQ has also been restarted.

Other issues noted in the progress note include acute renal failure, which has resolved with intravenous fluids,"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with pneumonia (PNA) and complicated empyema. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.7 K/uL and elevated D-dimer levels at 2690 ng/mL. Other labs indicate mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST).

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin, and clindamycin. Clindamycin and levofloxacin will be switched to intravenous administration. The patient will undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage today. The target central venous pressure (CVP) is set between 8-10 mmHg. The patient will be sedated with propofol instead of midazolam. Ethanol withdrawal symptoms are being managed with versed, and the patient's sedation will be switched to propofol as well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. He was intubated for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia on NRB. The patient had a large right lower lobe pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in chains on gram stain of pleural fluid, consistent with complex parapneumonic effusion versus empyema. He required pressor support, and his temperature reached 103 degrees. The chest X-ray showed worsening right-sided infiltrate, unclear if worsening consolidation or persistent loculated effusion. A chest tube was placed, and about 400ml output thoracics were felt to be in good position, with worsening infiltrate likely consolidation. The patient's urine Legionella antigen was negative. A CT chest showed slight improvement in right lower lobe infiltrate/pleural effusion, though there was an area of lung necrosis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin. His blood cultures were negative for growth. The patient's current clinical picture is worrisome for severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He is also being treated for ethanol withdrawal with Versed and thiamine. The patient's respiratory failure is due to withdrawal, and he will"

","The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, aztreonam, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 2198-3-4 at 04:56 PM, urine culture on the same day, and sputum culture on 2198-3-4 at 08:42 PM and 2198-3-5 at 05:17 AM.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, ceftriaxone, and unknown allergens. The patient has received multiple infusions of propofol and is on other ICU medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 60-105 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 59-99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 and improvement in mean arterial pressure (MAPs). The patient has received a total of 4,676 mL of fluid intake and 4,360 mL of fluid output, resulting in a fluid balance of 316 mL positive. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at a volume control mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 47 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 142 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 10.2 L/min.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to sedation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 21.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 34.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 200 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP). The patient is receiving ICU care, including glycemic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. He was intubated for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia on NRB, and his condition worsened, leading to the diagnosis of severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He required pressor support and chest tube placement due to a large right lower lobe pneumonia with pleural fluid showing gram-positive cocci in chains, indicating a complex parapneumonic effusion vs empyema.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient presented with hypotension, fever, and worsening right-sided infiltrate, indicating a severe bacterial infection.
2. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient had a large right lower lobe pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in chains on gram stain of pleural fluid, suggesting Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient was intubated for ethanol withdrawal and subsequent hypoxemia on NRB.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which resolved with intravenous fluids (IVF).
5. Depressed ejection fraction (EF): The patient had a depressed EF, likely due to sepsis, ethanol abuse, or global depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and active alcohol withdrawal. He was intubated due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and pressor support. He has a chest tube placed for a complex parapneumonic effusion. There are concerns about worsening consolidation or persistent loculated effusion. The patient also has anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis due to severe pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs, blood cultures, and administering appropriate antibiotics.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with worsening right-sided infiltrate. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. Chest X-rays should be done regularly to assess any changes.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring of his withdrawal symptoms using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) scale is required. Administration of propofol and thiamine should be continued.
4. Depressed Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: The patient has a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Repeat ech"

   presenting with hypotension, hypoxia RLL infiltrate, loculated
   effusion, active ETOH withdrawal
   .
   #Sepsis - [**12-25**] large RLL pneumonia with GPC
s in chains on gram stain of
   pleural fluid which was c/w complex parapneumonic effusion vs empyema.
   Currnet cliical picture worrisome for sever Strep penumo infection.
   Continues to require pressor support, with temp up to 103.  CXR with
   worsening right sided infiltrate, unclear if worsening consolidation or
   persistent loculated effusion.  He is s/p right chest tube placement
   with about 400ml output thoracics feels that chest tube in good
   position and feels that worsening infiltrate likely consolidation.
   Intubated [**3-3**] for ETOH withdrawal, hypoxemia on NRB, tachypnea.  Urine
   legionella antigen negative.  CT chest [**3-3**] with slight improvement in
   RLL infiltrate/pleural effusion, though ? area of lung necrosis
   - continue aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin day 6, added clindamycin
   day 4
   - vanco increased to 1g q8, trough [**3-5**] low -> increase to 1250mg IV q8
   and follow trough
   - thoracics recommending [**Last Name (un) 1599**] to obtain sputum sample, ? decortication
   if no improvement
   - restart heparin SQ
   - Daily CXR
   - IVF boluses prn for decrease in UOP or CVP <80
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, stool cx- NGTD
   will need IVF bolus
   - consider repeat TTE given persistent hypotension, CVP 6
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in the setting of withdrawal
   - Will wean and plan to extubate if Thoracics is not planning to
   intervene
   - Daily RSBIs, vent care
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal- history of ETOH abuse in past, unclear per family
   current amount of use
   - monitor on CIWA, on propofol, thiamine, folate

   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, now back to baseline.
   .
   # Depressed EF- DDX includes tachycardia from afib rate in 130s during
   TTE, sepsis, ETOH given global depression
   - will need repeat TTE prior to discharge to reevaluate EF, no valvular
   process

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ethanol abuse presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, loculated effusion, and active ethanol withdrawal. The patient was admitted with severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, which was confirmed by gram stain of pleural fluid. He also has sepsis and requires pressor support. The patient underwent right chest tube placement and has a good output of thoracic fluid. He is intubated for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia. His urine Legionella antigen is negative. A CT chest showed improvement in right lower lobe infiltrate and pleural effusion, although there is an area of lung necrosis. The patient is being treated with aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin. The plan includes increasing vancomycin to 1250 mg IV q8 and following trough levels. The patient may need decortication if there is no improvement, and heparin will be restarted. Daily CXR, IVF boluses, and repeat TTE will be considered. The patient is also being monitored for respiratory failure, ethanol withdrawal, acute renal failure (resolved), depressed EF, anemia, and atrial fibrillation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and loculated effusion. He was diagnosed with severe Streptococcus pneumonia infection and required intubation for ethanol withdrawal and respiratory failure. The patient had an acute renal failure that resolved with intravenous fluids, but now shows signs of post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. He also has a depressed ejection fraction, anemia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation which has since converted back to sinus rhythm. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen central line, and is on various prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on a full code status and is being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's right lower lobe infiltrate and symptoms suggest pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress, sepsis, and potentially organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes, hypotension, and increased white blood cell count indicate sepsis. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and active alcohol withdrawal. He was intubated for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He required pressor support and chest tube placement for a complex parapneumonic effusion vs empyema. The patient's current condition is worrisome due to severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He continues to require aggressive electrolyte repletion and respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's right lower lobe infiltrate suggests pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as respiratory failure, abscess formation, or pleural effusion.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and fever indicate sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is experiencing active alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, or Wernicke's encephalopathy if not properly managed.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had resolved acute renal failure that required aggressive intravenous fluid administration.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who is currently admitted to the ICU for necrotizing pneumonia and ETOH withdrawal. The patient has been experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and requires mechanical ventilation. He is also showing signs of sepsis and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition is complicated by ETOH withdrawal and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for mechanical ventilation indicate an increased risk of respiratory failure. Improving fluid status and evaluating for extubation are important factors to consider.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and need for broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest the presence of sepsis. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of infection are crucial to prevent further complications.

3. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function is currently improving, the ongoing use of pressors and fluid resuscitation may pose a risk for renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and maintaining adequate hydration are essential.

4. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the current symptoms of withdrawal indicate the need for appropriate management of ETOH withdrawal syndrome. Administering an adequate dose of benzodiazepines based on the CIWA scale is important to prevent complications associated with withdrawal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and loculated effusion. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP). He required pressor support and was intubated due to ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia, and tachypnea.

The patient's current clinical picture is worrisome for severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He continues to require pressor support, with temperature spikes throughout the day up to 103. The chest X-ray showed worsening right-sided infiltrate, as well as some left-sided infiltrates. The patient underwent a CT chest, which revealed slight improvement in the right lower lobe infiltrate/pleural effusion, though there is an area of lung necrosis. A chest tube was placed to water seal by thoracics this morning.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin on day 7, clindamycin on day 5, and pulling the chest tube today. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 212, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 13.9 x 10^9/L, with neutrophils at 89.0% and lymphocytes at 7.8%.

The patient's laboratory values show a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 25600/mm^3, platelet count of 222000/mm^3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 2690 ng/mL.

The patient's imaging studies show stable effusion bibasilar and multifocal opacities, retrocardiac consolidation, and right pleural effusion. The microbiology report indicates 1+ gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, but no growth on pleural fluid.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, but there is a risk of progression to septic shock and organ failure if the infection and inflammation are not adequately controlled.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires ventilatory support. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's severe pneumonia and necrotizing lung tissue.

3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate treatment, such as benzodiazepines, is important.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient had an episode of acute renal failure, which resolved with intravenous fluid administration. Monitoring the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent recurrence.

5. Depressed ejection fraction (EF): The patient has a depressed EF, likely due to sepsis, ethanol, and global depression. A repeat echocardiogram should be performed prior to discharge to reevaluate the EF.

6. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing anemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and complex parapneumonic effusion/empyema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. He also has sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, there is a risk of progression to septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema. If the infection spreads or if the patient develops antibiotic resistance, there is a risk of worsening pneumonia, which may require more aggressive interventions such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open surgical drainage.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which has since resolved. However, there is a risk of recurrence if the patient becomes hypotensive again or if the renal function is not closely monitored and managed.

4. Depressed Left Vent"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, pneumonia, sepsis, and alcohol withdrawal. He continues to spike fevers and produce significant secretions but is showing progress in terms of hemodynamics. The patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator overnight and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started pending culture data guidance. The plan is to repeat the pan culture overnight due to the patient's continued fever. The patient is also being treated for suspected necrotizing pneumonia, complicated parapneumonic effusion, respiratory failure, renal failure, and remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries its own risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and volutrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Necrotizing pneumonia: This type of pneumonia can lead to necrotizing infections and may require surgical intervention for drainage or debridement.

   #Sepsis - [**12-25**] large RLL pneumonia with GPC
s in chains on gram stain of
   pleural fluid which was c/w complex parapneumonic effusion vs empyema.
   Currnet cliical picture worrisome for severe Strep penumo infection.
   Continues to require pressor support, with temp spikes throughout the
   day up to 103.  CXR with worsening right sided infiltrate, also some
   left sided infiltrates as wellIntubated [**3-3**] for ETOH withdrawal,
   hypoxemia on NRB, tachypnea.  Urine legionella antigen negative.  CT
   chest [**3-3**] with slight improvement in RLL infiltrate/pleural effusion,
   though ? area of lung necrosis.  Chest tube put to water seal by
   thoracics this morning.
   - thoracics to pull chest tube today likely
   - continue aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin day 7, clindamycin day 5
   - SBT this AM and plan for extubation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current clinical picture, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to a severe Strep pneumonia infection. This is a serious complication characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which is a lung infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. In this case, it appears to be bacterial pneumonia, possibly complicated by parapneumonic effusion or empyema.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support. This indicates respiratory failure, which may be due to the pneumonia and associated complications such as lung necrosis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of ETOH (ethanol) abuse and is currently undergoing withdrawal. This can lead to symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had resolved acute renal failure, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis or sepsis. However, there is ongoing monitoring of fluid status to prevent post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis.

6. Depressed EF: The patient has a depressed ejection fraction (EF), which may be due to seps"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He presented with hypotension, hypoxia, right lower lobe infiltrate, and a complex parapneumonic effusion/empyema. He required intubation for ethanol withdrawal and hypoxemia. The patient had severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, which led to sepsis and organ dysfunction. He was treated with antibiotics (aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin) and chest tube placement. His current clinical picture is worrisome for severe Strep pneumonia infection. He continues to require pressor support and has had temperature spikes throughout the day. The patient's condition is stable, and he is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to a severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis if the infection does not fully resolve or if new infections occur.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient had organ dysfunction, specifically acute renal failure, which resolved with intravenous fluids. There is a possibility of recurrence if the patient does not maintain adequate fluid status.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening lung infiltrates or development of new lung infections.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, pneumonia, sepsis, and ETOH withdrawal. He continues to make progress in terms of hemodynamics but still has significant secretions. He was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Ethanol withdrawal is complicating care, and the patient's alcohol withdrawal symptoms are being managed with appropriate medication based on the CIWA scale. The patient also has a new onset of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Sepsis: Empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for presumed necrotizing pneumonia. Narrow coverage will be continued if the patient continues to do well. Pressors have been discontinued as the patient has been hemodynamically stable for 48 hours.
2. Necrotizing PNA: A complicated parapneumonic effusion is present, with a chest tube placed and minimal drainage. The management of the chest tube will be deferred to the CT service.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well on NC oxygen.
4. Renal failure: Resolved.
5. ETOH abuse: CIWA scale is being used to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and a referral to rehabilitation services at"
