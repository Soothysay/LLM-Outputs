 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
 CHEST PAIN
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   This is a 34y/o M with a PMH of ESRD secondary to glomerulonephritis on
   HD awaiting transplant, history of recurrent MSSA endocarditis on
   chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy presenting with fever, chest
   pain with associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular
   procedure.
   # Fever/CP - Given prior history of endovascular infection and recent
   manipulation of AVF, concern for bacteremia. The episodes of concurrent
   fever and chest pain are also concerning for recurrent endocarditis.
   ECG changes may be consistent with loss of integrity of aortic valve or
   disruption of coronary (LM). Fever may be caused by underlying ACS
   however the patient had a normal exercise stress in [**2164**] and small risk
   for atherosclerotic disease. As far as other sources of fever, CXR
   without evidence of infection. Pt is anuric. He has no current GI
   symptoms concerning for etiology.  Echo is shows worsening of AR and
   thickened leaflets, but so no obious vegitations (however was a TTE).
   - Will continue vancomycin for empiric coverage
   - Will give one dose of gent to cover GN infections and for synergy for
   GPC
   - Appreciate Cardiology recommendations
   - Will continue ASA and statin
   - If CP reoccurs or new EKG changes will consider emergent TEE,
   otherwise NPO for TEE in AM
   - Evaluate L AVF and vascular flow in arm by Ultrasound in AM
   - Blood cultures so far showing GPC
   - Cycle CE
   - follow on telemetry

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, on hemodialysis (HD) awaiting transplant, and a history of recurrent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. The patient presented with fever, chest pain, and associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular procedure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.4Â°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure in the low 80's, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. The patient's physical examination revealed well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and a murmur throughout the precordium. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T, and other abnormal lab values. Imaging studies revealed severe aortic regurgitation, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with normal left ventricular systolic function, and no definite masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. The patient was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, chest pain, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin for empiric coverage, giving one dose of gentamicin for synergy against gram-positive cocci, and following cardiology recommendations. The patient is NPO for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the morning and will have an ultrasound evaluation of the left arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and vascular flow in the arm. Blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of aortic regurgitation: The patient's echocardiogram shows worsening of aortic regurgitation, which can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function.
2. Heart failure: The combination of severe aortic regurgitation and the moderately dilated left ventricular cavity puts the patient at risk for developing heart failure.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, positive blood cultures, and history of recurrent endocarditis, there is a risk of sepsis, especially if the infection spreads beyond the heart valves.
4. Renal failure: The patient already has end-stage renal disease, and any further deterioration in kidney function could worsen his condition.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's ECG changes may indicate compromised coronary artery flow due to the aortic valve dysfunction, which can lead to arrhythmias.
6. Infection spread: If the bacterial infection from the endocarditis spreads to other parts of the body, it could result in severe complications such as septic emboli or abscesses.
7. Complications related to hemodialysis: The patient's reliance on hemodialysis increases the risk of complications such as hypotension"

   atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
   color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). No aortic plaque was identified to 47 centimeters from the
   incisors. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis with
   thickened leaflets is present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   IMPRESSION: Due to presence of thickening of valve leaflets and
   annulus, a focal vegetation or abscess cannot be definitely excluded,
   however no discrete vegetation or abscess is appreciated on the current
   study. Well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate to severe
   aortic regurgitation.
   Compared to the previous TEE, performed on [**2163-9-15**], the severity of
   aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation appear to have increased

","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, on hemodialysis awaiting transplant, and history of recurrent MSSA endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. He presented with fever, chest pain, and associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular procedure. 

The ultrasound of the left AV fistula showed a non-occlusive thrombus within the left basilic vein within the left forearm and an area of stenosis in the AV fistula seen in the mid-upper arm. The patient has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and access will be an issue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, awaiting transplant, and a history of recurrent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. He presents with fever, chest pain with associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular procedure. Multiple blood cultures have returned positive for vancomycin/ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus. There are concerns for recurrent bacteremia and seeding by the infected arteriovenous (AV) fistula. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is negative for vegetations, but a follow-up TEE is planned for valvular vegetations, abscesses, or signs of dehiscence of surgically altered coronary anatomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient has a history of recurrent MSSA endocarditis, and current blood cultures are positive for vancomycin/ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus. This suggests a high risk of bacterial endocarditis. Immediate antibiotic treatment is necessary to prevent further complications such as heart valve damage, abscess formation, or systemic infection.

2. AV fistula infection: The AV fistula, used for hemodialysis, appears to have been seeded with bacteria, leading to recurrent bacteremia. This increases the risk of infection spreading to"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis and recurrent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy.
- The patient presented with fever, chest pain with associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular procedure.
- Blood cultures have returned positive for sensitive Enterococcus, indicating possible bacteremia or recurrent seeding by the infected arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
- A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which did not reveal vegetations but showed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. The TEE will be followed up for further evaluation of valvular vegetations, abscesses, or signs of dehiscence of surgically altered coronary anatomy.
- The patient is currently receiving ampicillin and gentamicin for empiric coverage, with a planned dose adjustment based on gentamicin trough levels.
- The patient's platelet count is dropping, and they experienced an episode of acute shortness of breath with wheezing and rhonchi. They also coughed up blood.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of endocarditis, bacterial infection, chest pain, renal failure, and ESRD. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving IVF and PO diet. The patient's vitals include a temperature of 38.6Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine and platelets, as well as slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient is allergic to penicillins and has a history of shellfish allergy. The patient's most recent doses of antibiotics include vancomycin, gentamicin, and ampicillin. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis), fentanyl, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombus formation in the left basilic vein within the left forearm.
2. Area of stenosis in the AV fistula seen in the mid-upper arm.
3. Potential infection due to the presence of an abscess in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
4. Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, which may worsen over time.
5. Mitral regurgitation, which has increased slightly since the previous TEE.
6. Decreasing platelet count.
7. Acute episode of shortness of breath with wheezing and rhonchi.
8. Fluid overload as indicated by the chest X-ray.
9. Allergic reactions to penicillins and shellfish.
10. Risk of further complications related to the patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, awaiting transplant, and recurrent MSSA endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. He presented with fever, chest pain, and associated ECG changes following a recent endovascular procedure. Blood cultures already returned positive for GPC in pairs/chains, indicating recurrent bacteremia and possible seeding by the infected AV fistula. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was negative for vegetations, but a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed today to evaluate for valvular vegetations, abscesses, or signs of dehiscence of surgically altered coronary anatomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of recurrent MSSA endocarditis, and current symptoms such as fever and positive blood cultures suggest a possible recurrence. The TEE will help confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications like valvular vegetations or abscesses.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of GPC in blood cultures indicates bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
3. Infected AV Fistula: The non-occlusive thrombus within the left basilic vein and area of stenosis in the AV fistula suggest a possible infection. This can compromise the"

","The patient is a 34-year-old male on hemodialysis (HD) due to glomerulonephritis, awaiting renal transplant. He has a history of recurrent MSSA endocarditis on prophylactic cephalexin. The patient presents with HD-associated fevers, Enterococcus bacteremia, and chest pain event with ECG changes.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9Â°F, heart rate between 86-119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54-111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no abnormal findings in the general or neurologic assessments. However, the cardiac examination shows loud S1 and S2 sounds, a palpable thrill, and evidence of severe aortic regurgitation on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The abdominal examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, an elevated hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 83 K/uL. Renal function tests show impaired renal function with elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures are positive for sensitive Enterococcus species.

The patient's fever persists despite receiving ampicillin and gentamicin. There are"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, awaiting transplant, and a history of recurrent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. He presents with fever, chest pain with associated electrocardiogram (ECG) changes following a recent endovascular procedure.

Multiple blood cultures have returned positive for sensitive Enterococcus, indicating bacteremia. The patient's fever persists despite receiving ampicillin and gentamicin. There is concern for recurrent bacteremia and seeding of the infected arteriovenous (AV) fistula. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to assess for valvular vegetations, abscesses, or signs of dehiscence of surgically altered coronary anatomy.

The patient's chest pain and ECG changes raise concern for ischemic injury, possibly due to loss of integrity of the aortic valve or disruption of coronary flow. Cardiac enzymes are mildly elevated. The patient is already on aspirin and statin therapy. Telemetry will be continued, and cardiology has been made aware of the situation.

The patient is hypotensive at baseline, with diastolic blood pressure in the range of 20-30 mmHg overnight. Pressors are not given due to severe aortic insufficiency and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is enterococcus bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a current temperature of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and has been receiving various antibiotics including vancomycin, gentamicin, and ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/25 to 108/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1530 mL, with inputs from different sources including IV fluids. The total output was 4000 mL, with the majority being urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of 029.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, normal cardiovascular sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. However, movement, tone, and reflexes have not been assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 83 K/uL, creatinine level of 13.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 101 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, elevated CK/CKMB/Troponin-T levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan include endocarditis, bacterial infection, chest pain, renal failure (ESRD), and ongoing ICU care. The patient is currently on vancomycin and is undergoing ampicillin desensitization.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis due to persistent bacteremia, further deterioration of renal function, development of antibiotic resistance, and potential adverse reactions to medications such as ampicillin desensitization. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential in managing the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to glomerulonephritis, awaiting transplant, and a history of recurrent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis on chronic suppressive cephalexin therapy. The patient presents with sepsis, enterococcus bacteremia from blood cultures, and worsening aortic insufficiency (AI). 

Key findings and potential medical complications include:
1. Fever - The patient has had a persistent fever since admission.
2. Enterococcus bacteremia - The patient has been found to have enterococcus bacteremia from blood cultures.
3. Worsening AI - The patient's aortic insufficiency is worsening, as indicated by the transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) showing no vegetations or abscess but worsening of AI.
4. Hypotension - The patient experienced hypotension, which has since resolved.
5. Chest pain - The patient initially presented with chest pain, but no further pain was reported.
6. ESRD on HD - The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for his ESRD.
7. Hemoptysis - The patient had hemoptysis, likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) with severe AI and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).
8. Desensitization - The patient underwent successful amp"
