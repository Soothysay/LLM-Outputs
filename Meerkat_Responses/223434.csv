   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**]
   post obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily, does not seem to have significant
   component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   .
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -hold off on BB as just weaned off levophed
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   .
   #Bandemia - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis likely also in
   part due to steroids.
   -f/u  urine, sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   .
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   .
   #Prophylaxis:SQH, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.
   .
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult will occur tomorrow.
   SW consult for today.  Continuing to address goals of care and patient
   requests.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider hospice depending on patient wishes.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure likely caused by post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient's recent events include being kept on BiPap overnight, a palliative care consult ordered but not available until Monday, becoming slightly more tachypnic overnight and improving with nebulization, being offered Ativan which she refused, tolerating 100% facemask for only 45 minutes with high SATs but complaining of discomfort and shortness of breath, so she was put back on BiPap.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 105/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving several treatments including antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), BiPap support, and nebulization. She has also been offered Ativan but declined.

The patient's physical examination shows that she is awake and alert, able to speak in three-word sentences, has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi over the right lung, and has multiple old surgical scars on her abdomen without tenderness. There is no significant edema noted in her extremities.

Laboratory results show"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**]
   post obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily, does not seem to have significant
   component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   .
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -hold off on BB as just weaned off levophed
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   .
   #Bandemia - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis likely also in
   part due to steroids.
   -f/u  urine, sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   .
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   .
   #Prophylaxis:SQH, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.
   .
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult will occur tomorrow.
   SW consult for today.  Continuing to address goals of care and patient
   requests.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider hospice depending on patient wishes.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 64 yo F with Stage III NSCLC with palliative
   stent, COPD, presents with hypoxemic resp failure, leukocytosis /
   bandemia, transient hypotension/pressor requirements, ARF, tachycardia
   with demand ischemia in setting of progressing lung mass and
   post-obstructive pna.  Remained on BiPAP overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.8 BP 105/64  HR 112  RR 17-30 with  97% sat on
   Bipap 15/5 60% O2 bleed. Obese F alert in NAD, appears comfortable on
   BiPAP, Bronchial BS, diffuse, coarse wheeze, RR tachy, obese soft + BS,
   trace edema
   Labs notable for VBG 7.36/55   WBC33.5 ( 39 )  HCT 30 , Cr 1.3 ( 1.7,
   b/l 0.8),  Trop 0.07
   CXR yesterday with large R hilar mass with post obstructive infiltrate,
   L mid zone hazy air space opacity
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive empiric broad antibx coverage
   (hx PSA, MRSA), f/u cx data. Too tenuous to tolerate bronch given resp
   status so have not been able to send sputum for cx and not
   expectorating sputum.  Continue BiPAP for comfort as is tolerating this
   well, nebs and prednisone 60 QD.  Morphine if needed for air hunger
   Leukocytosis remains elevated.  Complaining of dysuria--sending u/a and
   cx.  Will continue asa and lipitor.  Troponin plateaud and trending
   down.  ARF
cr is trending down slowly, elevation likely prerenal in
   setting of poor PO. Advance diet to clears/softs as tolerated with
   small breaks off PAP and will start gentel maintenace IVF.  Pt is
   DNR/DNI.  She has been refusing some meds including sq hep and
   pneumoboots.  Continue to address goals of care with pt and family.
   Palliative care c/s for Monday and SW consult.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, stage III non-small cell lung cancer, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is currently on BiPap support and has been treated with antibiotics for the suspected infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may worsen, leading to further difficulty in oxygenation.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing new infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and steroids, as well as from the invasive procedures.
3. Cardiac issues: There is a possibility of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure due to the patient's history of NSTEMI, demand ischemia, and the use of pressors.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate due to prerenal causes such as dehydration and sepsis.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and the current situation may exacerbate her mental health condition.
6. Allergic reactions: The patient has allergies to cefaclor and may have an increased risk of allergic reactions to other medications.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's lung cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia put her at risk for recurrent or worsening pneumonia.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure (systolic). He is currently in the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD and acute heart failure. The patient has been on BiPAP support and is also receiving various medications including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild hypothermia, and normal blood pressure. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, and there has been a significant fluid balance with an intake of 2,886 mL and output of 1,380 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of BiPAP with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 60%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, normal platelet count, elevated Cr, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and positive blood and urine cultures suggest a possible infection. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily, does not seem to have significant
   component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   .
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -hold off on BB as just weaned off levophed
   -lipitor 80mg daily

   #Bandemia - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis likely also in
   part due to steroids.
   -f/u  urine, sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   .
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds
   .
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   .
   #Prophylaxis:SQH, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, stage III non-small cell lung cancer, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She has a metal stent in place to open up the obstruction caused by the tumor and is currently receiving chemotherapy. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI and is most likely experiencing demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. She has been treated with antibiotics for a broad spectrum of bacteria, including MRSA and pseudomonas. The patient has shown improvement since admission but still requires respiratory support with BiPAP and supplemental oxygen. She is alert and awake, able to speak in short sentences, and has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi over the right lung. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,886 mL and output of 1,380 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,506 mL. Laboratory results indicate an increased white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and signs of acute renal failure. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and a palliative care consult will occur tomorrow. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This can result in tissue damage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure and has been receiving ventilatory support with BiPAP. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3Â°C (95.6Â°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/42 mmHg to 146/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP. The patient's physical examination revealed persistent and diffuse ronchi consistent with significant airway secretions. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, and elevated C-reactive protein levels. The patient's medical history includes COPD, lung cancer, and heart failure. She is currently on multiple medications including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Prednisone, Spiriva, and Aspirin. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to move towards hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which is a known complication of COPD and can be worsened by lung cancer. The presence of persistent airway secretions and elevated white blood cell count suggests an infectious component, which could further compromise respiratory"

   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on anbiotic therapy.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing some of these meds
   -decrease prednisone to 40 mg PO q daily, pt does not seem to have
   significant component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - IV solumedrol today to replace po prednisone b/c pt could not take po
   meds this am
   - continue bipap
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   -Follow palliative care recs regarding pain management
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis could also
   be in part due to steroids.  UCx negative
   f/u sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration. Cr improved
 1.0 today.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds.
   -Check vanco trough if renal function remains depressed.
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult complete.  SW consult
   for tomorrow to discuss financial issues (patient requested).
   Continuing to address goals of care and patient requests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, stage III non-small cell lung cancer, and multiple comorbidities. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn, Levofloxacin) for MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, and her condition seems to be improving. She has also been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Other potential medical complications include NSTEMI, elevated white blood cell count, hypotension, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which was likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She is responding to antibiotic therapy.
2. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has stage III non-small cell lung cancer and is currently receiving chemotherapy. There is a risk of disease progression and potential complications related to the tumor.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's presentation is consistent with NSTEMI, possibly secondary to demand ischemia caused by severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but have now decreased.
4. Elevated White Blood Cell Count: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to infection. Monitoring of WBC levels and follow-up sputum and blood cultures are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a known case of malignancy in the lung and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD and is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The patient tolerated BiPAP well, but desaturated to the low 80s while receiving nebulizers. Prednisone dosage was decreased to 40 mg daily. The patient's urine output is good. Beta-blocker administration was deferred due to the patient's severe COPD.

24-hour events include initiation and discontinuation of NIV, stool culture sent, and administration of multiple antibiotics. The patient has allergies to cefaclor and increased heart rate. The last doses of antibiotics given were levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Infusions and other ICU medications are mentioned, along with review of systems unchanged from admission except for diarrhea. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Assessment and plan include diarrhea, history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and heart failure (CHF), systolic, acute.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**]
   post obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on anbiotic therapy.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing some of these meds
   -decrease prednisone to 40 mg PO q daily, pt does not seem to have
   significant component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   -f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   -Follow palliative care recs regarding pain management
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   .
   #Bandemia - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis likely also in
   part due to steroids.
   -f/u  urine, sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   .
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds.  Check vanco trough if renal function remains
   depressed.
   .
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   .
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   .
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult today.  SW consult for
   today.  Continuing to address goals of care and patient requests.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider hospice depending on patient wishes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has shown improvement on antibiotic therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/83 mmHg to 150/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but they have a sinus tachycardia rhythm. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase in the lungs, obesity with multiple old surgical scars, no tenderness or bowel sounds in the abdomen, and no significant edema or cyanosis in the extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. The patient's renal function is slightly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia, non-small cell lung cancer with a metal stent in place to open up the obstruction"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo female with recurrent and now stage III lung Ca (NSCCA) and COPD
   now admit with post obstructive pneumonia.  She this morning is having
   worsening respiratory distress with increased tachypnea and inability
   to fully clear secretions.  She will need a combination of relief of
   respiratory discomfort and support of ventilation.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -BIPAP as tolerated
   -O2 as needed when BIPAP off
   -Concern is for worsening in the setting of inability to clear
   pneumonia with extensive malignancy
   -Levofloxacin for pneumonia
   -She is having worsening dyspnea in the setting of underlying disease
   making po intake difficult and may need to change to IV medications
   -Repeat CXR given clinical worsening
   COPD With Acute Exacerbation-
   -Predsnisone to 40mg/d
   -Continue with nebs on standing basis and PRN for worsening wheezing
   -BIPAP again may help support patient tolerance of treamtent
   -Zopinex/Atrovent
   -Change to IV steroid dosing
   Lung Cancer
   -Supportive care as above
   -Palliative care in to consult on possibilities for treatment going
   forward in regards to hospice

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of recurrent and stage III non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for post-obstructive pneumonia and is currently experiencing worsening respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes and diminished breath sounds in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and 1+ edema in both lower extremities. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin levels, along with decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). Imaging studies show no new findings on the chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient requires relief of respiratory discomfort and support of ventilation. She will be placed on BiPAP as tolerated, with supplemental oxygen as needed when BiPAP is off. Levofloxacin will be prescribed for pneumonia treatment.
2. COPD with Acute Exacerbation - Prednisone will be given at a dose of 40"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on anbiotic therapy.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex; although
   patient is refusing some of these meds
   -decrease prednisone to 40 mg PO q daily, pt does not seem to have
   significant component of COPD exacerbation given stable CO2
   - IV solumedrol today to replace po prednisone b/c pt could not take po
   meds this am
   - continue bipap
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission
   -Follow palliative care recs regarding pain management
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis could also
   be in part due to steroids.  UCx negative
   f/u sputum, blood cultures
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   #Hypotension - requiring levophed at the OSH which was weaned off on
   arrival to MICU.  Likely [**2-28**] sepsis given significant bandemia and post
   obstructive PNA.  No longer requiring Levophed.
   -gentle IVF if needed
   #Acute Renal Failure - likely prerenal given acute
   infection/dehydration. Cr improved
 1.0 today.
   -gently IVF (given report of EF 35% at OSH)
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose all meds.
   -Check vanco trough if renal function remains depressed.
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose)
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult complete.  SW consult
   for tomorrow to discuss financial issues (patient requested).
   Continuing to address goals of care and patient requests.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/74 mmHg to 91/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a bipap mask.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. She is also receiving chemotherapy for her non-small cell lung cancer.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, mild elevation in troponin T, and improvement in creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase on auscultation of the lungs, obesity with multiple old surgical scars, and no significant edema or clubbing or cyanosis in the extremities.

   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on anbiotic therapy but unable to be weaned from bipap.  Having some
   facial breakdown from bipap mask.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH.
   Unable to narrow antibiotic coverage b/c no cultures.
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h
   nebulizers today
   - keep IV solumedrol for now to replace po prednisone b/c pt could not
   take po meds yesterday am, want to be sure that steroids
   - continue bipap
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - to call pulmonologist today (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] to discuss whether primary
   problem endstage COPD v Lung CA/pneumonia
 may help re-direct goals of
   care
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission, not in town, currently
   covered by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
   [**Name (STitle) 2090**] Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] today to touch base regarding utility of chemo on
   [**12-17**] and options for other CA treatment.
   -Follow-up with  palliative care
s recs after today
s visit.
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis
   could also be in part due to steroids.  UCx negative,
   blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not producing)
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (patient refuses Heparin SC
 risks/benefits
   discussed w/patient), Famotidine, bowel reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care consult complete.  SW consult
   for tomorrow to discuss financial issues (patient requested).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to post obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Zosyn. She is also receiving morphine sulfate for discomfort and facemask oxygen therapy with bipap support.

The vital signs show a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/74 mmHg to 91/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The temperature is within normal range.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, able to speak in three-word sentences, and states she is breathing much better today. However, there are diffuse wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase in the lungs. No significant edema or clubbing or cyanosis is observed in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values such as potassium and magnesium are slightly below normal.

The patient's condition appears to be improving on antibiotic therapy, but she is still unable to be weaned from bipap support. The plan of care"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo female with lung cancer, COPD and post obstructive pneumonia all
   contributing to current respiratory decline and failiuire with need for
   BIPAP support intermittently.  We are working towards establishment of
   a stable regimen of support with non-invasive ventilatory support,
   continued antibiotics and use of bronchodilators and MSO4 for acute
   respiratory distress.  A goal would be to establish a support regimen
   that will allow her to move to a level of care independent of the ICU
   with home with hospice as a goal.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -BIPAP may be limited by severe hypoxemia and inability to deliver true
   high FIO2
will need continue NIV if oxygenation is a problem
   -Continue with antibiotics and bronchodilators at a maximum
   -MSO4 as needed for respiratory discomfort
   1.5)Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease-
   -Solumedrol IV to continue
   -Spiriva and all bronchodilators to continue
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Vanco/ZOsyn
   -Chest PT as tolerated and with stable WBC count and no fevers

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and requires intermittent support with bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, high blood pressure ranging from 117 to 140 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and low oxygen saturation at 83%. The patient's temperature is within the normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds and diminished breath sounds on both sides. The patient is overweight and obese. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly low platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, low magnesium, and high phosphorus. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a slightly alkalotic pH, normal carbon dioxide levels, low oxygen saturation, and normal bicarbonate levels. 

The patient's medical history includes lung cancer, COPD, heart failure (systolic), and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on anbiotic therapy but unable to be weaned from bipap.  Having some
   facial breakdown from bipap mask.
   -treat PNA broadly with [**Doctor Last Name **], Zosyn, Levo given significant bandemia,
   h/o MRSA and pseudomonas, and hypotension requiring pressors at OSH.
   Unable to narrow antibiotic coverage b/c no cultures.
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h
   nebulizers today
   - keep IV solumedrol for now to replace po prednisone b/c pt could not
   take po meds yesterday am, want to be sure that steroids
   - continue bipap
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] aware of admission
   - to call pulmonologist today (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] to discuss whether primary
   problem endstage COPD v Lung CA/pneumonia
 may help re-direct goals of
   care
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] emailed to notify of admission, not in town, currently
   covered by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
   [**Name (STitle) 2090**] Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] today to touch base regarding utility of chemo on
   [**12-17**] and options for other CA treatment.
   -Follow-up with  palliative care
s recs after today
s visit.
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis
   could also be in part due to steroids.  UCx negative,
   blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not producing)
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (patient refuses Heparin SC
 risks/benefits
   discussed w/patient), Famotidine, bowel reg if needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn and Levo. She is also receiving a regimen of inhaled medications and continuous nebulizers. The patient has facial breakdown from using the bipap mask. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains unable to be weaned from bipap. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation: The patient's inability to be weaned from bipap indicates a potential complication of prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, and her elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to treat this.
3. NSTEMI: The patient most likely experienced demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis, resulting in a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Cardiac enzymes are mildly elevated, but now decreased.
4. Elevated WBC: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to infection or steroid use. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics are being continued.
5. Depression: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure. He is currently in the ICU due to acute exacerbation of COPD and acute heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and pain management with morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system from cancer treatment and prolonged ICU stay. The ongoing antibiotic therapy suggests an existing or suspected infection.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's COPD exacerbation and heart failure may lead to respiratory distress. His low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95%) and use of BiPAP mask indicate respiratory support is necessary.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -400 mL, which could be indicative of dehydration or excessive fluid removal.
4. Bleeding risk: The elevated PT/INR value suggests an increased risk of bleeding. This is concerning, especially considering the patient's request to discontinue sc heparin.
5. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction. This could be related to the patient's overall condition or medication use.
6. Diarrhea and rash: The patient's diarrhea and rash may be side effects of medications or an"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia
   as seen on CXR.  ABG with significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on
   70% FIO2, representing shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving
   on antibiotic therapy but unable to be weaned from bipap.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin, however
   likely poor lung penetration due to mass obstruction
   - chest CT today to reassess
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h
   nebulizers today
   - continue with IV steroids for now
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - IP consult for possible re-stenting, photodynamic therapy for symptom
   relief
   - Radiation oncology consult for palliate radiation
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].
   - Chest CT today.
   -F/U radiation oncology recs
   - F/U IP recs
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] infection although leukocytosis
   could also be in part due to steroids.  UCx negative,
   blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not producing)
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC, f/u cultures
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: SC heparin
 pt is willing to take now, Famotidine, bowel
   reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care and SW following.  Continuing
   to address goals of care and patient requests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of COPD, heart failure (CHF), and acute systolic dysfunction. The patient's medical team consulted with palliative care, oncology, and radiation oncology regarding possible treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his right lung. The patient requested discontinuation of heparin and increased the dose of morphine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of COPD and current acute exacerbation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to compromised lung function and potential aspiration.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
3. Stress Ulcer: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to the stress of illness and the use of corticosteroids.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can be a serious complication.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia, indicating an elevated heart rate. This, along with the presence of heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo female with COPD and Lung CA now with persistent and signficiant
   respiratory compromise in the setting of post obstructive pneumonia.
   She has undergone continued support with BIPAP and O2 but has been slow
   to clear her secreations and need for increased local therapies to
   faciliate dyspnea and resolution of pneumonia.   The plans being
   purused will all have to be weighed against the relative risks as has
   been documented prior.  Certainly XRT should be considered but there
   does exist a significant risk of both worsening edema and obstruction
   and current dosing will have to be considered with radiation oncology.
   In addition, patient has sufficient respiratory distress and hypoxemia
   which would make any local therapy directed by Interventional Pulmonary
   difficult without intubation and prolonged respiratory failure without
   a reasonable expectation for extubation based upon clinical worsening.
   In addition, patient has very difficult anatomy for local stent therapy
   which has been raised as well.  In summary
we will continue to work to
   evaluate for any possible additional palliative interventions that are
   available but current course of support with intermittent BIPAP and O2
   and medications to relive patient discomfort.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She is experiencing persistent respiratory distress and requires support with BIPAP and oxygen. The patient has been slow to clear her secretions and needs increased local therapies to facilitate dyspnea and resolution of pneumonia. There are concerns about the risks of further interventions, including radiation therapy and interventional pulmonary procedures due to her respiratory distress and hypoxemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's persistent respiratory compromise and slow clearance of secretions indicate a risk of continued respiratory distress.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 level of 91% suggests significant hypoxemia, which could lead to further complications if not adequately managed.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count raises the possibility of an ongoing infection, which may require appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest post-obstructive pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening of respiratory status.
5. Edema and obstruction: Radiation therapy could worsen edema and obstruction in the patient's case, considering her difficult anatomy for local stent therapy.
6. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of diuretics indicate a risk of exacerbation, especially with ongoing fluid balance issues"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo female with COPD and Lung CA now with persistent and signficiant
   respiratory compromise in the setting of post obstructive pneumonia.
   She has undergone continued support with BIPAP and O2 but has been slow
   to clear her secreations and need for increased local therapies to
   faciliate dyspnea and resolution of pneumonia.   The plans being
   purused will all have to be weighed against the relative risks as has
   been documented prior.  Certainly XRT should be considered but there
   does exist a significant risk of both worsening edema and obstruction
   and current dosing will have to be considered with radiation oncology.
   In addition, patient has sufficient respiratory distress and hypoxemia
   which would make any local therapy directed by Interventional Pulmonary
   difficult without intubation and prolonged respiratory failure without
   a reasonable expectation for extubation based upon clinical worsening.
   In addition, patient has very difficult anatomy for local stent therapy
   which has been raised as well.  In summary
we will continue to work to
   evaluate for any possible additional palliative interventions that are
   available but current course of support with intermittent BIPAP and O2
   and medications to relive patient discomfort.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Will review CT scan with IP, Rad Onc, Primary Oncology
   -Will optimize palliative support with BIPAP and O2
   -NO offer of chemotherapy from oncology in this setting of critical
   illness which makese perfect sense
   -Suction as needed
   -Continue antibiotics for post obstructive pneumonia

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and lung cancer who is currently in the ICU for persistent respiratory compromise. She has been on BIPAP support and oxygen but has been slow to clear her secretions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. Her blood work reveals an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows an increase in right-sided mass based on the repeat CT scan, which will require a formal radiology read. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia, and further evaluation with CT scan, radiation oncology, and interventional pulmonology is planned. The patient's current course of support includes intermittent BIPAP and O2, medications for discomfort, suctioning as needed, continuation of antibiotics, and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to persistent respiratory compromise and post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Worsening edema and obstruction from radiation therapy.
3. Prolonged respiratory failure without reasonable expectation for extubation.
4. Difficulty in local stent therapy due to difficult anatomy.
5. Infection or sepsis secondary to the elevated white blood cell count.
6. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
7. Heart failure (CHF),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and heart failure. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory compromise due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She requires continued support with BiPAP and O2 but has been slow to clear her secretions. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's condition indicates a post-obstructive pneumonia, which can lead to further complications if not adequately treated.
2. Respiratory failure: Given the persistent respiratory compromise, there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if additional interventions are needed.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the lower extremities.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition may predispose her to stress ulcers, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of heart failure puts her at risk for exacerbations, especially if there is fluid overload or inadequate cardiac function.
7. Infection: With multiple lines and tubes in place, the patient is susceptible to additional infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)"

   CT chest & abdomen Impression:
   1. Worsening disease in the right lung with enlarging tumor causing new
   marked narrowing and obstruction of multiple right bronchi, as well as
   multiple enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes.
   2. New ground glass and more consolidative opacities in the right upper
   lobe, right lower lobe, and to a lesser degree left lower lobe that
   suggest postobstructive multifocal pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan.  She has
   made relatively little progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been
   afebrile throughout her hospital stay.  Rad onc consulted regarding
   potential XRT of tumor, but they do not feel that she can receive any
   more radiation to that area.  IP consulted regarding possible
   interventions, but they do not feel she is a candidate for further
   stenting or other interventions based on chest CT.  Team has been in
   e-mail contact with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] regarding her status and
   possibility of further treatment.  After discussing these consults and
   the results of the chest CT, the patient
s primary goals now are for
   comfort.  Will have palliative care see the patient again today to help
   determine how best we can meet her personal goals.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin; likely poor
   lung penetration due to mass obstruction, though may decompensate more
   quickly if antibiotics are withdrawn
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h nebs
   - continue with IV steroids for now
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].  Discussing chemo options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**], but further

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. Despite antibiotic therapy, she has made little progress and remains afebrile throughout her hospital stay. The patient is not eligible for further radiation therapy or stenting interventions. The team has been in contact with her oncologist regarding her status and the possibility of further treatment. The patient's primary goals now are for comfort, and palliative care will be involved in determining how best to meet her personal goals. The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, home respiratory regimen, IV steroids, bipap or face mask as tolerated, and assessing patient comfort as a goal of treatment. Morphine may be used to relieve air hunger as needed. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI, elevated WBC count, depression, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and palliative care and social work will continue to address goals of care and patient requests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further deterioration in her respiratory function due to the enlarged tumor causing obstruction of multiple right bronchi and post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD, stage III non-small cell lung cancer, and undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving treatment for her lung cancer. The patient is also being treated for NSTEMI, elevated WBC count, and depression. She has a code status of DNR/DNI and is being followed by palliative care and social work. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the obstruction caused by the tumor continues or if there is a progression of the pneumonia.
2. Infection: Given the patient's history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, there is a risk of infection, especially if the antibiotics are not effective or if the patient develops resistance to them.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac condition may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as heart attack or heart failure.
4. Elevated WBC Count: The persistent leukocytosis indicates ongoing inflammation or infection, which needs to be monitored and addressed to prevent any potential complications.
5. Lung Cancer Progression: The patient's lung cancer may progress despite chemotherapy, leading to worsening symptoms and potential complications.
6. Depression: The patient's depression should be managed appropriately to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy as an outpatient. The patient's condition seems to be improving on antibiotic therapy, but she is unable to be weaned from bipap. The assessment and plan include continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, performing a chest CT to reassess, and continuing with home regimen of Advair, Spiriva, Xopenex, and IV steroids. The patient also has a metal stent in place to open up the obstruction caused by the tumor and is scheduled for next chemotherapy on 12-17. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
3. Non-small cell lung cancer with a metal stent in place to open up the obstruction caused by the tumor.
4. NSTEMI (non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis.

   1. Worsening disease in the right lung with enlarging tumor causing new
   marked narrowing and obstruction of multiple right bronchi, as well as
   multiple enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes.
   2. New ground glass and more consolidative opacities in the right upper
   lobe, right lower lobe, and to a lesser degree left lower lobe that
   suggest postobstructive multifocal pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor and  post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CXR.  ABG with
   significant AA gradient given PaO2 of 64 on 70% FIO2, representing
   shunt physiology.  Patient seems to be improving on antibiotic therapy
   but unable to be weaned from bipap.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin, however
   likely poor lung penetration due to mass obstruction
   - chest CT today to reassess
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h
   nebulizers today
   - continue with IV steroids for now
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   - IP consult for possible re-stenting, photodynamic therapy for symptom
   relief

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. Her current condition is improving on antibiotic therapy but she is unable to be weaned from bipap. The patient also has a metal stent in place to open up the obstruction caused by the tumor and is undergoing chemotherapy. She is due for her next chemotherapy session on 12-17. There are concerns about potential complications such as NSTEMI, elevated WBC count, and depression. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and palliative care and social work consultation are being followed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient may be at risk for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes are mildly elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
2. Elevated WBC count: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an ongoing infection. This could be due to the underlying lung cancer, pneumonia, or the use of steroids.
3. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, which may require ongoing management and support from a social worker or palliative care team.
4. Respiratory failure: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan.  She has
   made relatively little progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been
   afebrile throughout her hospital stay.  Rad onc consulted regarding
   potential XRT of tumor, but they do not feel that she can receive any
   more radiation to that area.  IP consulted regarding possible
   interventions, but they do not feel she is a candidate for further
   stenting or other interventions based on chest CT.  Team has been in
   e-mail contact with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] regarding her status and
   possibility of further treatment.  After discussing these consults and
   the results of the chest CT, the patient
s primary goals now are for
   comfort.  Palliative care team on board.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin; likely poor
   lung penetration due to mass obstruction, though may decompensate more
   quickly if antibiotics are withdrawn
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h nebs
   - continue with IV steroids for now as pt has been on and off bipap
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].  Discussing chemo options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**], but further
   therapy may not be an option for her given her advanced state.
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] steroids vs. infection.  UCx
   negative, blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not
   producing).  Pt now having diarrhea.
   -emperically treat with IV Flagyl for C. Diff.
   - continue to trend WBCs and monitor cultures for infection
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: SC heparin
 pt is willing to take now, Famotidine, bowel
   reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care and SW following.  Continuing
   to address goals of care and patient requests.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to an obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient has made little progress. The oncology team consulted regarding radiation therapy, but the patient is not a candidate for further radiation. The palliative care team has been involved, and the patient's primary goal now is comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung tumor may continue to expand, leading to worsening respiratory failure. The use of bipap or face mask may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Empirical treatment with IV Flagyl for Clostridium difficile has been initiated, and cultures are pending. Monitoring the patient's trend in white blood cell count and reviewing culture results is important.

3. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for her lung cancer. Further chemotherapy sessions are planned, but the feasibility of additional treatment may depend on her advanced state.

4. NSTEMI: The patient likely experienced demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but have since decreased.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan.  She has
   made relatively little progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been
   afebrile throughout her hospital stay.  Rad onc consulted regarding
   potential XRT of tumor, but they do not feel that she can receive any
   more radiation to that area.  IP consulted regarding possible
   interventions, but they do not feel she is a candidate for further
   stenting or other interventions based on chest CT.  Team has been in
   e-mail contact with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] regarding her status and
   possibility of further treatment.  After discussing these consults and
   the results of the chest CT, the patient
s primary goals now are for
   comfort.  Will have palliative care see the patient again today to help
   determine how best we can meet her personal goals.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin; likely poor
   lung penetration due to mass obstruction, though may decompensate more
   quickly if antibiotics are withdrawn
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h nebs
   - continue with IV steroids for now
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].  Discussing chemo options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**], but further
   therapy may not be an option for her given her advanced state.
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] steroids vs. infection.  UCx
   negative, blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not
   producing)
   -antibiotics as above
   -monitor WBC, f/u cultures
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: SC heparin
 pt is willing to take now, Famotidine, bowel
   reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Start maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care and SW following.  Continuing
   to address goals of care and patient requests.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to an expansion of an underlying lung tumor rather than post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics but has shown little progress. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels, which is likely due to the expansion of her lung tumor. Despite antibiotic therapy, she has made relatively little progress.

2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has stage III non-small cell lung cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. There may be a metal stent in place to open up an obstruction caused by the tumor.

3. NSTEMI: The patient most likely experienced demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but have now decreased.

4. Elevated WBC: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to steroids or an infection. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been prescribed.

5. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with Zoloft and Effexor, and a social worker consult has been requested.

6. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic medications including SC heparin for DVT, Famot"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and she has been on non-invasive ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 104 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 126/72 mmHg to 155/108 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 90%. The patient's temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent) is within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and the presence of obesity and abdominal distension.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) level is slightly elevated. Troponin-T is within normal range. The patient's electrolyte levels, including sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), and magnesium (Mg), are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are also within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes lung cancer, malignant neoplasm, and COPD. The assessment and plan include RASH (possibly related to medication), diarrhea, heart failure (acute systolic),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress post obstructive pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring non-invasive ventilation and extensive medical interventions. Despite these efforts, the patient's respiratory compromise persists. Radiation oncology and interventional pulmonology have evaluated the patient but no further specific palliative interventions are available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory compromise and desire to avoid intubation or mechanical ventilation put her at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and supportive care, such as non-invasive ventilation, will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis indicates a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, including fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status, should be performed. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection should be considered given the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of systolic heart failure needs to be taken into consideration when managing her respiratory status and fluid balance. Careful attention should be given to maintaining adequate cardiac output and preventing fluid overload.
4. Cancer Progression: The patient's recurrent lung cancer may continue to worsen and cause further respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory distress post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and subsequently required intubation. The patient's allergies include cefaclor, and they have been receiving various antibiotics including levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. The patient is currently on low-dose morphine and continues to receive fluids and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (104 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 126/72 to 155/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and they have sinus rhythm. 

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula and CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 925 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 70%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 118 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the chest and normal heart sounds. Other systems are not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and post-obstructive pneumonia, leading to persistent respiratory compromise. The patient's goals are to avoid pain and dyspnea, and she has declined intubation or mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress, COPD exacerbation, and post-obstructive pneumonia, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's current pneumonia may progress and result in sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has been diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure. If not managed appropriately, this condition may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and compromised cardiac function.

4. Cancer progression: The patient has a history of lung cancer, which may continue to progress despite ongoing treatment. This could lead to additional complications and limitations in management options.

5. Complications related to invasive procedures: As the patient is in the ICU, she may require invasive procedures such as central venous catheterization, arterial catheterization, or mechanical ventilation. These procedures carry their own risks of complications, including infection, bleeding, and damage to"

   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure - likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan.  She has
   made relatively little progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been
   afebrile throughout her hospital stay.  Rad onc consulted regarding
   potential XRT of tumor, but they do not feel that she can receive any
   more radiation to that area.  IP consulted regarding possible
   interventions, but they do not feel she is a candidate for further
   stenting or other interventions based on chest CT.  Team has been in
   e-mail contact with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] regarding her status and
   possibility of further treatment.  After discussing these consults and
   the results of the chest CT, the patient
s primary goals now are for
   comfort.  Palliative care team on board.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin; likely poor
   lung penetration due to mass obstruction, though may decompensate more
   quickly if antibiotics are withdrawn
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h nebs
   - continue with IV steroids for now as pt has been on and off bipap
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; can use
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].  Discussing chemo options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**], but further
   therapy may not be an option for her given her advanced state.

   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to expansion of the underlying lung tumor rather than post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has not made significant progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been afebrile throughout her hospital stay. Radiation oncology and interventional pulmonology consultations were discussed, but the patient is not a candidate for further radiation or stenting interventions. The primary goals now are for comfort, with palliative care provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung tumor may continue to cause obstruction, leading to recurrent episodes of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile, the patient has an elevated WBC count, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for infection.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient may have had an NSTEMI due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but have now decreased. Continued monitoring and management of CAD risk factors are necessary.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, and empirical treatment with IV Flagyl for C. Diff should be continued.
5. Depression: The patient is being treated with Z"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient has made little progress and has been afebrile throughout her hospital stay. The patient underwent stenting to open up an obstruction caused by the tumor and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. However, further therapy may not be an option for her given her advanced state.

The patient's current goals are for comfort, and the palliative care team is involved. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin) due to poor lung penetration caused by the mass obstruction. She is also on home medications such as Advair, Spiriva, Xopenex, and nebulized albuterol every 4 hours. IV steroids are being continued for now as the patient has been on and off bipap. Bipap or face mask use is continued as tolerated. Morphine is being used to relieve air hunger as needed.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and palliative care and social work support are being provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1930**] is a 64 yo F with PMH of COPD, stage III non small
   cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy outpatient who presented with
   hypoxic respiratory failure likely [**2-28**] post obstructive pneumonia.
   Patient with a Hx of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure
 Patient is now BiPAP dependent.
   Worsening respiratory status likely [**2-28**] expansion of underlying lung
   tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan.  She has
   made relatively little progress despite antibiotic therapy and has been
   afebrile throughout her hospital stay.  Rad onc consulted regarding
   potential XRT of tumor, but they do not feel that she can receive any
   more radiation to that area.  IP consulted regarding possible
   interventions, but they do not feel she is a candidate for further
   stenting or other interventions based on chest CT.  Team has been in
   e-mail contact with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] regarding her status and
   possibility of further treatment.  After discussing these consults and
   the results of the chest CT, the patient
s primary goals now are for
   comfort.  Palliative care team on board.
   -continue broad spectrum abx Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin; likely poor
   lung penetration due to mass obstruction, though may decompensate more
   quickly if antibiotics are withdrawn
   -continue with home regimen of advair, spiriva, xopenex,  Q4h nebs
   - continue with IV steroids for now as pt has been on and off bipap
   - continue bipap or face mask as tolerated
   - continue to assess patient comfort as a goal of treatment; titrate up
   morphine to relieve air hunger as needed
   - f/u blood cx
   #Non-small cell lung ca - she has metal stent in place to open up
   obstruction caused by the tumor.  Getting chemo currently, due for next
   chemo [**12-17**].  Discussing chemo options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**], but further
   therapy may not be an option for her given her advanced state.
   .
   #NSTEMI - most likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   hypoxia and early sepsis.   Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated at 0.21,
   now decreased.
   -ASA 325mg
   -Continue atorvastatin
   -hold off on BB, given hypotension and COPD
   -lipitor 80mg daily
   #Elevated WBC  - stable. likely [**2-28**] steroids vs. infection.  UCx
   negative, blood cultures pending, sputum not available (pt not
   producing).  Pt was having diarrhea, now resolved.  Will wait to add
   flagyl if diarrhea resumes or stool + C. diff.
   - continue to trend WBCs and monitor cultures for infection
   #Depression
 continue Zoloft and effexor (renally dose).
   - SW consult as per patient request/palliative care recommendations.
   #Prophylaxis: SC heparin
 pt is willing to take now, Famotidine, bowel
   reg if needed
   #FEN: IVF if unable to tolerate POs due to mask.  Continue maintenance
   fluids.
   #Code Status: DNR/DNI.  Palliative care and SW following.  Continuing
   to address goals of care and patient requests.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition includes being BiPAP dependent and experiencing worsening respiratory status likely due to expansion of underlying lung tumor more than post obstructive pneumonia as seen on CT scan. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient has made relatively little progress and has been afebrile throughout her hospital stay. Radiation oncology and interventional pulmonology consultations have been discussed, but the patient is not a candidate for further radiation or stenting interventions based on chest CT.

The primary goals for the patient's comfort have been established, including continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, home respiratory regimen, IV steroids, BiPAP, and titrating up morphine to relieve air hunger as needed. The patient is also due for her next chemotherapy session on [**12-17**], but further therapy may not be an option given her advanced state.

Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated but have now decreased. The patient is currently taking ASA 325mg, atorvastatin, and lipitor 80mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of COPD and stage III non-small cell lung cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to post obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. She has been on BiPAP support and made little progress despite antibiotic therapy. The underlying lung tumor has likely expanded more than the post obstructive pneumonia, as seen on the CT scan. Radiation therapy is not recommended due to the location of the tumor. The patient's primary goals now are for comfort, and the palliative care team is on board. The patient will continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics, home respiratory regimen, IV steroids, and BiPAP as tolerated. Morphine will be titrated to relieve air hunger as needed. Blood cultures will be followed up, and the patient's comfort will be continuously assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on BiPAP support, indicating a significant respiratory compromise. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count and is receiving empirical antibiotic therapy for a suspected infection. There is a risk of developing healthcare-associated pneumonia or other infections while in the ICU.
3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient had an NSTEMI, likely caused by demand ischemia in the setting of severe hypoxia and early sepsis. There is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure. She presented with respiratory distress and required non-invasive ventilation support. The patient has been evaluated by radiation oncology and interventional pulmonary specialists, with no further specific palliative interventions available. Her goals are to avoid pain, dyspnea, and intubation/mechanical ventilation, while preferring to be supported at home if possible.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's respiratory distress and progressive tumor size with post-obstructive pneumonia may lead to further respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient is currently afebrile, there is a risk of developing or worsening pneumonia due to her compromised respiratory status. Antibiotic therapy should be continued as per the treatment plan.
3. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the acute exacerbation caused by the lung cancer and pneumonia. Continued use of steroids, nebs, and non-invasive ventilatory support will help manage this condition.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure needs close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent exacerbation.
5. Leukocytosis: The rising leukocyte count indicates an ongoing inflammatory response. Repeat C. diff testing and initiation of Flagyl are important to address any potential infections.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who is experiencing respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on non-invasive ventilation support. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/81 mmHg to 157/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 91%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, end-expiratory rounding, obesity, and distended abdomen. Neurologically, the patient is alert and conversant.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and platelet count within normal range. Kidney function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes malignant neoplasm of the lung, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute heart failure. The patient has stated clear goals of wanting to avoid pain and dyspnea, and does not want intubation or mechanical ventilation. She desires to be supported at home if possible, but will continue with full support in the ICU for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, and further deterioration of heart failure symptoms. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with advanced lung cancer who is experiencing respiratory distress. She has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and required BiPAP overnight. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with acute exacerbation. Additionally, she has heart failure (systolic) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for BiPAP suggest a potential risk of respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by her underlying COPD and lung cancer.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of post-obstructive pneumonia indicates a risk of developing pneumonia, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory status.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, which may indicate fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.

4. Infection: The rising leukocyte count suggests an ongoing infection, which needs to be addressed and treated promptly to prevent further complications.

5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea could be caused by an infection or medication side effects. If not managed properly, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of systolic heart failure increases the risk of exacerbation, particularly in the setting of respiratory distress and"
