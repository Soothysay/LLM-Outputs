","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old individual with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation, and multiple comorbidities. They were admitted to the ICU for pericardiocentesis due to cardiac tamponade. The patient's current condition includes ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fluid balance concerns, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and history of cardiac tamponade indicate a potential for ongoing cardiac complications. Close monitoring and rate control measures are necessary.
2. Fluid Balance Issues: The patient has a negative fluid balance, suggesting ongoing fluid losses. This may require careful management to avoid hypovolemia or dehydration.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Further evaluation and management of this condition are needed to address the underlying cause and improve oxygen carrying capacity.
4. Medication Reconciliation: The patient's complex medication regimen needs careful evaluation and reconciliation to ensure accuracy and minimize potential drug interactions or adverse effects.
5. Infection Risk: Given the prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures, the patient is at an increased risk of developing healthcare-associated infections. Infection control measures and vigilant monitoring for signs of infection are essential.
6. Renal Function Monitoring: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension (HTN), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was recently started on methotrexate (MTX) treatment for RA. The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and a pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which showed equalization of pressures and removal of 300 cc of clear fluid. The fluid analysis indicated an exudative effusion with low glucose levels. Rheumatology consultation suggested a likely RA-related effusion. MTX was temporarily held, and the patient was started on plaquenil. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 140/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is comfortable in bed and has no acute distress. Physical examination findings include sclera anicteric, moist mucous membranes, supple neck with jugular venous distention (JVD) to the earlobe at a 45-degree head-of-bed (HOB) elevation, decreased breath sounds in the lungs, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs,"

   put out brown fluid at at least 10 cc/hr. Although patient with
   tachycardia, elevated JVP, unlikely to be tamponade because pulsus has
   normalized so quickly. Dramatically low glucose most consistent with RA

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and pericardial effusion. He was recently started on methotrexate (MTX) for his RA. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of pericardial effusion and tamponade, which was confirmed by an echocardiogram (TTE). He underwent pericardiocentesis and drain placement. The patient's rhythm initially returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but then transitioned into atrial flutter (AFLUTTER) and later back into AFib. He was resistant to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and amiodarone. His glucose levels were dramatically low, most likely due to his RA. The patient's current medications include Prednisone, amiodarone, diltiazem, aspirin, and Advair. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.7°C. His physical examination reveals crackles at the left base and diffuse wheezes on lung auscultation, trace lower extremity edema, and radial and digital pulses 2+ and well perfused extremities. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose levels. The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of his rhythm, pericardial effusion, and fluid status. He will continue on amiodarone and diltiazem drips, and his drain will be pulled as previously discussed. The patient's other medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and rheumatoid arthritis, are being managed accordingly. The patient's disposition is pending further improvement in his pericardial effusion and rhythm control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation (AF) and pericardial effusion. The patient recently started on methotrexate (MTX) for RA. He underwent pericardiocentesis and drain placement due to the effusion. The patient's glucose levels were dramatically low, suggesting that RA might be the cause of the effusion. The drain was removed on [**2102-5-27**]. The patient's rhythm has been in and out of AF, currently in sinus rhythm. His CHADS2 score is 3, indicating a moderate risk for stroke.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient had a significant pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade, which required pericardiocentesis and drain placement. Although the drain was removed, there is still some residual effusion present.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which has been resistant to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and amiodarone during this hospital course. It is unclear if the patient was in AF at home since he is asymptomatic. The patient's CHADS2 score indicates a moderate risk for stroke, and anticoag"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with an admission weight of 111.6 kg, currently resting comfortably in bed without acute distress. The patient has a history of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Notable findings include decreased breath sounds, right-sided radial and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+, lower extremity edema to knees bilaterally, and intact cranial nerves II-XII with normal strength in upper and lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade if not managed properly. This can cause decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, indicating anemia. This may contribute to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient has diffuse expiratory wheezes and decreased breath sounds. These findings suggest possible respiratory compromise or obstruction, which may require intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's labs show abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium (K+), low magnesium (Mg++), and normal calcium (Ca++). These imbalances can affect cardiac function and muscle activity.
5. Potential infections: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts on multiple occasions, suggesting a"

   71M with RA recently started on MTX, HTN, IDDM, COPD with new diagnosis
   atrial fibrillation and pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis
   and drain placement c/b Aflutter
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion: R heart cath showed equalization of pressures
   as documented above. Improved pressure in pericardium post drain
   placement, but TTE showed some residual effusion. Drain continues to
   put out brown fluid at at least 10 cc/hr. Although patient with
   tachycardia, elevated JVP, unlikely to be tamponade because pulsus has
   normalized so quickly. Dramatically low glucose most consistent with RA
   as etiology of effusion.
   - Pull drain when output decreases
   - f/u  fluid cultures
   - Recheck Pulsus later today
   - Recheck TTE to document effusion improvement.
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation at PCP's office on day
   of admission. Was in NSR last night and went into Afib and now
   transitioned into A flutter. Resistant to betablockers, CCBs, and
   amiodarone. Most likely SVT due to irritation from pericardial drain.
   No improvement with IVF resusication so unlikely to be due to
   dehydration. CHADS2 score is 3 (hypertension, age, DMII) and although
   patient has been in and out of rhythm while in house, it is unclear if
   patient was in SVT at home since he is asymptomatic
   - Pull drain as above
   - Continue amiodarone and diltiazem gtt
   - Continue aspirin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - If remains in SVT, plan for TEE and cardioversion on Monday. EP
   aware.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  No history of CAD.
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   #. PUMP:  No history of diastolic or systolic dysfunction. If effusion
   progresses to tamponade patient can manifest symptoms of heart failure,
   such as pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema..
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Antihypertensive regimen not known. Hold off on
   antihypertensive therapy at this time so as not to mask BP changes
   secondary to tamponade. Patient not hypertensive. Home medications
   include Verapamil, Benicar, and Mazide.
   - Continue CCB and Amiodarone as above
   .
   # DL: Restarted home dose of statin last night.
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthrtitis: Appears stable at this time. Holding MTX per
   Rheum. Will d/w Rheum re: restarting prednisone and consideration of
   plaquenil.
   - F/u Rheum reccs
   - follow up [**Doctor First Name **] and ccp
   - Tylenol prn for pain control
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 1.6 > 1.2. Improvement likely due
   to better forward flow s/p pericardiocentesis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient presented to the hospital with a pericardial effusion and was found to have equalization of pressures as documented above. Following pericardiocentesis and drain placement, the patient's pericardium pressure improved, but there is still some residual effusion. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial flutter and resistant AFib, resistant to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tamponade: Although the patient's pulsus has normalized quickly, there is still a concern for tamponade due to the ongoing production of brown fluid at 10 cc/hr from the drain. The plan is to pull the drain when the output decreases, recheck the pulsus later today, and recheck the trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to document effusion improvement.

2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has been diagnosed with AFib and is currently in atrial flutter. The rhythm disturbances have been resistant to multiple medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and"
