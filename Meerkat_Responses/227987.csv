","The patient is a 72-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis following the ingestion of a wild mushroom, specifically amanita ocreata. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have rapidly trended up, indicating liver damage. Synthetic function is worsening, but there is no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient is currently being treated with activated charcoal, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and penicillin to address the mushroom poisoning. She is also receiving cimetidine and milk thistle to support liver health. The patient's coagulation profile and mental status are being monitored closely.

The patient's medical history includes ischemic heart disease and cardiac insufficiency, but she has not established care in the US. She reports experiencing chest pain daily, lasting for 30 minutes, and takes medications from Ukraine for these episodes. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 146/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress.

Physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, with no signs of edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis following wild mushroom ingestion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/73 to 132/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), but synthetic function is preserved. There are no signs of coagulopathy or renal dysfunction.

The patient has been started on cimetidine, milk thistle, and activated charcoal for mushroom toxicity. Mucomyst has been administered to support liver function. Penicillin G potassium has been given due to suspected bacterial infection. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's chest pain is not indicative of an acute or prior ischemic event, so aspirin has been considered. The patient's hypertension is being managed with hydralazine as needed. The patient's fasting status is NPO, and electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected. A transplant surgery consult has been obtained, and hepatitis serologies have been ordered to evaluate for underlying chronic liver disease in case a liver transplant is required.

The patient's acid-base balance is within normal limits, making diabetic ketoacidosis unlikely. An ECHO has been ordered"

","The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of acute severe hepatitis, possibly due to Amanita ocreata mushroom ingestion. She has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several procedures, including ERCP and placement of a nasobiliary drain. The patient's synthetic function appears to be improving, but her liver function tests (LFTs) are still elevated. She has also been started on silibinin infusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can occur due to severe liver dysfunction and can present with altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/INR suggests a risk for bleeding due to impaired blood clotting.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count indicates a potential risk for bleeding or bruising.
4. Chest pain and EKG changes: The patient's EKG shows strain patterns, which may indicate underlying cardiac issues that need further evaluation.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is not currently on home medications for it.
6. Hypernatremia: The high sodium level may require careful monitoring and management.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with only sips allowed, which can lead to malnutrition if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stabilizing, but close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman with acute hepatitis caused by mushroom ingestion. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable with improving synthetic function and no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and she is off penicillin G and cimetidine as she is now on milk thistle IV. She is undergoing transplant work-up, and her mental status is being monitored. The patient also has chest pain with EKG findings suggestive of strain, so a CT angiography of the coronaries has been ordered. She is not on home medications for hypertension, and it is recommended to consider starting a beta-blocker once stable. The patient is hypernatremic, and IV fluids are being changed to D5W 1/2 NS. She is NPO with sips and is waiting for guidance from the liver team regarding advancement of diet. Her electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted. She has a history of pneumoboots and has full code status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman who presented with acute hepatitis after ingesting wild mushrooms. Her liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated on admission but have now stabilized and started to trend down. Synthetic function is also improving, and there is no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. She has been placed on milk thistle IV and completed a course of mucomyst. The patient is now off penicillin G and cimetidine as she is on milk thistle. A nasobiliary drain was attempted but unable to be placed due to fragile ampullary anatomy. Silibinin infusion has been started, and the patient is being monitored for flushing, rash, and maintaining adequate hydration during the infusion. An IND and consent for silibinin have been documented.

The patient also has chest pain with EKG findings suggestive of strain, including ST depressions and elevations. A cardiac work-up is recommended, including a CT coronary angiography. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it is suggested to consider starting a beta-blocker once stable. Hypernatremia is present, and IV fluids should be changed to D5W 1/2 NS. The patient is NPO with sips and is awaiting dietary advancement from the liver team. Electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted as necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's acute hepatitis and elevated LFTs indicate severe"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman who was admitted with acute hepatitis after ingesting wild mushrooms. Her liver function tests (LFTs) have trended up initially but are now starting to trend down, indicating improvement in liver function. Synthetic function is also improving, and there is no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status, LFTs, and coagulation parameters will be monitored every 8 hours. She is receiving milk thistle IV and has completed a course of mucomyst. The patient is off penicillin G and cimetidine as she is now on milk thistle. A nasobiliary drain is needed for the liver. Antiemetics will be provided as needed. The patient is undergoing a transplant work-up. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although currently absent, this complication may arise due to ongoing liver dysfunction.
2. Hepatic failure: The patient's initial presentation was hepatic failure, and while her condition is improving, it remains a potential complication.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, she is at risk of developing infections.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT indicate a risk of bleeding due to impaired coagulation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and if not controlled, could lead to complications such as hypertensive emergency or organ damage.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with hepatic failure and amanita poisoning. They have been admitted to the ICU and are showing signs of multiorgan dysfunction. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with regular updates on vital signs, lab results, and medication administration. The patient's blood pressure is high, and there is mild RUQ tenderness in the abdomen. Neurological examination shows no asterixis, indicating no signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's liver enzymes are significantly elevated, and bilirubin levels are rising slowly. Transplant surgery has been made aware of the patient's condition, and pre-transplant evaluation has begun.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's hepatic failure, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as changes in mental status, confusion, and altered levels of consciousness.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure increases the risk of infections, including bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
3. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying liver disease.
4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR indicates a bleeding risk due to impaired liver synthesis of clotting factors.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent complications such as cardiovascular events or stroke.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hepatic failure and amanita poisoning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/74 mmHg to 175/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PTT and INR), and elevated lactate levels. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count and slightly low platelet count. The kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of chocolate flavor allergy and has received penicillin G potassium. They are currently receiving multiple IV medications, including silibilinum, cimetidine, and nitroglycerin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's hepatic failure, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and confusion.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased sputum production, would be important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman admitted with acute severe hepatitis after ingesting wild mushrooms. She has no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and her liver function tests (LFTs) initially trended up but now appear to be stabilizing. The patient underwent failed ERCP-guided nasobiliary drain placement on [11-20] and tolerated a test dose of silibinin. Her total bilirubin level is rising, which may be due to manipulation of the ampulla during the procedure or lagging behind the rise in AST/ALT levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although the patient currently shows no signs of hepatic encephalopathy, it is a potential complication of severe hepatitis and should be closely monitored.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has shown signs of improving platelet count, but close monitoring is required as thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications.
3. Chest pain: The patient's EKG showed a strain pattern, indicating possible cardiac involvement. This should be further investigated with a CTA coronaries.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and may require medication management once stable.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be corrected by changing IV fluids to D51/2 NS.
6. Potential fungal infection: Given the history of wild mushroom ingestion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute severe hepatitis after ingesting wild mushrooms. Her liver function tests (LFTs) initially rose but are now trending down. The patient underwent a failed ERCP-guided nasobiliary drain placement, but synthetic function appears to be improving. The patient's bilirubin levels are rising, which may be due to manipulation during the procedure or could be a lagging indicator of liver damage. Silibinin infusion is being continued, and the patient's LFTs and coagulation levels are being monitored closely. Mental status, asterixis, and clonus are also being closely monitored. Antiemetics are given as needed. Hepatology, transplant surgery, and toxicology recommendations are appreciated.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is improving. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are negative, and the cause of thrombocytopenia is likely splenomegaly and decreased thrombopoetin due to liver failure.

The patient complains of chest pain, and an EKG shows strain pattern. Beta-blockers (BB) have been started, and nitroglycerin (NTG) sublingual is given as needed. Aspirin (ASA) is being held in case transplantation is required, and a coronary angiography (CTA) is pending. Cardiology recommendations are appreciated.

The patient has uncontrolled hypertension and hypernat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a chief complaint of s/p amanita poisoning with liver failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing a persistent rise in bilirubin levels, despite transaminases trending down. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/74 to 131/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear HEENT examination, RR without abnormalities, faint LL crackles in the chest, soft mild RUQ tenderness in the abdomen, mild edema in the extremities, and no asterixis noted in the neuro examination.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (Na+/K+/Cl-).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chest pain - ongoing evaluation by cardiology.
2. Poisoning/overdose - monitoring liver function tests and bilirubin levels closely.
3. Hypertension - start metoprolol.
4. Chest pain - daily, cardiology consulted. Plan for CT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of amanita mushroom poisoning leading to liver failure. She is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications. Her transaminases are trending down, but her bilirubin levels continue to rise. The patient has been started on Silibinum for her liver condition and metoprolol for hypertension. She also has chest pain, for which cardiology has been consulted, and a plan for a CT coronary has been made. The patient's platelet count is falling, and she is being evaluated by hepatology for potential platelet transfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the ongoing liver failure and rising bilirubin levels, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy developing. This condition can cause altered mental status and confusion.
2. Coagulopathy: The falling platelet count indicates a potential risk of bleeding due to decreased clotting ability. Close monitoring and potential platelet transfusion may be necessary.
3. Infection: In patients with compromised liver function, the immune system is weakened, making them more susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is crucial.
4. Renal dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's chest pain and hypertension could"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman who was admitted with acute severe hepatitis following ingestion of Amanita mushrooms. The patient has a history of chocolate flavor allergy and no known drug allergies. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-179 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 81.3 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,521 mL (including 235 mL IV fluids), output of 2,480 mL (including 800 mL urine), resulting in a balance of 41 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and low platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests show a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Liver function tests reveal elevated AST and ALT levels, with a trend of improvement after silibinin infusion. Other lab values, including electrolytes and cardiac enzymes, are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, which is improving. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are negative. The patient also presents with chest pain, and an EKG showed a strain pattern. She was started"

The patient is a 72-year-old woman who presented with acute severe hepatitis after ingesting Amanita mushrooms. She has no history of allergies, and her last dose of antibiotics was on 11/20/2105 at 08:35 PM. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving silibinin infusion for her condition. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 156/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, and her fluid balance shows a net intake of 2,521 mL and output of 2,480 mL. She is also receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include sinus bradycardia and unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's platelet count is low but improving, and her coagulation profile is abnormal. She has elevated levels of troponin-T, CK-MB, D-dimer, and lactate acid, as well as decreased levels of fibrinogen and albumin. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal.

   Assessment and Plan
   72-year-old Russian-speaking woman s/p wild mushroom ingestion admitted
   with acute severe hepatitis.
   .
   #Amanita ocreata mushroom ingestion complicated by acute severe
   hepatitis - No evidence of hepatic encephalopathy; LFTs rapidly trended
   up on admission and now falling on silibinin; s/p failed ERCP-guided
   nasobiliary drain placement [**11-20**]; synthetic function appears to be
   improving; rising Tbili may be attributable to manipulation of ampulla
   during procedure but may also be lagging behind AST/ALT rise. Will
   continue to monitor closely as Tbili may be a poor prognostic factor
   for mushroom toxicity; tolerating regular diet
   -cont silibinin infusion 20 mg/kg/day, until INR < 1.2 or 5 day course
   (day 4)
   -monitor LFTs and coags q8h
   -closely monitor mental status, e/o asterixis, clonus
   -appreciate hepatology, transplant surgery, toxicology recs
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Stable, no e/o DIC by labs; may be due to decreased
   thrombopoetin production in the setting of hepatotoxicity; has not
   received heparin products
   -cont monitor

   #Chest pain: EKG with strain pattern
   -started BB

   -hold off on ASA in case requires transplantation (will start on
   discharge)
   -CTA coronaries on hold as appears as if may avoid transplant

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with acute severe hepatitis after ingesting Amanita mushrooms. She has been receiving silibinin infusions and her liver function tests (LFTs) have been improving. The patient is tolerating a regular diet and will continue with the silibinin infusion until her INR is below 1.2 or for a 5-day course. Her thrombocytopenia is stable, and there are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's chest pain is being managed with beta-blockers, nitrates as needed, and aspirin will be started on discharge. She is also being monitored for hypertension and potential fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is ambulating with the help of a nurse and physical therapist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient does not currently have evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, it is important to monitor her mental status closely as this can be a potential complication of acute severe hepatitis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to decreased thrombopoetin production in the setting of hepatotoxicity. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and it is important to ensure adequate perfusion and blood volume.
4. Chest"
