   Dark as well as some bright blood were seen in the stomach. A large
   clot that was found adhereing to the fundus during earlier
   endoscopy was now seen to extend from the fundus upto beyond the
   pylorus. After extensive flushing, the clot was dislodged and passed
   below into the antrum and pylorus. Subsequently a subcutaneous
   appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely
   a Dieulafuoy lesion.[10][1] The vessel was injected with a total of 8ml
   of 1:10,000 epinephrine. Attempts to clip the vessel failed three times
   due to mucosal sloughing. Subsequently the vessel was cauterized with a
   gold probe and hemostasis was achieved.

   [11][1] Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a
   large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds. It
   can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought
   to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was
   named after [**Name2 (NI) 4162**] surgeon [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 98**] [**Name (NI) 11867**] Dieulafoy, who described this
   condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Le
ons [**12-28**]"" in 1898. It is
   also called ""caliber-persistent artery"" or ""aneurysm"" of gastric
   vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms these are thought to be
   developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and MSSA bacteremia. She was admitted to the hospital for MSSA bacteremia and Charcot foot infected with MSSA. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely from aspirin/Plavix in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.

The patient's 24-hour events include a hematocrit (Hct) level that increased from 17% to 25% after receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 3 more units of pRBCs, and intubation. Despite this, the Hct level dropped to 21%, and a scope showed a large clot in the stomach. The patient became hypertensive and had swollen hands, and 20 mg of IV lasix was given. The patient's blood pressure remained high, and she received 2 more units of pRBCs. The patient's condition deteriorated, and she experienced desaturation to 50s, leading to a code blue. The patient was taken to the operating room for a fiber optic intubation followed by an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), where a lesion was cauterized.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues,"

   Dark as well as some bright blood were seen in the stomach. A large
   clot that was found adhereing to the fundus during earlier
   endoscopy was now seen to extend from the fundus upto beyond the
   pylorus. After extensive flushing, the clot was dislodged and passed
   below into the antrum and pylorus. Subsequently a subcutaneous
   appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely
   a Dieulafuoy lesion.[10][1] The vessel was injected with a total of 8ml
   of 1:10,000 epinephrine. Attempts to clip the vessel failed three times
   due to mucosal sloughing. Subsequently the vessel was cauterized with a
   gold probe and hemostasis was achieved.

   [11][1] Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a
   large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds. It
   can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought
   to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was
   named after [**Name2 (NI) 4162**] surgeon [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 98**] [**Name (NI) 11867**] Dieulafoy, who described this
   condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Le
ons [**12-28**]"" in 1898. It is
   also called ""caliber-persistent artery"" or ""aneurysm"" of gastric
   vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms these are thought to be
   developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and allergies to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's initial hemoglobin concentration was 17 g/dL, which decreased to 21 g/dL after receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells. Despite further transfusions, the patient's hemoglobin level continued to drop. An endoscopy revealed a large clot in the stomach, and a subcutaneous appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely a Dieulafoy lesion. The vessel was injected with epinephrine, attempts to clip it failed due to mucosal sloughing, and eventually, it was cauterized with a gold probe to achieve hemostasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dieulafoy lesion: This is a rare condition characterized by a large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Gastric hemorrhage: The initial presentation of the patient was upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
3. Hypovolemic shock: Due to the ongoing bleeding and transfusion requirements, the patient may develop hypovolemic shock, characterized by low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Organ dysfunction: Severe blood"

   Dark as well as some bright blood were seen in the stomach. A large
   clot that was found adhereing to the fundus during earlier
   endoscopy was now seen to extend from the fundus upto beyond the
   pylorus. After extensive flushing, the clot was dislodged and passed
   below into the antrum and pylorus. Subsequently a subcutaneous
   appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely
   a Dieulafuoy lesion.[1][1] The vessel was injected with a total of 8ml
   of 1:10,000 epinephrine. Attempts to clip the vessel failed three times
   due to mucosal sloughing. Subsequently the vessel was cauterized with a
   gold probe and hemostasis was achieved.

   Disposition:
   _______________________
   [2][1] Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a
   large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds. It
   can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought
   to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was
   named after [**Name2 (NI) 4162**] surgeon [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 98**] [**Name (NI) 11867**] Dieulafoy, who described this
   condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Le
ons [**12-28**]"" in 1898. It is
   also called ""caliber-persistent artery"" or ""aneurysm"" of gastric
   vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms these are thought to be
   developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with a chief complaint of severe bleeding, resulting in hemodynamic instability and shock.
- Initial management included fluid resuscitation and transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- An endoscopy was performed, revealing a large clot in the stomach. The clot was dislodged, but a Dieulafoy lesion was identified and treated with cauterization.
- The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and subsequent cardiac arrest.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and D-dimer levels, indicating a systemic inflammatory response and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient's glucose levels were elevated, and electrolyte imbalances were noted, including hypokalemia and hyponatremia.
- Renal function tests showed elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating possible acute kidney injury.
- The patient's liver function tests were within normal limits.
- Arterial blood gas analysis revealed respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including aggressive fluid resuscitation, blood product transfusions, and vasopressor support.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

   Dark as well as some bright blood were seen in the stomach. A large
   clot that was found adhereing to the fundus during earlier
   endoscopy was now seen to extend from the fundus upto beyond the
   pylorus. After extensive flushing, the clot was dislodged and passed
   below into the antrum and pylorus. Subsequently a subcutaneous
   appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely
   a Dieulafuoy lesion.[10][1] The vessel was injected with a total of 8ml
   of 1:10,000 epinephrine. Attempts to clip the vessel failed three times
   due to mucosal sloughing. Subsequently the vessel was cauterized with a
   gold probe and hemostasis was achieved.

   [11][1] Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a
   large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds. It
   can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought
   to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was
   named after [**Name2 (NI) 4162**] surgeon [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 98**] [**Name (NI) 11867**] Dieulafoy, who described this
   condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Le
ons [**12-28**]"" in 1898. It is
   also called ""caliber-persistent artery"" or ""aneurysm"" of gastric
   vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms these are thought to be
   developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and previous hospitalization for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and charcot foot infected with MSSA. The patient was admitted to the hospital for suspected MSSA bacteremia, hypotension from sepsis, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely due to aspirin/Plavix in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple interventions including intubation and endoscopy to control the upper GI bleed. Despite receiving 9 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 platelets, and 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions, the patient remains hypotensive with persistent melena output. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 126/58 mmHg to 190/93 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been relatively stable, ranging from 79 to 106 beats per minute.

The patient's respiratory status is currently supported by mechanical ventilation, with a ventilator mode set to CPAP/PSV. Oxygen delivery is through an endotracheal tube, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 20, and the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count with no clear source, likely due to stress response to the GI bleed. Blood cultures have been negative for MSSA bacteremia. Other laboratory values indicate hyponatremia (Na: 130), acute kidney injury (peak creatinine: 4.3), and anemia (Hct: 21-25%). The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (AST: 20, ALT: 8), elevated lactate (0.9 mmol/L), and decreased albumin (1.8 g/dL).

The patient's pain is managed with dilaudid IV, and she is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cervical disc disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications of retinopathy and neuropathy, and a history of CAD s/p CABG. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Re-bleeding from the Dieulafoy's lesion or other sources.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the ongoing bleeding and potential aspiration.
3. Progression of acute kidney injury or worsening of renal function.
4. Infection at the site of the Dieulafoy's lesion or other sources.
5. Hypotension and shock due to continued blood loss.
6. Further deterioration in the patient's neurological status due to hypotension and potential hypoxia.
7. Complications related to the patient's other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular events or worsening of diabetes control.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values to promptly identify and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Dark as well as some bright blood were seen in the stomach. A large
   clot that was found adhereing to the fundus during earlier
   endoscopy was now seen to extend from the fundus upto beyond the
   pylorus. After extensive flushing, the clot was dislodged and passed
   below into the antrum and pylorus. Subsequently a subcutaneous
   appearing blood vessel with mild oozing was noted in the fundus, likely
   a Dieulafuoy lesion.[10][1] The vessel was injected with a total of 8ml
   of 1:10,000 epinephrine. Attempts to clip the vessel failed three times
   due to mucosal sloughing. Subsequently the vessel was cauterized with a
   gold probe and hemostasis was achieved.

   [11][1] Dieulafoy's lesion is a medical condition characterized by a
   large tortuous arteriole in the stomach wall that erodes and bleeds. It
   can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought
   to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was
   named after [**Name2 (NI) 4162**] surgeon [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 98**] [**Name (NI) 11867**] Dieulafoy, who described this
   condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Le
ons [**12-28**]"" in 1898. It is
   also called ""caliber-persistent artery"" or ""aneurysm"" of gastric
   vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms these are thought to be
   developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and Charcot foot infected with MSSA. She presented with hypotension from sepsis and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely due to aspirin/Plavix use in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Upper GI bleed: Active bleeding that did not clear with nasogastric (NG) lavage. She underwent two endoscopies, with a clot in her stomach found during the first endoscopy, and the bleeding vessel was successfully cauterized during the second endoscopy.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient previously had MSSA bacteremia, but recent blood cultures are negative. She is currently receiving nafcillin.
3. Left Charcot foot and cellulitis: The patient has an infected left Charcot foot and cellulitis. She is also receiving nafcillin.
4. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient developed ATN likely due to hypotension in the setting of MSSA bacteremia. Her peak creatinine level is 4.3.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, Charcot foot, who is currently in the MICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, blood loss anemia, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with a Dieulafoy lesion, which is causing ongoing melena. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She is also experiencing respiratory failure and remains intubated for endoscopy, which was difficult. The attending physician will assess readiness for extubation conservatively and plans to use diuresis after the bleeding issue is resolved prior to extubation.

The patient has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 21.9. She also has acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion from significant blood loss. Her serum creatinine is elevated at 3.7 mg/dL. The patient has impaired skin integrity with a left Charcot foot that has a 6 cm linear incision probing deep into tissue/ligaments/bone at least 1.5 cm. She is at risk for infection, and there is a concern for cellulitis.

The patient has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II. She is also experiencing diarrhea. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease. She is currently hypotensive with a blood pressure of 126/58 mmHg. The patient is also hypokalemic with a potassium level of 3.3 mg/dL. She is anemic, secondary to blood loss.

Overall, the patient's conditions include GI bleed with a Dieulafoy lesion, ongoing melena, respiratory failure requiring intubation, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, diabetes mellitus type II, diarrhea, coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypokalemia, and anemia secondary to blood loss."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and a Charcot foot infected with MSSA. The patient also presented with hypotension from sepsis and a critical illness history, as well as a prior history of ulcers.

The patient has been intubated for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed that did not respond to 9 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 platelets, and 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She continues to have melena output. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is being maintained above 25 due to her coronary history and baseline Hct of 30. If there is a drop in Hct of more than 3, transfusion will be given.

The patient has leukocytosis with no clear source other than her foot, known bacteremia which has cleared per blood cultures, or diarrhea that is Clostridium difficile negative. It could be a stress response to the GI bleed. Trends in white blood cell count (WBC) are being monitored, along with follow-up blood cultures.

The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and repeat blood cultures are negative. Her temperature is trending to 99.5 on"

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She was admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and charcot foot infected with MSSA. She also had hypotension due to sepsis, and was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely caused by aspirin/Plavix use in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.

The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed a clot in the stomach during the first endoscopy and successful intervention with cautery during the second endoscopy. She was intubated for the second endoscopy and remains intubated. Despite receiving a total of 9 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 platelets, and 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units, she continues to have melena output.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, Charcot foot, and multiple comorbidities. She is currently admitted to the MICU for upper gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia. The patient underwent an EGD procedure to identify the source of bleeding, and a Dieulafoy lesion was found. She has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight. Her hemodynamics remain stable, and plans are in place to rescope today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleed may recur, potentially leading to further blood loss and anemia.
3. Bacteremia: The patient is at risk of developing bacteremia due to her compromised immune system and the presence of an indwelling line.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient already has leukocytosis, which can worsen if she develops an infection.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, increasing the risk of infections, particularly cellulitis in her left Charcot foot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, Charcot foot, and coronary artery disease. She is currently admitted to the MICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and blood loss anemia. The patient underwent endoscopy which revealed a Dieulafoy lesion causing ongoing melena. She has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusion overnight. The patient remains intubated for endoscopy and will be conservatively assessed for readiness for extubation. Her leukocyte count is slightly down today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to inability to protect airway.
2. Rebleeding or worsening of the GI bleed.
3. Development of sepsis or bacteremia due to impaired skin integrity and cellulitis.
4. Progression of acute renal failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
6. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure due to underlying coronary artery disease.
7. Hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis due to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
8. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Further deterioration in the patient's mental status or neurological function.
10. Development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and critical illness.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding and blood loss anemia. The patient is sedated and unable to provide their own history. They have a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and allergies to Bactrim.

The patient underwent an elective endoscopy this morning. They received two additional units of packed red blood cells overnight. They are currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion at 8 mg/hour and propofol at 40 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate ranging from 82-90 bpm, blood pressure between 117/45-128/63 mmHg, respiratory rate at 10-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 830 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a spontaneous respiratory rate of 12.

The patient's blood product balance shows a total input of 5,298 mL, with 2,651 mL of blood products transfused. The total output is 2,478 mL, with 1,028 mL of urine output, 1,450 mL of NG output, and 608 mL of stool output. The patient's fluid balance is positive at 2,820 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 353 K/uL, platelet count of 53 K/uL, sodium level of 129 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride level of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 28.1%, BUN level of 83 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 154 mg/dL, and liver function test results within normal range.

The patient's medical complications include upper gastrointestinal bleed, risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, inability to protect airway, bacteremia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, cellulitis in the left charcot foot with a deep incision, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, diarrhea, coronary artery disease, hyponatremia, hypertension, anemia secondary to blood loss, and potential complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Inability to protect airway due to altered gag reflex.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Bacteremia.
4. Leukocytosis.
5. Acute renal failure.
6. Impaired skin integrity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), admitted for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and charcot foot infected with MSSA. She presented with hypotension from sepsis and was transferred from another hospital due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely from aspirin/Plavix in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers. The patient underwent multiple endoscopic interventions for the upper GI bleed and remains intubated. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has several ongoing medical concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient had an active upper GI bleed that did not clear with nasogastric lavage. She received a total of 9 packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 platelets, and 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions but continues to have melena output. She is maintained on NPO (nothing by mouth), and her blood pressure is being monitored closely due to her coronary history and baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 30.

2. Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: The patient is intubated on pressure support of 5 and 10. She had a difficult intubation with concern for"

   24 Hour Events:
   Scoped by GI. Had stable clot, that they did not want to mess around
   with. They discussed the case with surgery. Surgery is following along
   but no immediate plans to take to OR while Hct, and hemodynamics are
   stable given that Pt is not ideal surgical candidate. They will be
   following and will continue to re-evaluate as things go on.
   Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11890**] from ID who mentioned that high dose
   nafcillin can lead to platelet dysfunction. In this setting, nafcillin
   was d/c and started vanco. CT scan of LE done, no final read back yet,
   but per nursing, podiatry had come by and said the scan looked OK. PM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. She was admitted to the ICU for MSSA bacteremia, charcot foot infected with MSSA, and hypotension from sepsis. The patient also had an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which did not clear with NG lavage. She underwent two unsuccessful endoscopic procedures and remains intubated. Her Hct has been stable for the last 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient initially had MSSA bacteremia, but repeat blood cultures were negative. She is being treated with vancomycin.
2. Left Charcot Foot and Cellulitis: The patient has a left charcot foot and cellulitis. She will be followed by podiatry/vascular surgery and requires further debridement once medically stable.
3. Upper GI Bleed: The patient had an active bleeding that did not clear with NG lavage. She underwent two endoscopic procedures and remains intubated. Her Hct has been stable for the last 24 hours.
4. Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: The patient is intubated on pressure support and has a reassuring cuff leak. She is currently doing well but may require diuresis if the bleed stabilizes.

   24 Hour Events:
   Scoped by GI. Had stable clot, that they did not want to mess around
   with. They discussed the case with surgery. Surgery is following along
   but no immediate plans to take to OR while Hct, and hemodynamics are
   stable given that Pt is not ideal surgical candidate. They will be
   following and will continue to re-evaluate as things go on.
   Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11890**] from ID who mentioned that high dose
   nafcillin can lead to platelet dysfunction. In this setting, nafcillin
   was d/c and started vanco. CT scan of LE done, no final read back yet,
   but per nursing, podiatry had come by and said the scan looked OK. PM

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for suspected necrotizing fasciitis. They have a history of congestive heart failure and allergies to Bactrim. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/57 mmHg to 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on propofol infusion, as well as other ICU medications. They have been receiving nafcillin and vancomycin for suspected bacterial infection. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, with no pain or discomfort reported.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with suspected necrotizing fasciitis, which is a severe bacterial infection. They have been started on nafcillin and vancomycin antibiotics. However, the patient developed a stable clot, and there are concerns about surgical intervention due to their unstable hemodynamics and medical comorbidities.

2. Thrombosis: The presence of a stable clot indicates the risk of thrombosis. Close monitoring and appropriate anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further clot progression.

3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of congestive"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, Charcot foot, and gastrointestinal bleed. She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to her critical condition. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed two gastric lesions with evidence of active bleeding. There has been some stability in her hematocrit (Hct) levels since receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). However, it is unclear if she has achieved lasting hemostasis.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation and respiratory mechanics have been good, and the plan is to aim for extubation tomorrow if her Hct remains stable.

Additionally, the patient has a left lower extremity (LLE) infection, specifically a deep wound infection in her Charcot foot. A computed tomography (CT) scan shows a stable fluid collection. She also has methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and has been switched from nafcillin to vancomycin to address potential platelet dysfunction.

The patient is also dealing with acute renal failure/acute tubular necrosis (ARF/ATN), which is showing a decreasing trend. The rest of her issues are being managed by the ICU team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and an infected charcot foot. She also had an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely due to aspirin/Plavix use in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers. The patient was intubated for the second endoscopy and remains intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: The patient is currently doing well intubated on pressure support. However, there is a concern for laryngeal edema and the need for extubation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with no clear source other than the foot, known bacteremia, or stress response to GI bleed. Regular monitoring of white blood cell count and follow-up blood cultures are recommended.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: Although the repeat blood cultures are negative, it is essential to continue vancomycin and follow-up with repeat blood cultures as per ID recommendations.
4. Left Charcot Foot and Cellulitis: The patient's left charcot foot and cellulitis require ongoing management by podiatry/vascular"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He has a history of congestive heart failure, allergies to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was started on diuretics, specifically Lasix, in the evening and has lost approximately 800cc of fluid. His blood sugars have been low, so his insulin dosage was reduced. His phosphate levels are rising.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/52 to 150/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 600-761 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 35. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.17.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.7 g/dL, moderately low platelet count (Plt) of 58 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.3 mg/dL, hypoglycemia with glucose levels ranging from 58-65 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), and dextrose 50%. He also has a PICC line placed for fluid administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Volume depletion: The patient has lost a significant amount of fluid, which may lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been low, indicating the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of insulin dosages.

3. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are rising, which can contribute to metabolic disturbances and may require phosphate binders or dialysis.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is stable at the moment, but ongoing monitoring is required to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

5. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for further infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is moderately low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.

7. Renal dysfunction:"

   # Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: Currently doing well intubated on
   pressure support. Difficult intubation with concern for laryngeal
   edema. Has reassuring cuff leak.  Responded well to 20 IV lasix (800cc
   urine).
   -          Extubate today
   # Leukocytosis: no clear source other than foot, known bacteremia which
   has cleared per blood cultures or diarrhea that is c. diff neg. Could
   be stress response to GI bleed.  No further spread of LLE erythema

   -          Continue HISS but only treat BG > 200 given currently NPO
   -          Renally dose gabapentin and hold until while patient NPO
   Pain: concern that tylenol could be masking fevers
   -          Continue dilaudid IV for pain
   CAD s/p CABG [**2197**]:  last intervention > 1 year ago, given acute upper

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and an infected charcot foot. The patient also presented with hypotension from sepsis and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely caused by aspirin/Plavix use in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient had an active upper GI bleed that did not clear with nasogastric lavage. She required endoscopic intervention with cautery to control the bleeding. She remains intubated and is currently stable.
2. Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: The patient is intubated on pressure support and is doing well. However, there was difficulty with intubation due to concern for laryngeal edema. She responded well to intravenous lasix (800cc urine output).
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to stress response to the GI bleed, known bacteremia that has cleared per blood cultures, or diarrhea that is C. diff negative.
4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, but repeat blood cultures are negative"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, Charcot foot, currently admitted to the MICU with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, blood loss anemia, respiratory failure, left lower extremity (LLE) infection, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of melena, indicating upper GI bleeding. Although the recent Hct has been stable for over 48 hours, it is important to monitor it regularly and continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Close collaboration with gastroenterology and surgery is recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently mechanically ventilated and has shown improvement, as she passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Extubation is planned for today with the presence of anesthesia due to a difficult airway. Gentle diuresis is being continued.

3. LLE Infection: The patient has a left Charcot foot with an open wound that extends deep into the tissue, ligaments, and bone. Repeat debridement is necessary, likely tomorrow.

4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is currently receiving vancomycin to treat MSSA bacteremia.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has been diagnosed with ARF, possibly due to acute tubular nec"

- The patient is a 49-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and a charcot foot infected with MSSA.
- She also presented with hypotension from sepsis and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely due to aspirin/Plavix use in a setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers.
- The patient underwent multiple endoscopic procedures to manage the GI bleed, including cautery during the second endoscopy.
- She was intubated for the second endoscopy and remains intubated.
- The patient's Hct has been stable for the last 24 hours.
- Current medications include pantoprazole, furosemide, and hydromorphone.
- The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to stress response to the GI bleed and cleared MSSA bacteremia.
- She has a left charcot foot and cellulitis, which are being managed by podiatry/vascular surgery.
- The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) attributed to hypotension in the setting of MSSA bacteremia.
- Her sodium levels were initially low but have improved with volume and hydration.
- Other issues include hypertension, resolved hyponatremia, diarrhea (possibly antibiotic-associated), cervical disc disease, diabetes-related complications"

2. Respiratory status/Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient is currently doing well intubated on pressure support. There was a concern for laryngeal edema during intubation, but the patient responded well to IV lasix. The plan is to extubate the patient today.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL. The source of leukocytosis is unclear, but it could be due to stress response to GI bleed or other factors such as infection. The plan is to trend WBC and follow-up blood cultures.

4. MSSA bacteremia: The patient previously had MSSA bacteremia, but repeat blood cultures are negative. The patient is currently on vancomycin and will continue to follow-up with repeat blood cultures.

5. Left Charcot foot and cellulitis: The patient has a non-healing wound on the left foot with cellulitis. A non-contrast CT scan of the left"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and an infected left foot. She also has an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely due to the use of aspirin and Plavix in the setting of critical illness and prior history of ulcers. The patient underwent multiple endoscopic interventions for the GI bleed and was intubated during the second endoscopy. She was extubated yesterday and is currently doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient previously had MSSA bacteremia, but repeat blood cultures are negative. She is currently on vancomycin and will continue to be monitored for any signs of bacteremia or infection.
2. Left Charcot Foot and Cellulitis: The patient has a left charcot foot and cellulitis, which are being managed by podiatry/vascular surgery. Non-contrast CT of the left lower extremity showed no obvious fluid collection. The patient will continue on vancomycin and follow-up on final tissue cultures. Monitoring for improvement and surgical recommendations will be appreciated.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2 puts her at risk for DKA. It would be important to monitor her blood glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was initially scheduled for a podiatric procedure but it was deferred due to instability. The patient's Hct remained stable throughout the day. The patient is on pantoprazole infusion and other ICU medications. The husband is at the bedside, and the plan is to transfer the patient to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Surgical complications: Since the patient was initially scheduled for a podiatric procedure, there is a risk of surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient is on oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, indicating possible respiratory distress or difficulty in breathing. This could be due to underlying lung conditions or complications from other medical conditions.

3. Cardiac problems: The blood pressure readings show fluctuations, and the patient's heart rate is slightly elevated. These changes may indicate cardiac issues such as hypertension or arrhythmias.

4. Infection risk: The patient has allergies to certain antibiotics, which may limit the options for treating any potential infections. Additionally, the presence of IV lines and other invasive procedures increases the risk of developing infections.

5. Renal impairment: The creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This could be caused by various factors, including dehydration, medication side effects, or underlying kidney disease.

6. Coagulation abnormalities: The platelet count is slightly low, and the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- She was admitted to the hospital for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and an infected Charcot foot.
- The patient experienced hypotension due to sepsis and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which was likely caused by aspirin and Plavix in the setting of critical illness and a prior history of ulcers.
- She required intubation for the second endoscopy to control the bleeding and was subsequently extubated.
- The patient's Hct has remained stable for several days, and her WBC count is elevated, possibly due to stress response to the GI bleed or ongoing infection.
- She has been diagnosed with respiratory status/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), leukocytosis, MSSA bacteremia, left Charcot foot and cellulitis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypertension, hyponatremia, diarrhea, cervical disc disease, diabetes mellitus, pain, and vitamin D deficiency.
- The plan includes maintaining central venous pressure (CVP) and power-pitched central venous catheter (PICC) line, transitioning to clear liquids, and considering advancement to a full diet.
- The patient will be monitored for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for MSSA bacteremia and an infected charcot foot. She had an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which was initially managed with nasogastric lavage but required multiple endoscopies to control the bleeding. She was intubated during the second endoscopy and extubated afterwards. Her Hct has remained stable over the past few days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status/Diastolic CHF: The patient had respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and her SpO2 remained at 97%. However, there is a concern for diastolic CHF given her history of coronary artery disease and hypotension from sepsis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.9, which could be due to stress response to GI bleed or ongoing infection. It is important to trend WBC counts and monitor for any signs of infection.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, but repeat blood cultures have been negative. Vancomycin is being continued, and further follow-up is needed to ensure clearance of the infection.
4. Left Charcot Foot and Cellulitis: The patient has left charcot foot and cellulitis, which requires further debrid"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type II, Charcot foot, and multiple medical complications. She is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, blood loss anemia, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/51 to 164/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's recent history includes ongoing left lower extremity (LLE) infection, which is expected to undergo debridement by podiatry tomorrow. She also has MSSA bacteremia, for which vancomycin is being continued. Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), with creatinine levels improving over time. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 429 K/uL. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include various medical complications such as inability to protect airway, gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, cellulitis in the left charcot foot, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, diarrhea, coronary artery disease, hyponatremia, hypertension, benign, and anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening respiratory failure due to the inability to protect the airway, further deterioration of renal function, progression of the LLE infection leading to cellulitis or osteomyelitis, worsening of the gastrointestinal bleed, and potential cardiovascular events related to coronary artery disease."
