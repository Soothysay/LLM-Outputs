","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of bacteremia of unknown cause, possible right-sided cancer in the pleural space, and diagnosed with e.coli bacteremia. She presented with flash pulmonary edema, which has now improved. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/33-131/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 92%, and temperature at 35.8°C. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, cardiac support, and pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is experiencing crackles in the bases of her lungs, indicating potential respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and is currently being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors.
3. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, there is still a concern for ongoing infection due to the presence of bacteremia. The source of the infection is unclear, with possibilities including urinary tract infection or gastrointestinal infection.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Lung cancer: The patient has a suspected right-sided lung cancer, which could contribute to respiratory and overall health complications.

She has been treated with lasix, nitroglycerin, and bipap. The patient's condition improved overnight and bipap was stopped this morning. She is currently on several medications including atorvastatin, synthroid, omeprazole, detrol, aspirin, lisinopril, multivitamins, amlodipine, calcium, vitamin D, colace, iron, senna, atenolol, zosyn, and ipratropium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/33-131/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 64, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 186. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, presence of jugular venous distention, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, crackles in the bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive mental status.

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with hx of probably lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions,
   hx of breast cancer, hx of CAD with diastolic heart failure and HTN who
   presented to the MICU after an episode consistent with flash pulmonary
   edema, still tenous resipratory status.
   .
   # Hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure - acute in nature and in
   association with hypertension.  Likely flash pulmonary edema.
   Responded to lasix, nitro and morphine today.  Unclear precipitating
   event that caused the flash edema, although likely worsening heart
   failure.  Will treat diastolic CHF and effusions as discussed below for
   the acute and chronic nature of her respiratory problems.
   - stable on 4 L nasal canula for now, cont to wean to home settings of
   2L PRN
   .
   # CHF
 has diastolic heart failure, likely worsening in the setting of
   hypertension.
   - hold off on diuresis this morning, will reevaluate post thoracentesis
   - continue blood pressure control and afterload reduction; had stopped
   amlodipine yesterday, will titrate up lisinopril as tolerated by blood
   pressures
   - change atenolol to metoprolol for better control of BP, titrate up as
   needed
   .
   # Bilateral pleural effusion - stable on CXR, IP following along with
   plan for thoracentesis in morning. Underwent first thoracentesis in
   [**11-1**] and talc pleurodesis in [**2-2**].  Goal for therapeutic tap to
   improve her dyspnea.
   - thoracentesis per IP this afternoon
   .
   # E.coli Bacteremia - has e.coli in blood.  Patient afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable at this time; unclear source.  Was on both zosyn
   and cipro during this hospitalization.  Transferred on zosyn.
   - will stop zosyn and switch to cipro as e.coli is pan sensitive
   - plan for 14 day total course
   .
   # Leukocytosis - has new leukocytosis from 7 to 12 after admission to
   MICU, now normalized again today.  Switching from zosyn to cipro today,
   and will continue for bacteremia as above.
   - following up cultures, no new growth to date
   .
   # CHF
 echo showed hypertrophied LV consistent with some diastolic
   dysfunction.  Has preserved systolic function and some valvular
   disease.  Contributed to flash edema today in setting of hypertension.
   - holding lasix this morning, thoracentesis this afternoon
   - switching from atenolol to metoprolol; titrating up lisinopril for BP
   control
   .
   # CAD - hx of CAD, no changed on EKG post flash, but need to consider
   ischemia as possible cause of worsened heart failure.
   - CEs negative
   .
   # Anemia - pt with  baseline hct in high 30s now in high 20s, stable.
   Guiac neg, iron studies consistent with iron deficiency; B12 and folate
   were normal.
   - cont iron supplementation
   - outpatient workup if so desired
   .
   # Lung CA - likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma, possibly contributing to
   worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions.
   - follow up with oncologist for treatment plan
   - IP for thoracentesis
   - continue nasal O2 as needed for comfort
   .
   # H/o breast CA - no active issues, continue outpatient followup.
   .
   # H/o PE - pt admitted with INR of 3.6. Will hold coumadin until INR
   <3, particularly in the setting of antibiotics.
   - on lovenox now; consider resetarting coumadin after procedures
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - cont home levothyroxine
   .
   # L carotid bruit - stable
   -consider u/s as outpt if it seems appropriate (pt likely would not
   want to undergo endarterectomy)
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - cont statin.

The patient is a [age]-year-old [male/female] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. They have a history of allergies to metronidazole, morphine, and Percocet. The patient received lasix, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-169 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with an intake of 755 mL and output of 1385 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. The patient has a history of heart failure (diastolic), acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to severe lung dysfunction and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection, which could worsen the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions, breast cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and diastolic heart failure. She presented to the MICU overnight with an episode consistent with flash pulmonary edema. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusion, E. coli bacteremia, leukocytosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), CAD, anemia, lung cancer, and a history of breast cancer. The patient responded to lasix, nitro, and morphine today, and her blood pressure is predominantly in the 100s-120s systolic range during the day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure - The patient is currently experiencing difficulty in breathing due to high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen saturation. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Bilateral pleural effusion - The presence of fluid accumulation in the pleural space can cause compression of the lungs and lead to respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea. If left untreated, it may result in pneumonia or other complications related to compromised lung function.

3. E. coli bacteremia - The presence of E. coli in the blood indicates a systemic infection, which can spread to different organs and cause severe complications like sepsis or organ failure.

4. Leukocytosis - An elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. If not properly managed, it can progress to a severe infection or sepsis.

5. Congestive heart failure (CHF) - The patient's history of diastolic heart failure, along with the current episode of flash pulmonary edema, suggests ongoing CHF. If not managed effectively, CHF can lead to worsening heart function, fluid overload, and potentially fatal outcomes.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD) - The patient's history of CAD increases her risk of ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina. These conditions can be life-threatening if not promptly recognized and treated.

7. Anemia - Although the patient's anemia is currently stable, if left untreated, it can lead to fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of infections.

8. Lung cancer - The patient's likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma may contribute to worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions. If not managed appropriately, lung cancer can lead to respiratory distress and compromised lung function.

9. History of breast cancer - Although there are no active issues related to the patient's breast cancer history, it is essential to continue outpatient follow-up to monitor for any potential recurrence or complications.

10. Prothrombin time (PT) - The patient's PT is elevated due to the use of antibiotics. It is important to monitor and manage the PT"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with hx of probably lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions,
   hx of breast cancer, hx of CAD with diastolic heart failure and HTN who
   presented to the MICU after an episode consistent with flash pulmonary
   edema, still tenous resipratory status.
   .
   # Hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure - acute in nature and in
   association with hypertension.  Likely flash pulmonary edema.
   Responded to lasix, nitro and morphine today.  Unclear precipitating
   event that caused the flash edema, although likely worsening heart
   failure.  Will treat diastolic CHF and effusions as discussed below for
   the acute and chronic nature of her respiratory problems.
   - stable on 4 L nasal canula for now, cont to wean to home settings of
   2L PRN
   .
   # CHF
 has diastolic heart failure, likely worsening in the setting of
   hypertension.
   - continue daily diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix, will likely need to have
   increased home dosing
   - goal neg 500 to 1L
   - continue blood pressure control and afterload reduction; had stopped
   amlodipine yesterday, will titrate up lisinopril as tolerated by blood
   pressures
   - continue beta blocker for BP and HR control
   .
   # Bilateral pleural effusion - stable on CXR, IP following along with
   plan for thoracentesis in morning. Underwent first thoracentesis in
   [**11-1**] and talc pleurodesis in [**2-2**].  Goal for therapeutic tap to
   improve her dyspnea.
   - thoracentesis per IP if clinically stable
   - consider pleurodex catheter
   .
   # E.coli Bacteremia - has e.coli in blood.  Patient afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable at this time; unclear source.  Was on both zosyn
   and cipro during this hospitalization.  Transferred on zosyn.
   - cont zosyn
   - touch base with primary team about plan for abx in morning
   .
   # Leukocytosis - has new leukocytosis from 7 to 12 after admission to
   MICU.  No obvious new source of infection, no fever, CXR without focal
   infiltrate.  Already on zosyn, consider coverage with for staph because
   of red L arm, but will not start unless febrile or clinically changing.
   - add staph/strep coverage if febrile, leukocytosis worsening
   - re culture blood and urine
   - f/u final read of CXR
   .
   # CHF - echo today showed hypertrophied LV consistent with some
   diastolic dysfunction.  Has preserved systolic function and some
   valvular disease.  Contributed to flash edema today in setting of
   hypertension.
   - continue lasix with daily dosing for goal of neg 500cc to 1L
   - best to increase lisinopril PRN for afterload reduction
   .
   # CAD - hx of CAD, no changed on EKG post flash, but need to consider
   ischemia as possible cause of worsened heart failure.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Anemia - pt with  baseline hct in high 30s now in high 20s, stable.
   Guiac neg, iron studies consistent with iron deficiency; B12 and folate
   were normal.
   - cont iron supplementation
   - outpatient workup if so desired
   .
   # Lung CA - likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma, possibly contributing to
   worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions.
   - follow up with oncologist for treatment plan
   - IP for thoracentesis
   - continue nasal O2 as needed for comfort
   .
   # H/o breast CA - no active issues, continue outpatient followup.
   .
   # H/o PE - pt admitted with INR of 3.6. Will hold coumadin until INR
   <3, particularly in the setting of antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions, breast cancer, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented to the MICU after an episode consistent with flash pulmonary edema. She is still in tenous respiratory status and has been responding to lasix, nitro, and morphine. The likely precipitating event causing the flash edema is unclear, although it may be worsening heart failure in the setting of hypertension. The patient's current assessment includes hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute in nature and in association with hypertension. The plan includes treating diastolic CHF and effusions, weaning off the nasal cannula, continuing daily diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix, increasing home dosing, titrating up lisinopril as tolerated by blood pressures, and continuing blood pressure control and afterload reduction. Other issues include E. coli bacteremia, leukocytosis, CHF with diastolic heart failure, CAD with possible ischemia, anemia, lung CA, h/o breast CA, h/o PE, hypothyroidism, L carotid bruit, dyslipidemia, GERD, osteoporosis, and PT consult pending. The patient has DNR/I code status and is currently on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented with e.coli bacteremia and flash pulmonary edema, which has now improved but still shows signs of limited pulmonary edema and a likely left pleural effusion.

The patient's medical history includes acute and chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) possibly caused by the pleural effusion. The plan includes adjusting blood pressure medications, uptitrating angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and switching to beta-blockers like metoprolol and atenolol. The patient will also be evaluated for an intercostal pleurodesis procedure.

Regarding the e.coli bacteremia, the plan is to switch to ciprofloxacin orally to complete a two-week course. As for the history of PE, the patient will hold anticoagulant therapy due to the likely procedure and will restart when appropriate.

The patient has goals of care that will be discussed with her daughter, including a consult for care.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on regular diet, with glycemic control managed using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on August 29th. Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and venous throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with a likely diagnosis of lung cancer, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and previous pulmonary embolisms (PEs). She presented with E. coli bacteremia and flash pulmonary edema, which have improved but she remains limited by pulmonary edema and a possible left pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 165/43 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased total fluid input of 755 mL, with a negative fluid balance of 630 mL since 12 AM. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels, while other markers remain within normal range. Imaging shows worsening left pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and left pleural effusion:
   - Adjust blood pressure medications by uptitrating ACE inhibitors and switching to metoprolol and atenolol.
   - Consider intrapleural drainage (IP) today to address the left pleural effusion and discuss the possibility of pleurodesis.
   - Email outpatient cards regarding the medication regimen.

2. E. coli bacteremia:
   - Switch to cipro"

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure - acute in nature, likely caused by worsening heart failure and hypertension.
2. Diastolic heart failure - worsening in the setting of hypertension.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion - goal for therapeutic tap to improve dyspnea.
4. E.coli bacteremia - unclear source, afebrile, and hemodynamically stable at this time.
5. CAD - history of CAD, no changes on EKG post flash, need to consider ischemia as a possible cause of worsened heart failure.
6. Anemia - baseline hct in high 30s now in high 20s, stable.
7. Lung CA - likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma, possibly contributing to worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions.
8. History of breast CA - no active issues, continue outpatient followup.
9. History of PE - admitted with INR of 3.6, will hold coumad"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with hx of probably lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions,
   hx of breast cancer, hx of CAD with diastolic heart failure and HTN who
   presented to the MICU after an episode consistent with flash pulmonary
   edema, still tenous resipratory status.
   .
   # Hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure - acute in nature and in
   association with hypertension.  Likely flash pulmonary edema.
   Responded to lasix, nitro and morphine today.  Unclear precipitating
   event that caused the flash edema, although likely worsening heart
   failure.  Will treat diastolic CHF and effusions as discussed below for
   the acute and chronic nature of her respiratory problems.
   - stable on 4 L nasal canula for now, cont to wean to home settings of
   2L PRN
   .
   # CHF
 has diastolic heart failure, likely worsening in the setting of
   hypertension.
   - hold off on diuresis this morning, will reevaluate post thoracentesis
   - continue blood pressure control and afterload reduction; had stopped
   amlodipine yesterday, will titrate up lisinopril as tolerated by blood
   pressures
   - change atenolol to metoprolol for better control of BP, titrate up as
   needed
   .
   # Bilateral pleural effusion - stable on CXR, IP following along with
   plan for thoracentesis in morning. Underwent first thoracentesis in
   [**11-1**] and talc pleurodesis in [**2-2**].  Goal for therapeutic tap to
   improve her dyspnea.
   - thoracentesis per IP this afternoon
   .
   # E.coli Bacteremia - has e.coli in blood.  Patient afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable at this time; unclear source.  Was on both zosyn
   and cipro during this hospitalization.  Transferred on zosyn.
   - will stop zosyn and switch to cipro as e.coli is pan sensitive
   - plan for 14 day total course
   .
   # Leukocytosis - has new leukocytosis from 7 to 12 after admission to
   MICU, now normalized again today.  Switching from zosyn to cipro today,
   and will continue for bacteremia as above.
   - following up cultures, no new growth to date
   .
   # CHF
 echo showed hypertrophied LV consistent with some diastolic
   dysfunction.  Has preserved systolic function and some valvular
   disease.  Contributed to flash edema today in setting of hypertension.
   - holding lasix this morning, thoracentesis this afternoon
   - switching from atenolol to metoprolol; titrating up lisinopril for BP
   control
   .
   # CAD - hx of CAD, no changed on EKG post flash, but need to consider
   ischemia as possible cause of worsened heart failure.
   - CEs negative
   .
   # Anemia - pt with  baseline hct in high 30s now in high 20s, stable.
   Guiac neg, iron studies consistent with iron deficiency; B12 and folate
   were normal.
   - cont iron supplementation
   - outpatient workup if so desired
   .
   # Lung CA - likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma, possibly contributing to
   worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions.
   - follow up with oncologist for treatment plan
   - IP for thoracentesis
   - continue nasal O2 as needed for comfort
   .
   # H/o breast CA - no active issues, continue outpatient followup.
   .
   # H/o PE - pt admitted with INR of 3.6. Will hold coumadin until INR
   <3, particularly in the setting of antibiotics.
   - on lovenox now; consider resetarting coumadin after procedures
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - cont home levothyroxine
   .
   # L carotid bruit - stable
   -consider u/s as outpt if it seems appropriate (pt likely would not
   want to undergo endarterectomy)
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - cont statin.
   .
   # GERD - Cont omeprazole.
   .
   # Osteoporosis - fosamax, Ca, Vit D.
   .
   # PT consult pending.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO while on bipap

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 120 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 97 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 27.3%, blood urea nitrogen of 6.5 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 200 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02 ng/mL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR at 12.8/24.5/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T at 33//0.04, and differential showing neutrophils at 89.4%, lymphocytes at 6.3%, monocytes at 3.7%, eosinophils at 0.4%, and lactic acid at 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular or skin abnormalities, and her neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, and an echocardiogram showed hypertrophied LV consistent with some diastolic dysfunction. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, acute in nature, associated with hypertension and likely flash pulmonary edema. The patient responded to lasix, nitro, and morphine today, and it is unclear what precipitated the flash edema, although worsening heart failure is a possibility.

The patient's plan includes continuing blood pressure control and afterload reduction, switching from atenolol to metoprolol for better control of BP, titrating up lisinopril as tolerated by blood pressures, holding off on diuretics this morning, reevaluating post-thoracentesis, and performing a thoracentesis in the morning. The patient has e. coli bacteremia, leukocytosis, anemia, and lung cancer, among other comorbidities. The patient's code status is DNR/I, and her disposition is ICU for now, with consideration for transfer to the floor after thoracentesis."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with hx of probably lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions,
   hx of breast cancer, hx of CAD with diastolic heart failure and HTN who
   presented to the MICU after an episode consistent with flash pulmonary
   edema, still tenous resipratory status.
   .
   # Hypercarbic, hypoxic respiratory failure - acute in nature and in
   association with hypertension.  Likely flash pulmonary edema.
   Responded to lasix, nitro and morphine today.  Unclear precipitating
   event that caused the flash edema, although likely worsening heart
   failure.  Will treat diastolic CHF and effusions as discussed below for
   the acute and chronic nature of her respiratory problems.
   - stable on 4 L nasal canula for now, cont to wean to home settings of
   2L PRN
   .
   # CHF
 has diastolic heart failure, likely worsening in the setting of
   hypertension.
   - hold off on diuresis this morning, will reevaluate post thoracentesis
   - continue blood pressure control and afterload reduction; had stopped
   amlodipine yesterday, will titrate up lisinopril as tolerated by blood
   pressures
   - change atenolol to metoprolol for better control of BP, titrate up as
   needed
   .
   # Bilateral pleural effusion - stable on CXR, IP following along with
   plan for thoracentesis in morning. Underwent first thoracentesis in
   [**11-1**] and talc pleurodesis in [**2-2**].  Goal for therapeutic tap to
   improve her dyspnea.
   - thoracentesis per IP this afternoon
   .
   # E.coli Bacteremia - has e.coli in blood.  Patient afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable at this time; unclear source.  Was on both zosyn
   and cipro during this hospitalization.  Transferred on zosyn.
   - will stop zosyn and switch to cipro as e.coli is pan sensitive
   - plan for 14 day total course
   .
   # Leukocytosis - has new leukocytosis from 7 to 12 after admission to
   MICU, now normalized again today.  Switching from zosyn to cipro today,
   and will continue for bacteremia as above.
   - following up cultures, no new growth to date
   .
   # CHF
 echo showed hypertrophied LV consistent with some diastolic
   dysfunction.  Has preserved systolic function and some valvular
   disease.  Contributed to flash edema today in setting of hypertension.
   - holding lasix this morning, thoracentesis this afternoon
   - switching from atenolol to metoprolol; titrating up lisinopril for BP
   control
   .
   # CAD - hx of CAD, no changed on EKG post flash, but need to consider
   ischemia as possible cause of worsened heart failure.
   - CEs negative
   .
   # Anemia - pt with  baseline hct in high 30s now in high 20s, stable.
   Guiac neg, iron studies consistent with iron deficiency; B12 and folate
   were normal.
   - cont iron supplementation
   - outpatient workup if so desired
   .
   # Lung CA - likely bronchoalveolar carcinoma, possibly contributing to
   worsening baseline hypoxia and pleural effusions.
   - follow up with oncologist for treatment plan
   - IP for thoracentesis
   - continue nasal O2 as needed for comfort
   .
   # H/o breast CA - no active issues, continue outpatient followup.
   .
   # H/o PE - pt admitted with INR of 3.6. Will hold coumadin until INR
   <3, particularly in the setting of antibiotics.
   - on lovenox now; consider resetarting coumadin after procedures
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - cont home levothyroxine
   .
   # L carotid bruit - stable
   -consider u/s as outpt if it seems appropriate (pt likely would not
   want to undergo endarterectomy)
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - cont statin.
   .
   # GERD - Cont omeprazole.
   .
   # Osteoporosis - fosamax, Ca, Vit D.
   .
   # PT consult pending.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of lung cancer, breast cancer, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the MICU with symptoms consistent with flash pulmonary edema. She is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress and has been placed on bipap. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 157/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and is scheduled for a thoracentesis. Her ejection fraction is normal, but she has diastolic dysfunction. She also has anemia, likely due to iron deficiency, and a history of hypertension. The patient has a DNR code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and hypoxia can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic heart failure increases the risk of heart failure exacerbation, which could be worsened by her lung cancer and pleural effusions.
3. E.coli bacteremia: The patient has E.coli in her blood, indicating bacteremia. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and history of PE increase the risk of thromboemb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of likely lung cancer and HFpEF who presented with flash pulmonary edema. The cause of the pulmonary edema is unclear, but the patient has shown improvement. The patient's medical history includes allergies to metronidazole and morphine, as well as confusion associated with Percocet use. She has been receiving various medications including lipid, detrol, ASA, omeprazole, Tums, vitamin D, iron, senna, and Lovenox (held). The patient also takes lisinopril 10mg.

Review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, crackles in the bibasilar region of the lungs, and absent pulses in the right and left dorsalis pedis (DP) arteries.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 96/28mmHg to 171/92mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total input and output being 520 mL and 670 mL, respectively. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a Foley catheter in place.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with likely lung cancer and HFpEF who presented with flash pulmonary edema of unclear precipitant, now improved. The patient has a history of allergies to metronidazole and morphine, as well as confusion associated with Percocet use. She received antibiotics including piperacillin, tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth and no abdominal pain or nausea. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal range, with a blood pressure of 146/43 mmHg and heart rate of 67 bpm. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bibasilar on chest auscultation, and her extremities are absent on the right and left sides. Neurologic assessment is not complete due to the patient's alertness and ability to follow simple commands.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine and troponin-T levels. Imaging shows a smaller left-sided effusion on chest X-ray, and microbiology reveals bacteremia with E. coli. The patient is currently being treated for HFpEF, bacteremia, and potential pulmonary embolism.

Plan:
The patient's condition is stable, and she is awaiting a possible procedure for dyspnea"
