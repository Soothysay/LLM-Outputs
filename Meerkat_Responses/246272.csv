   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:72M h/o CAD s/p MI s/p CABG (6), systolic
   CHF (EF 15%) s/p ICD, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus admitted,
   sleep apnea on BIPAP to SICU from OSH([**Location (un) 2408**]) with confusion s/p fall
   found on Head CT to have subdural hematoma s/p evacuation/burr hole. On
   arrival was in afib managed with IV metoprolol given NPO and on BIPAP
   s/p extubation post burrhole/evacuation. Cards consult for assitance
   with cardiac management given hx, with assessment that there was no
   evidence CHF/active ischemia and to continue cards meds (plavix/asa
   were being held given head bleed. Had been holding his lasix and
   antihtn's (lisinopril 10, carvedilol 12.5) and pt received 3L IV fluids
   in OR. Overnight became more tachypneic with poor UOP received 10mg IV
   lasix an [**9-5**] 9am then another 20mg IV with only small increase in UOP
   but hypotensive to mid 80s with boluses. Noted by cards on f/u to be
   clinically volume overload consistent with CVP of 24 with Bedside Echo
   poor quality but showed Afib, stable severe LV dilation with EF 15%,
   elevated LA pressure, 1 + MR with no priors for comparison. Initial CXR
   on admission showed pulmonary congestion, repeat CXR at this point did
   not show any change. Also noted to have worsening Cr from 1.3 on
   admission to 1.9 currently. He was at this point admitted to CCU
   service for management heart failure.
   .
   On transfer to cards he was +ve 1500cc for the day with CVP 24.
   Switched to lasix gtt, with goal UOP 100-150cc/hr. He restarted his
   carvedilol although lisinopril was held given his renal failure.
   .
   On review of systems,per daughter pt had ""platelet allergy in
   ambulance, hx unclear. he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.he
   denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock
   or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   LABS/STUDIEs:
   TELEMETRY: AF intermittenly paced
   ECG [**2109-2-2**]: AF with intermitted ventricular pacing. LBBB in native
   beats.
   Head CT:
   1. Large lentiform predominantly hypodense extra-axial collection along
   the left cerebral hemisphere, with hyperdense rim and internal
   septations, compatible with chronic subdural hematoma. This collection
   causes substantial mass effect, including rightward subfalcine
   herniation and early left uncal herniation. Findings not changed from
   one day prior.
   2. Hypodense evolving subacute posterior right temporal lobe infarct,
   in the territory of the right MCA, unchanged.
   .
   CXR: A dual-lead pacemaker generator overlies the left upper
   hemithorax, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
   ventricle. Median sternotomy wires are in place. Lung volumes are low.
   Bilaterally, there is perihilar vascular congestion. The heart is
   enlarged. There may be a trace right effusion, but there is no left
   pleural effusion or consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion.
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**2109-2-3**]
   The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). The
   right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
   wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality,
   with elevated left atrial pressure. There is a very small pericardial
   effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) from the operating room (OSH) after a fall and subsequent burr hole/evacuation for a subdural hematoma. The patient was found to be in AFib upon arrival and managed with intravenous metoprolol. The patient is currently on bipap and extubated post-burrhole/evacuation.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, MI, CABG, AFib, CHF with EF 15% post-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and sleep apnea on bipap. The patient's cardiac risk factors include diabetes and CAD.

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA) 81 mg, carvedilol 12.5 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, furosemide (Lasix) 1-5 mg/hr IV drip infusion, titrated to negative 50-100cc/hr, heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every third day, phenytoin sodium extended-release 100 mg orally every third day, ondansetron 4 mg IV every eight hours as needed for nausea, and hydralazine 10 mg IV every six hours if systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160 mmHg.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's social history includes being retired, living with his wife, and being independent in activities of daily living (ADLs). The patient has a history of smoking in the past. The patient's family history is noncontributory for CAD.

Laboratory data shows an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.8 thousand/mm^3, hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 43-48.3%, platelet count of 289-293 thousand/mm^3, creatinine (Cr) levels of 1.8-2.1 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 87-200 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium (K+) levels of 3.5-4.8 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) levels of 138-142 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl-) levels of 98-100 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination findings include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 131/86 mmHg to 97/78 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on bipap, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg. The patient is alert and oriented to person but disoriented to place and time. The patient has irregularly irregular heart rhythm, full neck veins, and mild crackles in the bases of the lungs bilaterally. The patient also has staples in"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). He presents with symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a subdural hematoma, which has been evacuated. He is experiencing volume overload, likely due to his atrial fibrillation and poor forward flow. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on diuretics to manage this condition. Additionally, the patient has a history of sleep apnea and is being treated with CPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and fluid overload suggest worsening heart failure.
   - Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of future arrhythmias, which can lead to hemodynamic instability.
   - Coronary artery disease progression: Given the patient's history of CAD and CABG, there is a risk of further blockages or ischemic events.

2. Neurological Complications:
   - Recurrence of subdural hematoma: Although the patient had a subdural hematoma that was evacuated, there is still a risk of recurrence due to his anticoagulation therapy and potential bleeding risk.
   - Cognitive decline: The patient may be at risk of cognitive decline due to"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, atrial fibrillation, and subdural hematoma who presented with decompensation in baseline severe chronic systolic CHF. The patient was on bipap but was unable to tolerate it and was put on a face mask. The patient had apneic episodes lasting 40-45 seconds, tachypnea with grunting, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of 50 from 55, indicating respiratory distress. An echocardiogram (transthoracic echo) showed new twinkle artifacts (TWI) in leads V1-V5, suggestive of intracardiac echogenic focus, possibly related to device implantation. The patient's phenytoin level was subtherapeutic at 8.2 (normal range 9-11). The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count was elevated at 19.8 but trending down from 16.7. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. The patient's sodium (Na+) level was low at 130 mEq/L, and potassium (K+) level was high at 4.3 mEq"

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and subsequent hypoxic brain injury.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 114/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on bipap mask. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a paced rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), right pupil larger than the left and asymmetrically positioned downwards and to the right, full distal pulses bilaterally, and use of accessory muscles for breathing. The patient's neurological examination shows orientation to person, place, and month, but not date. Extremities are cool with dopplerable pulses, and no edema is present.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, slightly low sodium level of 134 mg/dL, normal potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, slightly elevated chloride level of 103 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate level of 26 mEq/L, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicating possible kidney dysfunction.

Radiology images and cardiac enzyme levels are also provided, but they are not mentioned in the given prompt.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, trauma, and underlying hypercoagulability state increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Surveillance for signs of DVT/PE and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation are recommended.

3. Central nervous system (CNS) complications: The patient's subdural hematoma may lead to further neurological deterioration. Monitoring for changes in mental status, motor function, and pupillary response is crucial.

4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and presence of PVCs indicate an increased risk for additional cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring and antiarrhythmic therapy may be required.

5. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Regular assessment"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of subdural hematoma, pulmonary embolism (PE), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions.

The patient experienced an acute event characterized by shortness of breath and increased apnea episodes. He was unable to tolerate bipap and required a face mask for respiratory support. His carbon dioxide levels improved slightly, but he remains tachypneic. A trans-thoracic echo was performed at 12:34 PM, which showed new twigs in V1-V5 with ventricular pacing, indicating possible ischemia. The patient's phenytoin level was subtherapeutic.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/88 mmHg to 95/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with bipap support. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 51%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, trending down from 19.8 K/uL to 16.7 K/uL. Other lab values include hemoglobin (Hct) at 43%, platelet count (Plt) at 263 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.9 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.04 ng/mL, blood glucose levels ranging from 87 mg/dL to 355 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances.

The patient has a history of subdural hematoma, PE, and CAD. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent acute event. He has not been on plavix/ASA for the past three days, and his antiepileptic medication has been switched from phenytoin to keppra.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening shortness of breath and apnea episodes.
2. Cardiac ischemia indicated by the new twigs in V1-V5 on the trans-thoracic echo.
3. Infection or sepsis indicated by the elevated WBC count.
4. Bleeding or hemorrhagic complications due to the history of subdural hematoma and potential anticoagulation therapy.
5. Metabolic disturbances indicated by the electrolyte imbalances and fluctuating blood glucose levels.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism recurrence.
7. Acute kidney injury or renal dysfunction indicated by the elevated creatinine levels.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcer complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He also has systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, atrial fibrillation, and a previous subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient presented with volume overload, which was clinically evident but not shown on the chest X-ray. He was initially managed with diuretics but developed worsening dyspnea, agitation, and tachycardia. His central venous pressure (CVP) increased from 9 to 16-18 mmHg. An EKG showed possible atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing. The patient's respiratory support included BiPAP, and his oxygen saturation remained at 95%. Physical examination revealed crackles bilaterally in the lungs, and laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and troponin T levels. The patient's condition is complicated by acute on chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, and a history of subdural hematoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and heart failure puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has a history of systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent burr hole evacuation for a subdural hematoma and is currently experiencing volume overload clinically, despite no change on chest X-ray. 

The patient's overnight events include becoming more dyspneic and agitated, with an attempt to restart lasix. The ABG values were skewed due to low oxygen levels. The patient's condition did not improve, so a lasix bolus was given. The patient continued to experience symptoms, including tachycardia and increased central venous pressure (CVP). An EKG showed no significant changes, suggesting possible atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing. The night nurse increased the lasix bolus and administered 500 mg of IV diuril, which worked overnight. An electrophysiologist was scheduled to interrogate the pacemaker, but the patient was too short of breath to proceed. Neurosurgery placed orders to start Plavix three days post-procedure and switch from dilantin to keppra.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 89/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced, and the CVP is elevated at 16-18 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2283 mL since 10 AM, with total inputs of 1023 mL and total outputs of 3306 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a bipap mask and is on IV fluids.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs, no significant leg edema, and staples in place on the left scalp. Neurological examination shows orientation to person and month but not year, with ability to move all four extremities spontaneously. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, agitation, tachycardia, and elevated CVP suggest fluid overload. The patient responded to lasix and diuril, indicating a positive response to diuresis. Continuing lasix gtt and monitoring CVP are important to prevent fluid overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia and EKG findings suggest atrial fibrillation. Increasing carvedilol and discussing with an outpatient cardiologist about anticoagulation therapy (Coumadin) are necessary to manage this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a neurosurgical procedure. The patient has a history of cardiac issues and is currently experiencing dyspnea, agitation, and tachycardia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/67 to 123/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on BiPAP. The patient's CVP is elevated at 16-18 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,023 mL and output of 3,306 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,283 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin, and dextrose. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of cardiac issues, along with the symptoms of dyspnea, agitation, and tachycardia, suggest potential cardiac complications. These could include arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute and the use of BiPAP indicate respiratory distress or compromised respiratory function. Potential complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic congestive heart failure (EF 15%), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a history of subdural hematoma with burr hole evacuation.

The patient's current condition includes symptoms of dyspnea, agitation, and tachycardia. The EKG shows no significant changes, with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on BiPAP.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 89/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including lasix, heparin sodium, and omeprazole.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, troponin-T) are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 2283 mL and the urine output is 3306 mL. The chest X-ray did not reveal any significant fluid overload."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who presented with systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 15%. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and has undergone burr hole evacuation for a subdural hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU due to volume overload and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient's symptoms of agitation, tachypnea, and tachycardia, along with elevated CVP, indicate fluid overload. The patient has already shown improvement with lasix gtt and bolus, as well as diuril. The plan is to continue lasix gtt with a goal UOP of 50-100 cc/hr, monitor CVP, and aim for an I/O balance of -1 to 1.5L for the day.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia is likely contributing to poor forward flow and further fluid overload. Increasing carvedilol to 25 mg and consulting with an outpatient cardiologist regarding the use of Coumadin are recommended.

3. Coronary Arteries: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG. Although the patient denies chest pain at this time, it is important to follow up with OSH hospital records for"

   Volume overload likely [**12-25**] IV fluids during surgery in the setting of
   having nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] and lasix held.
   .
   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Volume status improved today, but still volume

   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - change carvedilol to metoprolol for rate control with less
   antihypertensive effect and uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u) for neurosurgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No recent PCI, so can change Plavix to aspirin (if okay from
   neurosurgical perspective)
   - continue simvastatin
   - change carvedilol to metoprolol as above
   .
   #  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.6 today, still above recent
   baseline of 1.2. Likely prerenal from poor forward flow.
   - continue diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by his symptoms and fluid balance data. This can lead to worsening heart failure and pulmonary edema. Continuing diuresis with lasix is recommended to manage this condition.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia may be contributing to poor forward flow and further fluid overload. Metoprolol can be used for rate control, and Coumadin can be considered in 3 weeks after neurosurgical follow-up.

3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease post CABG. No recent PCI has been performed, so changing Plavix to aspirin (if approved by neurosurgery) can be considered. Simvastatin should be continued, and metoprolol can replace carvedilol for rate control.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated above the recent baseline. Prerenal azotemia due to poor forward flow may be the cause. Continuing diuresis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident. She presented for ASA desensitization prior to catheterization but was deferred due to contrast-induced nephropathy with creatinine (Cr) of 1.88 on readmission. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and subdural hemorrhage.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.6°C, heart rate 86 bpm, blood pressure 99/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated hematocrit, elevated platelet count, increased blood urea nitrogen, decreased creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure: Acute on chronic (due to hypertension and diabetes). Cr 1.9, baseline 1.1 in early [Month], after dye load was 1.6 on [12-25] contrast dye load and hypertensive emergency.

 MULTI LUMEN - STOP [**2109-2-6**] 12:00 PM
 EKG - At [**2109-2-6**] 03:21 PM
   Overnight Events:
   - his CVL was removed in the morning
   - he got 5 mg metolazone in addition to 500 mg of Diuril in the
   morning, as well as a 20 mg lasix bolus
   - in the afternoon patient looked increasingly worse- skin mottled,
   perioral cyanosis, low urine output, agitated; repeat electrolytes
   showed worsening renal function; ABG looked fine with good oxygenation,
   stable pH, although lactate was elevated to 2.7; CXR looked unchanged;
   EKG and cardiac enzymes unchanged
   - we stopped his diuretics
   - after much discussion we decided to give him back some fluids
   (thinking he was intravascularly dry from overdiuresis the last two
   days); we gave him 250 cc IV bolus x2 of normal saline
   - for his respiratory agitation, he got 0.5 mg IV morphine x2
   - we changed PO metoprolol to IV given that he was too agitated to
   tolerate pos; we think better rate control will improve his perfusion,
   and stopping the diuretics may allow us to increase his BB
   - with the fluids and morphine, he calmed down, UOP increased, and his
   overall clinical status improved
   - we obtained [**State 1198**] records from an admission in [**Month (only) 25**] that showed
   he was on dig 0.125 mg and has a questionable history of AF; he has not
   been treated with coumadin in the past
   - discharge meds per that admission [**Date range (1) 14020**]/[**2108**] are as follows: Lasix
   40 po bid, K-dur 10 mEq daily, simvastatin 40 daily, glyburide 10 [**Hospital1 **],

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and was found to have an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating heart failure exacerbation. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

24-hour events:
- The patient had a multi-lumen stop on 02/06/2109 at 12:00 PM.
- An EKG was performed on 02/06/2109 at 03:21 PM.
- The patient's central venous line (CVL) was removed in the morning.
- He received 5 mg metolazone in addition to 500 mg of Diuril in the morning, as well as a 20 mg lasix bolus.
- In the afternoon, the patient looked increasingly worse, with skin mottling, perioral cyanosis, low urine output, and agitation.

   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - STOP [**2109-2-6**] 12:00 PM
 EKG - At [**2109-2-6**] 03:21 PM
   Overnight Events:
   - his CVL was removed in the morning
   - he got 5 mg metolazone in addition to 500 mg of Diuril in the
   morning, as well as a 20 mg lasix bolus
   - in the afternoon patient looked increasingly worse- skin mottled,
   perioral cyanosis, low urine output, agitated; repeat electrolytes
   showed worsening renal function; ABG looked fine with good oxygenation,
   stable pH, although lactate was elevated to 2.7; CXR looked unchanged;
   EKG and cardiac enzymes unchanged
   - we stopped his diuretics
   - after much discussion we decided to give him back some fluids
   (thinking he was intravascularly dry from overdiuresis the last two
   days); we gave him 250 cc IV bolus x2 of normal saline
   - for his respiratory agitation, he got 0.5 mg IV morphine x2
   - we changed PO metoprolol to IV given that he was too agitated to
   tolerate pos; we think better rate control will improve his perfusion,
   and stopping the diuretics may allow us to increase his BB
   - with the fluids and morphine, he calmed down, UOP increased, and his
   overall clinical status improved
   - we obtained [**State 1198**] records from an admission in [**Month (only) 25**] that showed
   he was on dig 0.125 mg and has a questionable history of AF; he has not
   been treated with coumadin in the past
   - discharge meds per that admission [**Date range (1) 14020**]/[**2108**] are as follows: Lasix
   40 po bid, K-dur 10 mEq daily, simvastatin 40 daily, glyburide 10 [**Hospital1 **],
   carvedilol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 10 daily, Plavix 75 daily, omeprazole
   20 daily, aspirin 81 dialy, Novolin 70/30 ASDIR, digoxin 125 mcg daily

   Assessment and Plan
   72M h/o CAD s/p MI s/p CABG, systolic CHF (EF 15%) s/p ICD, atrial
   fibrillation s/p burr hole/evacuation for subdural hematoma with
   development volume overload clinically although no change on CXR.
   Volume overload likely [**12-25**] IV fluids during surgery in the setting of
   having nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] and lasix held.
   .
   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Volume status improved today, but still volume
   overloaded, requiring further diuresis.
   - continue lasix gtt at this time with goal I + O negative 2 L today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes during diuresis
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - change carvedilol to metoprolol for rate control with less
   antihypertensive effect and uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u) for neurosurgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No recent PCI, so can change Plavix to aspirin (if okay from
   neurosurgical perspective)
   - continue simvastatin
   - change carvedilol to metoprolol as above
   .
   #  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.6 today, still above recent
   baseline of 1.2. Likely prerenal from poor forward flow.
   - continue diuresis
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes during diuresis
   .
   # DM: Fasting hypoglycemia has resolved with decreased insulin dosing.
   - continue insulin NPH + Humalog sliding scale at current dose
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma s/p Burrhole/Evacuation: Neurologic exam stable.
   - neuro checks q4 hrs
   - appreciate neuro sx input
   - neurosurg f/u in [**12-26**] weeks as outpatient
   - per neurosurg,  continue Keppra for total 7 days. Stables will come
   out after total 10 days
   - repeat head CT this a.m.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He also has systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with symptoms of volume overload, including fluid retention, increased central venous pressure, and pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current condition is complicated by acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, subdural hematoma post burr hole evacuation, and sleep apnea. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. He also has poorly controlled blood glucose levels, which have led to episodes of hypoglycemia. 

The patient's medication regimen includes metoprolol, digoxin, furosemide (Lasix), K-dur, simvastatin, glyburide, carvedilol, lisinopril, Plavix, omeprazole, aspirin, Novolin 70/30 insulin, and Keppra. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 99/67 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to fluid overload"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has a reduced ejection fraction of 15%, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, atrial fibrillation, and subdural hematoma with evacuation. The patient presented with volume overload and worsening renal function. He was treated with diuretics, fluids, and morphine for agitation. The patient's condition improved after these interventions. The patient has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea.

Potential medical complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient still shows signs of volume overload despite diuretic therapy. This may lead to further respiratory distress, decreased cardiac output, and worsening renal function.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia could contribute to poor forward flow, worsening renal function, and fluid overload.
3. Acute on Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. This may require further management of fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as consideration for dialysis.
4. DM: The patient's fasting hypoglycemia has resolved but should continue to be monitored closely due to the risk of fluctuating blood sugar levels.
5. Subdural hematoma s/p Burrhole"

 EKG - At [**2109-2-6**] 03:21 PM
   Overnight Events:
   - his CVL was removed in the morning
   - he got 5 mg metolazone in addition to 500 mg of Diuril in the
   morning, as well as a 20 mg lasix bolus
   - in the afternoon patient looked increasingly worse- skin mottled,
   perioral cyanosis, low urine output, agitated; repeat electrolytes
   showed worsening renal function; ABG looked fine with good oxygenation,
   stable pH, although lactate was elevated to 2.7; CXR looked unchanged;
   EKG and cardiac enzymes unchanged
   - we stopped his diuretics
   - after much discussion we decided to give him back some fluids
   (thinking he was intravascularly dry from overdiuresis the last two
   days); we gave him 250 cc IV bolus x2 of normal saline
   - for his respiratory agitation, he got 0.5 mg IV morphine x2
   - we changed PO metoprolol to IV given that he was too agitated to
   tolerate pos; we think better rate control will improve his perfusion,
   and stopping the diuretics may allow us to increase his BB
   - with the fluids and morphine, he calmed down, UOP increased, and his
   overall clinical status improved
   - we obtained [**State 1198**] records from an admission in [**Month (only) 25**] that showed
   he was on dig 0.125 mg and has a questionable history of AF; he has not

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He also has a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 15%, atrial fibrillation, and a subdural hematoma that was evacuated via burr hole.

- The patient's current condition includes volume overload, which is likely due to excessive intravenous fluids received during surgery combined with the diuretic lasix being held. This has resulted in symptoms such as cold, clammy, mottled extremities, and an increase in creatinine levels.

- The patient's respiratory distress was managed with fluid boluses and morphine. Diuretics were stopped, and fluids were given back to the patient. The patient's overall clinical status improved after these interventions.

- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which contributes to his symptoms of poor forward flow and fluid overload. Rate control with metoprolol is being continued, and the possibility of anticoagulation with Coumadin is being considered in the future.

- The patient's coronary artery disease status post CABG is being managed with simvastatin and metoprolol. The possibility of changing Plavix to aspirin is being considered, pending neurosurgical"

   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Likely overdiuresed yesterday morning, as
   evidence by cold, clammy, mottled extremities and bump in creatinine.
   Responded well to fluid boluses as well as morphine for respiratory
   distress.
   - hold diuretics and fluids at this point and monitor I/O

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u)
   - attempt to touch base with neurosurgery re: anticoagulation
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No apparent h/o PCI, so can change Plavix to aspirin (if okay from

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure (EF 15%) post-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation post-burr hole/evacuation for subdural hematoma. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and sleep apnea.

The patient presented to the ICU with symptoms of volume overload clinically, although no change on chest X-ray. The volume overload is likely due to excessive intravenous fluids received during surgery in the setting of having nodal blocking medications and lasix held. The patient was overdiuresed the previous day, as evidenced by cold, clammy, mottled extremities, and an increase in creatinine. The patient responded well to fluid boluses as well as morphine for respiratory distress.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient is likely overdiuresed, so diuretics and fluids should be held at this point and monitored for input/output status. Central access may be considered if better fluid status measurement is needed. A repeat echo may be considered to evaluate cardiac function.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia is likely contributing to symptoms, resulting in poor"

 MULTI LUMEN - STOP [**2109-2-6**] 12:00 PM
 EKG - At [**2109-2-6**] 03:21 PM
   Overnight Events:
   - his CVL was removed in the morning
   - he got 5 mg metolazone in addition to 500 mg of Diuril in the
   morning, as well as a 20 mg lasix bolus
   - in the afternoon patient looked increasingly worse- skin mottled,
   perioral cyanosis, low urine output, agitated; repeat electrolytes
   showed worsening renal function; ABG looked fine with good oxygenation,
   stable pH, although lactate was elevated to 2.7; CXR looked unchanged;
   EKG and cardiac enzymes unchanged
   - we stopped his diuretics
   - after much discussion we decided to give him back some fluids
   (thinking he was intravascularly dry from overdiuresis the last two
   days); we gave him 250 cc IV bolus x2 of normal saline
   - for his respiratory agitation, he got 0.5 mg IV morphine x2
   - we changed PO metoprolol to IV given that he was too agitated to
   tolerate pos; we think better rate control will improve his perfusion,
   and stopping the diuretics may allow us to increase his BB
   - with the fluids and morphine, he calmed down, UOP increased, and his
   overall clinical status improved
   - we obtained [**State 1198**] records from an admission in [**Month (only) 25**] that showed
   he was on dig 0.125 mg and has a questionable history of AF; he has not
   been treated with coumadin in the past

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent burr hole evacuation for a subdural hematoma.

The patient presented to the ICU with volume overload clinically, although there were no changes on chest X-ray. The volume overload is believed to be due to excessive intravenous fluids received during surgery in the setting of nodal blocking medication and held diuretics. 

During the overnight period, the patient's condition worsened, with mottled skin, perioral cyanosis, low urine output, agitation, and elevated lactate levels. Repeat electrolytes showed worsening renal function, but arterial blood gas (ABG) looked fine with good oxygenation, stable pH, and an ABG of 7.50/42/113/29/8. Chest X-ray remained unchanged, and cardiac enzymes were unchanged as well.

To address these concerns, the patient's diuretics were stopped, and he was given intravenous fluid boluses. Morphine was administered for respiratory distress, and the patient's agitation improved with the fluids and morphine. The patient's overall clinical status improved.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on digoxin"

   recent subdural hematoma evacuation developed volume overload which
   responded to initial diuresis, but due to hypotension and cool clammy
   extremities, he required a fluid bolus to correct the volume
   depletion.    He is now improved but requiring CPAP for oyxygenation
   due to underlying sleep apnea.  Will continue to observe his mental

   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Likely overdiuresed yesterday morning, as
   evidence by cold, clammy, mottled extremities and bump in creatinine.
   Responded well to fluid boluses as well as morphine for respiratory
   distress.
   - hold diuretics and fluids at this point and monitor I/O
   - contine digoxin
   - continue to monitor fluid and respiratory status
   - consider central access if we feel we need a better measurement of
   his fluid status
   - consider repeat echo to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u)
   - attempt to touch base with neurosurgery re: anticoagulation
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No apparent h/o PCI, so can change Plavix to aspirin (if okay from
   neurosurgical perspective)
   - continue simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   #  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 2.1 today, recent baseline of
   1.2. Likely prerenal from poor forward flow with superimposed
   overdiuresis.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - holding further diuresis, as above
   - consider urine lytes if creatinine does not improve
   .
   # DM: Fasting hypoglycemia has resolved with decreased insulin dosing.
   - continue insulin NPH + Humalog sliding scale at current dose
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma s/p Burrhole/Evacuation: Neurologic exam stable.
   - neuro checks q4 hrs
   - appreciate neuro sx input
   - neurosurg f/u in [**12-26**] weeks as outpatient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 15%, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation, and recent subdural hematoma evacuation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient developed volume overload following surgery, which responded to initial diuretics but then became hypotensive and cool clammy, indicating potential overdiuresis. Fluid boluses were administered to correct the volume depletion, resulting in improvement. He is now requiring CPAP for oxygenation due to underlying sleep apnea. His mental status remains variable, but his family reports intermittent periods of lucidity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient may continue to experience fluctuations in fluid status, leading to either overdiuresis or volume depletion. Close monitoring of input/output balance, renal function, and respiratory status is essential.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia may contribute to poor forward flow and further fluid overload. Rate control with metoprolol should be continued, and consideration for anticoagulation can be discussed with neurosurgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He also has a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and has been equipped with a biventricular pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient recently underwent a burr hole evacuation for a subdural hematoma. 

The patient presented with volume overload, which responded to initial diuresis but then required a fluid bolus to correct volume depletion. He is currently requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for oxygenation due to underlying sleep apnea. 

The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, as he is disoriented to place and time but can follow commands. His respiratory effort is assisted by the use of a bipap mask, and he exhibits irregular respirations. His peripheral pulses are palpable, and extremities are warm and well perfused. 

Laboratory results indicate renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.1 today compared to a recent baseline of 1.2. Other lab values show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Plan:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor forward flow and overdiures"

   He was having occaissional PVCs with some runs of NSVT. His IV
   metoprolol was changed to p.o and increased in dose from 50q8 to 75 TID

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and has undergone implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and ICD. The patient recently suffered from a subdural hematoma that required surgical evacuation.

24-hour events:
- Repeat head CT showed no change in the subdural hematoma with residual acute hemorrhage.
- Aspirin and Plavix were discontinued.
- The patient underwent speech and swallow evaluation and was placed on a thin liquid/ground solid diet with supervised feeding.

   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Likely overdiuresed yesterday morning, as

   Responded well to fluid boluses as well as morphine for respiratory
   distress.
   - hold diuretics and fluids at this point and monitor I/O
   - start digoxin
   - continue to monitor fluid and respiratory status
   - consider central access if we feel we need a better measurement of

   - consider repeat echo to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u)
   - attempt to touch base with neurosurgery re: anticoagulation

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and has undergone implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and ICD. The patient recently suffered from a subdural hematoma, which was evacuated via burr hole. He presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure, volume overload, and respiratory distress. His mental status is fluctuating, and he requires CPAP for oxygenation due to underlying sleep apnea.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF)
   - The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 2.1, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely due to poor forward flow and overdiuresis.
   - Hold diuretics and fluids, monitor intake and output.
   - Start digoxin for cardiac function improvement.
   - Continue to monitor fluid and respiratory status.
   - Consider central access for better measurement of fluid status.
   - Consider repeat echo to evaluate cardiac function.

2. Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive
   - The patient's low left ventricular ejection fraction (15%) suggests restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control and uptitrate as needed.
   - No Coumadin for now; can consider this in "

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cardiac bypass surgery. He has a low ejection fraction of 15% and has undergone implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and ICD. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and recently underwent a burr hole evacuation for a subdural hematoma. 

Key findings from the note include:
1. The patient has persistent left subdural extra-axial collection with some residual acute hemorrhage, as shown on a repeat head CT.
2. The patient's aspirin and Plavix were discontinued.
3. The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow therapy and placed on a thin liquid/ground solid diet, crushed/pureed pills, and supervised feeding.
4. The patient experienced occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). His IV metoprolol was changed to oral and increased in dose. He was also restarted on digoxin.
5. The patient had a urinary output of approximately 20 cc/hr since midnight, following the administration of 250 ml boluses twice.
6. The patient's respiratory status requires CPAP support due to underlying sleep apnea.
7. The patient demonstrated signs of volume overload, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cardiac bypass surgery. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and has undergone placement of a biventricular pacemaker and ICD. The patient recently had a subdural hematoma evacuation. He presents with volume overload, which responded to initial diuresis but then developed hypotension and cool, clammy extremities, indicating potential volume depletion. The patient is currently on CPAP for oxygenation due to underlying sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient's symptoms suggest overdiuresis, leading to fluid overload. This is supported by cold, clammy, mottled extremities and an increase in creatinine levels. Fluid boluses have been given, and diuretics have been held. Monitoring intake and output, starting digoxin, and considering central access for better fluid status assessment are recommended.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia is likely contributing to his symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload. Metoprolol will be continued for rate control, and Coumadin may be considered in 3 weeks after a neurosurgical follow-up. Attempting to contact neurosurgery regarding anticoagulation is advised.

","Summary:
The patient is a 112.1 kg adult admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of renal failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and subdural hemorrhage. The patient has been on various medications including Dilantin, Heparin Sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/77 to 121/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on BiPAP mask. The patient is receiving respiratory support and is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, infection, or certain medications. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels will be necessary to assess the progression of renal failure and determine appropriate management strategies.

2. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: This condition refers to a weakened and stiffened heart muscle, which can lead to impaired cardiac function. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels will help assess the effectiveness of cardiac function. Management may involve optimizing fluid balance and cardiac support as needed.

3. Subdural hemorrhage: This refers to bleeding between the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He also has a biventricular pacemaker ICD and recently underwent subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient developed volume overload, which responded to initial diuresis but subsequently resulted in hypotension and cool, clammy extremities due to overdiuresis. The patient continues to require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.4, which is improved from a peak of 2.8 during this admission and a recent baseline of 1.2. It is likely prerenal due to poor forward flow and superimposed overdiuresis.

2. Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive: The patient's low LVEF of 15% suggests restrictive cardiomyopathy, which can lead to poor forward flow and contribute to renal failure.

3. Subdural Hematoma (SDH): The patient had a recent subdural hematoma evacuation, and a repeat head CT showed residual acute hemorrhage. However, the neurosurgery team does not believe that this is contributing to the worsening apnea.

4. Fluid Overload"

   - uptitrated metoprolol from 75TID to 100TID due to HR in 100s from 90s

   -Neurosurgery felt that his worsening apnea was not related his
   subdural hematoma and stated that the [**Location (un) **] of a residual acute
   hemorrhage meant that it was resolving. They did not recommend any
   changes to his medications. If he did not have his multiple

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He also has a biventricular pacemaker, ICD, and recently had a subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient developed volume overload, which responded to diuresis, but then experienced hypotension and cool, clammy extremities due to overdiuresis. He requires continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for central sleep apnea and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity. The patient's current issues include congestive heart failure/fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and subdural hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive Heart Failure/Fluid Overload: The patient's euvolemic state suggests that he is currently not experiencing fluid overload. However, there is a risk of fluid overload due to the previous episodes of overdiuresis and subsequent hypotension. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is crucial.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia is likely contributing to his symptoms and poor forward flow, leading to further fluid overload. Titration of metoprolol may be necessary to control the heart rate.

   # CHF/Fluid Overload: Likely overdiuresed yesterday morning, as
   evidence by cold, clammy, mottled extremities and bump in creatinine.
   Responded well to fluid boluses as well as morphine for respiratory
   distress.
   - hold diuretics and fluids at this point and monitor I/O
   - contine digoxin
   - continue to monitor fluid and respiratory status
   - consider central access if we feel we need a better measurement of
   his fluid status
   - consider repeat echo to evaluate cardiac function

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   - continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as needed
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u)
   - attempt to touch base with neurosurgery re: anticoagulation
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No apparent h/o PCI, so can change Plavix to aspirin (if okay from
   neurosurgical perspective)
   - continue simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   #  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 2.1 today, recent baseline of

   - consider urine lytes if creatinine does not improve
   .
   # DM: Fasting hypoglycemia has resolved with decreased insulin dosing.
   - continue insulin NPH + Humalog sliding scale at current dose
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma s/p Burrhole/Evacuation: Neurologic exam stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also has a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and has undergone implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and ICD. The patient recently had a subdural hematoma evacuation.

The patient's current condition includes volume overload, which initially responded to diuresis but then developed hypotension and cool clammy extremities, requiring fluid boluses. He continues to require CPAP for oxygenation due to underlying sleep apnea. His mental status remains variable, but there are intermittent periods of lucidity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient likely experienced overdiuresis, resulting in cold, clammy, mottled extremities and an increase in creatinine. This was corrected with fluid boluses and morphine for respiratory distress. The plan is to hold diuretics and fluids, monitor intake/output, continue digoxin, monitor fluid and respiratory status, consider central access for better fluid status measurement, and consider a repeat echo to evaluate cardiac function.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia is likely contributing to the patient's symptoms, leading to poor forward flow and further fluid overload. The plan is to continue metoprolol"

   developed volume overload which responded to initial diuresis, and two
   days ago developed hypotension and cool clammy extremities, which
   responded to fluid boluses.  He now appears euvolemic.  He has had
   increasing levels of apnea
 and it has been difficult to ascertain
   whether this is do to central or obstructive reasons.   We will ask
   neurologic input as to whether this is a central event and to help
   evaluate his recent changes in mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CABG, LVEF of 15%, biventricular pacemaker ICD, and recent subdural hematoma evacuation. He developed volume overload, which responded to diuresis, but then experienced hypotension and cool clammy extremities, which were managed with fluid boluses. The patient continues to require CPAP and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to prerenal causes such as poor forward flow and overdiuresis.
2. Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive: The patient has a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, which may indicate restrictive cardiomyopathy. This can lead to symptoms like volume overload and heart failure.
3. Subdural Hematoma (SDH): The patient had a recent subdural hematoma evacuation. Although the neurologic exam is stable, there is a concern for residual acute hemorrhage, which may contribute to worsening apnea.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, likely contributing to poor forward flow and fluid overload. Metoprolol should be uptitrated to control the heart rate.
5. Coronaries: The patient has a history of CAD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and subdural hemorrhage. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 98/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a BiPAP mask and has been given a bolus of 250 cc due to low urine output. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and a low albumin level. The patient is on multiple medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may progress to further deterioration if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of fluid balance and daily urine output is essential.
2. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: This condition affects the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to potential complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and ensuring adequate preload and afterload conditions are maintained is crucial.
3. Subdural hemorrhage: The presence of a subdural hematoma can increase intracranial pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, who presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue. Upon arrival, he was found to be unresponsive and was intubated due to respiratory failure. Initial laboratory results showed acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated levels of BUN and creatinine. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuating mental status and neurological findings consistent with a possible subdural hematoma. He required aggressive fluid resuscitation and was placed on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for renal support. The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy and an irregular heart rhythm. His respiratory status has improved with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient remains critically ill with ongoing monitoring in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of cardiac function, development of new neurological deficits, and infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further deterioration of renal function: The patient already has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function if the underlying cause is not addressed or if complications such as sepsis or drug toxicity occur.
2. Worsening of cardiac function: The patient's cardiac status is concerning with evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy. There is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He also has a biventricular pacemaker, ICD, and recently underwent subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient developed volume overload, which responded to diuretics, but then experienced overdiuresis and required fluid boluses. He continues to require CPAP for central sleep apnea and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity.

The patient's current medical conditions include congestive heart failure (CHF)/fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a subdural hematoma post-burrhole evacuation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF/fluid overload due to inadequate diuresis or fluid overload, further deterioration of renal function, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation leading to poor forward flow, and potential hypoglycemic episodes. The patient's sleep apnea needs to be managed with continued use of BiPAP.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening CHF/fluid overload, changes in mental status, and adjustments in medication dosages. Regular neurologic exams should be performed to assess the subdural hematoma, and renal function should"

","The patient is a 72-year-old man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and has a biventricular pacemaker ICD. He also has a recent history of subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient developed volume overload, which responded to initial diuresis but resulted in subsequent hypotension and cool clammy extremities. He continues to require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to underlying central sleep apnea and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity.

The patient's current medical conditions include congestive heart failure (CHF)/fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) post CABG, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a subdural hematoma post burrhole evacuation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF/fluid overload, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, further deterioration of renal function, poorly controlled DM, and potential neurological issues related to the subdural hematoma.

Overall, the patient requires careful management of his CHF/fluid overload, titration of beta-blocker therapy for atrial fibrillation, monitoring and management of renal function, adjustment of insulin therapy for DM, and follow-up with neurosurgery regarding the subdural hematoma."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man s/p CABG, LVEF = 15%, biventricular pacemaker
 ICD and
   recent subdural hematoma evacuation developed volume overload which
   responded to initial diuresis with subsequent hypotension and cool
   clammy extremities [**12-25**] overdiuresis which responded to fluid boluses.
   Pt continues to require BIPAP (has underlying central sleep apnea) and
   has variable MS, with periods of lucidity.
   .
   # CHF/Fluid Overload:  Pt previously overdiuresed, now euvolemic to
   hypovolemic. Given small fluid boluses overnight [**12-25**] decreased UOP.
   - continue PRN small fluid challenges for oliguria
   - continue digoxin.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Tachycardia likely contributing to patient
   symptoms, resulting in poor forward flow and further fluid overload.
   Pt noted to be more tachycardic with agitation.
   - continue to uptitrate metoprolol as needed vs uptitrating dig
   - no Coumadin for now; can consider this in 3 weeks (after neurosurg
   f/u)
   - continue ASA for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p CABG. Pt denies any chest pain at this time.
   - No apparent h/o PCI, so changed Plavix to aspirin
   - continue simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   #  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr slightly continues to trend
   upward, now 3.4. Likely prerenal from poor forward flow with
   superimposed overdiuresis. Increased Hct also supports notion that
   patient is intravascularly volume-depleted.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - continue small fluid boluses for oliguria
   .
   # Increased anion gap: Could be from lactic acidosis in setting of poor
   perfusion versus build-up of uremic toxins in setting of rising
   creatinine.
   - check venous lactate
   - small (250 cc) IV boluses as needed
   .
   # DM: Fasting hypoglycemia has resolved with decreased insulin dosing.
   Pt noted to have low AM blood sugars.
   - will decreased PM insulin dose
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma s/p Burrhole/Evacuation: Neurologic exam stable.
   - neuro checks q4 hrs
   - appreciate neuro sx input
   - neurosurg f/u in [**12-26**] weeks as outpatient
   - per neurosurg,  continue Keppra for total 7 days. Staples will come
   out after total 10 days
   - repeat head CTshowed residual acute hemorrhage. Per neurosurgery this
   is resolving and is not contributing to worsening apnea
   - can consider EEG, per neuro recs
   .
   # Sleep Apnea: BiBAP overnight and when napping

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11131**] dated [**2109-2-11**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   D/C noted >30 min.  Patient to be transferred to [**Hospital 2408**] hospital
   today.  Will communicate directly with MD there since there are still
   open issues e.g. CHF, AF that require more management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and has a biventricular pacemaker ICD and recent subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient developed volume overload which responded to initial diuresis, followed by hypotension and cool clammy extremities. Subsequently, the patient experienced overdiuresis, which responded to fluid boluses.

The patient requires BIPAP due to underlying central sleep apnea and has variable mental status with periods of lucidity. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient was previously overdiuresed, now euvolemic to hypovolemic. Small fluid boluses were given overnight, which decreased urine output. Small fluid challenges should be continued for oliguria, and digoxin should be continued.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has tachycardia likely contributing to poor forward flow and further fluid overload. Metoprolol should be uptitrated as needed versus uptitrating digoxin. No Coumadin for now, but it can be considered in 3 weeks after neurosurgical follow-up. ASA should be continued.

3. CORONARIES: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease post CABG. He denies any chest pain"
