   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 HEART BLOCK, COMPLETE (CHB)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis.
   Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   - continue transvenous pacing
   - EP taking patient to lab for possible procedure today
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - am EKG
   - f/u tsh, spep/upep
   - ECHO to eval for cardiomyopathy
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol.  DDx includes propofol
   effect, bradycardia, hypovolemia; would also consider pericardial
   tamponade given pacer wire placement, Sepsis, and adrenal
   insufficiency.  PE less likely.  Has stable aortic stenosis.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - attempt to place central line to monitor CVP
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - check ECHO
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - cover empirically for infection
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test to r/o adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - received low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Pt has not
   produced urine.  Likely Atn caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.
   - renal consult
   - spin urine
   - kidney U/S
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - continue prednisone at current dose
   - continue allopurinol
   - will hold colchicine pending creatinine check
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test as above

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. The patient was transferred for management of third-degree AV block.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Complete Heart Block: The patient has an unclear etiology of complete heart block, which may be related to coronary ischemia. It is important to continue transvenous pacing and take the patient to the electrophysiology (EP) lab for a possible procedure today. Follow-up with cardiac enzymes and obtain an electrocardiogram (EKG).

2. Hypotension: The patient was hypertensive upon arrival and levophed was initiated during intubation and propofol administration. Differential diagnosis includes propofol effect, bradycardia, hypovolemia, pericardial tamponade, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. Perform IV fluid bolus PRN, attempt to place a central line to monitor central venous pressure (CVP), wean pressors as tolerated, check echocardiogram (ECHO), and obtain blood, urine, and sputum cultures. Cover empirically for infection and perform adrenal stimulation test to rule out adrenal insufficiency.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 HEART BLOCK, COMPLETE (CHB)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis.
   Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   - continue transvenous pacing
   - EP taking patient to lab for possible procedure today
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - am EKG
   - f/u tsh, spep/upep
   - ECHO to eval for cardiomyopathy
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol.  DDx includes propofol
   effect, bradycardia, hypovolemia; would also consider pericardial
   tamponade given pacer wire placement, Sepsis, and adrenal
   insufficiency.  PE less likely.  Has stable aortic stenosis.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - attempt to place central line to monitor CVP
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - check ECHO
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - cover empirically for infection
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test to r/o adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - received low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status

   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Pt has not
   produced urine.  Likely Atn caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.
   - renal consult
   - spin urine

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to bradycardia and asystole, and it is likely that they aspirated gastric contents through the endotracheal tube, leading to the development of pneumonitis or pneumonia. The respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of hypotension, bradycardia, and aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypertensive but developed hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or pericardial tamponade. The low blood pressure is likely due to a combination of factors including hypovolemia, bradycardia, and possible septic shock.

3. Complete heart block: The patient has complete heart block, which may be related to coronary ischemia. This condition requires ongoing transvenous pacing, and there is a possibility of an EP procedure to address the heart block.

4. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient has not produced urine since admission, and their baseline creatinine level is 1.8. This suggests acute kidney injury, likely caused by hypoperfusion of the kidneys. Renal consult and further investigations are needed to manage this condition.

5. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with DVT in the left lower extremity and likely had a PE. They were"

","Summary:
The patient is a female with unknown chief complaint, who has been in the ICU since [**2181-4-30**]. She underwent several procedures including a temporary pacer placement, trans thoracic echo, and arterial line insertion. The patient's overnight events include low blood pressure in the 80s-90s systolic, inability to wean off levophed, question of mediastinal widening on chest X-ray, trace effusion on bedside echo, and administration of empiric antibiotics and dexamethasone. She is currently on multiple infusions and medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The patient has rales at the bases bilaterally and 2+ pitting edema at the ankles. Her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, troponin T, lactate, and liver enzymes. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute heart block, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is increased, and there are rales at the bases bilaterally. These findings suggest a potential respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or infection.
2. Complete Heart Block (CHB): The patient has been diagnosed with CHB, which is a serious cardiac condition that requires prompt management to maintain adequate heart function"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, specifically acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and complete heart block (CHB). 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 101/47 to 139/57 mmHg, heart rate between 80 and 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT and AST), kidney function (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), and cardiac enzymes (troponin T). Additionally, the patient has an elevated lactate level, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and low levels of magnesium and phosphate.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including an arterial line, central venous catheter, temporary pacemaker, and endotracheal tube for mechanical ventilation. They are receiving several medications, including norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis on
   echo.  Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   Yesterday had pacemaker leads screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   Troponin elevated and trending down
   - continue pacing and await permanent PM when stable
   - am EKG
   - f/u tsh, spep/upep
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol. Received IVF but not
   responsive initially.  Over the last 24 hrs levophed has since been
   weaned.  His initial hyotension was not from tampenade (confirmed by
   echo) and was likely from sepsis verus cardiogenic shock vs adrenal
   insufficiency.  Propofol may have also contributed.  Central line
   placed.
   - continue cipro/zosyn (Cefepime was stopped [**5-1**])
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - monitor CVP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - cover empirically for infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia. RSBI was 102 this
   am
   - attempt extubation today
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now
   - talk with EP about restarting hep gtt (likely tomorrow)
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Likely Atn
   caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.  Pt now producing small amount of
   urine.
   - follow urine output
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - increase PO prednisone to 10 mg (for stress dose)
   - continue allopurinol
   - will hold colchicine pending creatinine check
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now
   - start PO when extubated
   - consider S and S
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, holing Coumadin and hep as above s/p
   pacemaker placement yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent DVT/PE on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. The patient was transferred for management of third-degree AV block.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has an unclear etiology for his complete heart block, but it may be related to coronary ischemia. There is a risk of further complications if the pacing and permanent pacemaker placement do not stabilize the heart rhythm.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypertensive on arrival and required initiation of levophed. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially if the cause is sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring CVP and providing IVF bolus PRN will help manage this condition.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and likely aspirated gastric contents. This increases the risk of developing pneumonitis/pneumonia. Attempting extubation today and following sputum cultures will help monitor and manage this complication.

4. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with DVT in the left lower extremity and also has a probable PE. There is a risk of further thromboemb"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis on
   echo.  Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   Yesterday had pacemaker leads screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   Troponin elevated and trending down
   - continue pacing and await permanent PM when stable
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - am EKG
   - f/u tsh, spep/upep
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol. Received IVF but not
   responsive initially.  Over the last 24 hrs levophed has since been
   weaned.  His initial hyotension was not from tampenade (confirmed by
   echo) and was likely from sepsis verus cardiogenic shock vs adrenal
   insufficiency.  Propofol may have also contributed.  Central line
   placed.
   - continue cipro/zosyn (Cefepime was stopped [**5-1**])
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - monitor CVP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - cover empirically for infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - received low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Pt has not
   produced urine.  Likely Atn caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.
   - renal consult
   - spin urine
   - kidney U/S
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - continue prednisone at current dose
   - continue allopurinol
   - will hold colchicine pending creatinine check

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. He was admitted for management of third-degree AV block.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has an unclear etiology for the complete heart block, which may be related to coronary ischemia. Troponin is elevated and trending down. Pacing and follow-up cardiac enzymes, EKG, TSH, and SPEP/UEP are planned.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypertensive on arrival but later developed hypotension, which was not due to tamponade. The cause is likely sepsis versus cardiogenic shock versus adrenal insufficiency. Levophed has been weaned, and the patient is receiving IV fluids as needed. Central line placement has been done.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of bradycardia and asystole. He likely aspirated gastric contents through the endotracheal tube, leading to pneumonitis/pneumonia. Current ventilator settings will continue, and sputum cultures will be obtained.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and first-degree AV block. He was transferred for management of third-degree AV block, which is a complete heart block. This condition can result in a slow or irregular heartbeat and may require the placement of a permanent pacemaker.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypertensive on arrival but required levophed due to intubation and propofol administration. There was initial unresponsiveness to intravenous fluids, and levophed has since been weaned. The patient's initial hypotension may be attributed to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Central line placement has been done, and further monitoring of blood pressure and response to fluids is necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to bradycardia and asystole. It is likely that the patient aspirated gastric contents through the endotracheal tube, leading to potential pneumonitis or pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and attempts at extubation can be made today.

4. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and also has a probable pulmonary embol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.

   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis on
   echo.  Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   Yesterday had pacemaker leads screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   Troponin elevated and trending down
   - continue pacing and await permanent PM when stable
   - f/u cardiac enzymes
   - am EKG
   - f/u tsh, spep/upep
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol. Received IVF but not
   responsive initially.  Over the last 24 hrs levophed has since been
   weaned.  His initial hyotension was not from tampenade (confirmed by
   echo) and was likely from sepsis verus cardiogenic shock vs adrenal
   insufficiency.  Propofol may have also contributed.  Central line
   placed.
   - continue cipro/zosyn (Cefepime was stopped [**5-1**])
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - monitor CVP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - cover empirically for infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - received low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Pt has not
   produced urine.  Likely Atn caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.
   - renal consult
   - spin urine
   - kidney U/S

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, along with a recent diagnosis of third-degree AV block. This is a serious condition that requires management and possible pacemaker placement.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypertensive but has since developed hypotension, which has required the initiation of vasopressor support (Levophed). The cause of hypotension is likely related to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring and continued management of blood pressure is essential.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to bradycardia and asystole. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia given the gastric contents aspirated through the endotracheal tube. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover potential infections.

4. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine is elevated at 1.8, and he has not produced urine. This suggests acute kidney injury, likely due to hypoperfusion. Renal consult and further diagnostic tests are needed to evaluate and manage this condition.

5. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and also has a"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 12333**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD
   on:[**2181-5-3**] 15:42 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and a first-degree AV block. This has led to the implantation of a pacemaker. However, the etiology of the complete heart block is unclear, and further evaluation may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypertension but later developed hypotension, which was initially unresponsive to intravenous fluids. Pressors were initiated during intubation and propofol administration. The hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, adrenal insufficiency, or the effects of propofol. It is important to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to bradycardia and asystole. However, the patient was successfully extubated yesterday. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is essential.

4. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.8, indicating impaired renal function. It is likely that acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys is contributing to the acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of urine output and regular assessment of renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, but likely from conduction
   problems from old age/calcium deposits.  [**2181-5-1**] had pacemaker leads
   screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   - continue pacing and await permanent PM when stable (contact EP to let
   know he is doing well)
   - am EKG
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol. Received IVF but not
   responsive initially.  Pressors have since been weaned.  His initial
   hyotension was not from tampenade (confirmed by echo) and was likely
   from cardiogenic shock vs adrenal insufficiency vs Propofol.  Sepsis
   unlikely given no fever or white count.  Central line placed.  Urine
   and sputum no growth, blood cx still pending but NGTD.
   - consider stopping antibiotics
   - IVF bolus PRN
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, but likely from conduction
   problems from old age/calcium deposits.  [**2181-5-1**] had pacemaker leads
   screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   - continue pacing and await permanent PM when stable
   - am EKG
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol. Received IVF but not
   responsive initially.  Pressors have since been weaned.  His initial
   hyotension was not from tampenade (confirmed by echo) and was likely
   from cardiogenic shock vs adrenal insufficiency vs Propofol.  Sepsis
   unlikely given no fever or white count.  Central line placed.  Urine
   and sputum no growth, blood cx still pending but NGTD.
   - consider stopping antibiotics
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - monitor CVP

   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Successfully extubated yesterday.

   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.

   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Likely Atn
   caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.  Pt now producing urine, but
   creatinine still elevated.
   - follow urine output

   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - increase PO prednisone to 10 mg (for stress dose) however, pt not
   taking good PO yet
   - change to IV steroids until taking PO
   - continue allopurinol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels. This may indicate liver dysfunction or injury.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which could be due to cardiogenic shock, adrenal insufficiency, or an adverse reaction to propofol. The cause of the initial hypotension was not from tamponade, but further evaluation is needed.

3. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine level of 1.8, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient is producing urine, but the creatinine levels are still elevated.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to bradycardia and asystole. Although the patient was successfully extubated yesterday, close monitoring of respiratory function is necessary.

5. Complete heart block: The patient has a complete heart block, which is likely due to conduction problems from old age or calcium deposits. Temporary pacing has been initiated, and the patient awaits a permanent pacemaker when stable.

6. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and also has a probable pulmonary embolism (PE). Heparin therapy will be restarted today, and the patient will need to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent DVT/PE on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. He was admitted for management of third-degree AV block. The patient's current medical issues include complete heart block, recent DVT/likely PE, acute kidney injury/oliguria, hypertension, hematuria, dysphagia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and tophaceous gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient has an unclear etiology for his complete heart block, but it is likely due to conduction problems from old age/calcium deposits. He has had a pacemaker placed temporarily, but a revision by an electrophysiologist is planned today.
2. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a DVT in his left lower extremity and has a probable PE on V/Q scan. He was on heparin, but it was held for a procedure. He will need to restart Coumadin tomorrow (24 hours after PM internalization).
3. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.8, and he likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypoperfusion of the kidneys. He is now producing urine, and his"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, but likely from conduction
   problems from old age/calcium deposits.  [**2181-5-1**] had pacemaker leads
   screwed in with extrernal pacer.
   - to have revision by EP today
   - stop hep gtt
   - am EKG
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   -was on hep gtt, but holding for procedure
   - will need to restart Coumadin tomorrow (24 hrs after PM internalized)
   .
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria:  Baseline creatinine 1.8. Likely Atn
   caused by hypoperfusion of kidneys.  Pt now producing urine, and
   creatinine elevated but trending down.
   - follow urine output
   - trend creatinine
   - will consider dialysis if creatinine does not improve over the next
   few days
   .
   # Hypertension: was in the setting of increased stimulation last night
   by family.  Received hydralazine for BP 195/100.  Pressures became
   normotensive to 120s following this
   - may consider starting antihypertensive (after PM placement) if
   continues to have hypertension (such as amlodipine given renal
   problems)
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hematuria: Likely from trauma while on hep gtt.  Reportedly the
   patient had been tugging on his foley last night with supratheraputic
   hep gtt.
   .
   # dysphagia: Pt had trouble swallowing food and gagged/brought up food
   last night while family present.  Known to have baseline dysphagia and
   probably would prefer soft diet.  [**Month (only) 8**] have some difficulty s/p
   intubation.
   - Speech and swallow evaluation this am
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Successfully extubated [**2181-5-2**]

   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Antibiotics and central line D/C
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - continue PO prednisone to 10 mg (for stress dose)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. The patient was admitted for management of third-degree AV block and underwent placement of a pacemaker.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has a history of conduction problems, which likely contributed to the development of complete heart block. This condition can lead to bradycardia (slow heart rate) and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.

2. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and likely had a pulmonary embolism (PE). If the PE is not promptly treated, it can lead to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and even death.

3. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.8, indicating impaired renal function. Acute kidney injury can worsen renal function and may require dialysis if the creatinine levels do not improve.

4. Hypertension: The patient experienced an episode of severe hypertension, with a blood pressure reading of 195/100. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to cardiovascular complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent DVT/PE on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of third-degree AV block. The patient had a pacemaker lead screwed in with external pacing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient has been diagnosed with third-degree AV block and requires a pacemaker placement. This is an urgent condition that needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications related to cardiac rhythm abnormalities.

2. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and also has a probable pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been restarted on heparin therapy, and it will be necessary to restart Coumadin eventually.

3. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.8, and he likely experienced acute kidney injury due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys. The patient is now producing urine, and his creatinine level is elevated but stable. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels will be essential, and consideration should be given to dialysis if the creatinine does not improve over the next few days.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree (now intermittent
   third-degree) AV block, recent DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]),
   HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for
   management of third degree AV block.
   # Complete heart block
   Unclear etiology, but likely from conduction problems from old
   age/calcium deposits.  [**2181-5-1**] had pacemaker leads screwed in with
   external pacer. Now, yesterday, internalized on left, incision on right
   closed. Uncomplicated.
   - Restarted heparin drip now, along with coumadin
   - Actually in sinus rhythm again this a.m.
   # Recent DVT/likely PE
   Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower extremity, also with probable
   PE on v/q scan.
   - Restart heparin and Coumadin now that procedure completed
   #  Acute kidney injury/ oliguria
   Baseline creatinine 1.8. Likely Atn caused by hypoperfusion of
   kidneys.  Pt now producing urine, and creatinine elevated but trending
   down. Thus, dialysis not necessary given CrCl now.
   - follow urine output
   - trend creatinine
   # Hypertension
   Normotensive now, but hypertensive on one occasion overnight.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider starting antihypertensive, considering hydralazine and
   calcium channel antagonist
   - continue to monitor
   # Hematuria
   Likely from Foley trauma while on hep gtt.  Reportedly the patient had
   been tugging on his foley last night with supratheraputic hep gtt.
   # Dysphagia
   Pt earlier had trouble swallowing food and gagged/brought up food on
   [**5-3**], but now tolerating Pos with strict supervision for now.  Known to
   have baseline dysphagia and probably would prefer soft diet.  [**Month (only) 8**] have
   some difficulty s/p intubation.
   - Speech and swallow evaluation
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Successfully extubated [**2181-5-2**]
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Antibiotics and central line D/C
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - Continue PO prednisone to 10 mg (for stress dose)
   - Restart allopurinol
   - Will hold colchicine, given no active pain and pending improved renal
   function.
   FEN:
   - No IVF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, first-degree AV block, recent DVT/PE on coumadin, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and left below-knee amputation. He was transferred to the ICU for management of third-degree AV block. The patient has complete heart block, likely due to conduction problems from old age or calcium deposits. He had pacemaker leads screwed in with external pacing, and revision by EP is planned today.

The patient also has recent DVT/likely PE diagnosed around 04/24/2181, with a DVT in the left lower extremity and probable PE on V/Q scan. He was on heparin gtt but holding for procedure, and Coumadin will be restarted tomorrow (24 hours after PM internalization).

The patient experienced acute kidney injury/oliguria with baseline creatinine 1.8, likely caused by hypoperfusion of the kidneys. His urine output has improved, and creatinine is trending down. He will be monitored for further improvement, and dialysis will be considered if creatinine does not improve over the next few days.

The patient had hypertension in the setting of increased stimulation last night, and hydralazine was given for BP 195/100. Pressures became normotensive to 120s following this. Antihypertensive medication may be considered after pacemaker"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of complete heart block. The patient has a history of impaired physical mobility, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and complete heart block. The patient is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin, an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged complete heart block: The patient's complete heart block may lead to prolonged pauses in heart rhythm, potentially causing hemodynamic instability and decreased cardiac output.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This increases the risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and support. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. This can result in impaired metabolism and clearance of medications, increasing the risk of drug toxicity.
5. Infection: Although no significant growth was noted in the microbiology report, the patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, especially considering the use of indwelling lines and the presence of impaired immune function.
6. Deep vein throm"

He was transferred from another hospital for management of third-degree AV block. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient has an unclear etiology of third-degree AV block, likely due to conduction problems from old age/calcium deposits. He had pacemaker leads screwed in with an external pacer, which will need revision by the electrophysiology (EP) team today. He is also scheduled for an EKG.
2. Recent DVT/likely PE: The patient was diagnosed with a DVT in his left lower extremity and has a probable PE on a ventilation-perfusion scan. He was on heparin gtt but is holding for the procedure. He will need to restart Coumadin tomorrow (24 hours after PM internalization).
3. Acute kidney injury/oliguria: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.8, and he likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypoperfusion of the kidneys. His urine output has improved, and his creatinine is trending down. He will be followed for urine output and trends in creatinine."
