   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o HTN, anxiety, gout, who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with RUQ revealing cholecystitis
   with obstructing stone and CBD dilatation
   1) Cholecystitis: Likely the patient's pain a few weeks ago was also
   secondary to passing a gallstone.  Her symptoms, fever, and exam are
   all consistent with cholecystitis.  She is currently hemodynamically
   stable.  The patient's US showed CBD dilatation to 1.2 cm.
   - will treat with cipro/flagyl for cholecystitis
   - s/p ERCP yesterday with stone/pus removal, sphincterotomy
   - Will likely need cholecystectomy at some point once cholecystitis
   resolved
   - cont to trend LFTs
   - trial of clears for now
   - antiemetics, analgesics PRN
   - repeat lactate- likely elevated in the setting of intravascular
   volume depletion
   -f/u GI recs
   2)Hypotension.  Had held anti-hypertensive meds peri ERCP.  In ERCP
   suite pt became hypotensive in the setting of receiving propofol,
   dexmedetomidate. Temporarily placed on peripheral neo for procedure and
   transfer to floor.  Bolused throughout the day and evening with
   improvement, MAPs ~60-65.  UOP stayed around 30cc/hour.  Pt without
   complaint.  Mentating well the entire time.  Ddx includes shock due to
   transient bacteremia from ERCP/cholangits, hypovolemia, or result of
   sedatives, although less likely given persistence of hypotension.
   Given pt's fluid responsiveness, opted not to place CVL.  Unable to
   obtain repeat lactate last night, will repeat this am.
   - Bolus for MAP <60, UOP <30
   -If not fluid responsive will need CVL for possible pressors
   -Continue antibtiotics, follow up cultures
   -continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   3) Anxiety
   - ativan PRN, try to use sparingly
   4) F/E/N:
   - NPO for now
   - IVFs
   - replete lytes PRN
   5) PPx:
   - pneumoboots; hep sc after ERCP
   - PPI
   6) Access: PIV
   7) DNR/DNI per patient- will d/w  daughter as well
   8) Contact: Daughter
   9) DISPO: pending ERCP, will monitor post procedure then likely to

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, anxiety, and gout. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and was found to have cholecystitis with an obstructing stone and common bile duct (CBD) dilation. 

The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, during which stones and pus were removed, and a sphincterotomy was performed. She received dexmedetomidate and propofol, which caused her blood pressure to drop to the 60s-70s. She was then transferred to the GI suite, where she was given 3 liters of fluids and showed improvement in urine output and systolic blood pressure.

The patient's allergies include ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. She is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Her vital signs as of 07:20 AM on 03/17/2193 include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a current temperature of 34.8°C (94.7°F), a heart rate of 73 bpm (60-86), a blood pressure of 110/46 mmHg (62-114/33-73), a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (15-26), and an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, anxiety, and gout. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and was found to have cholecystitis with an obstructing stone and CBD dilatation. She underwent an ERCP procedure, where stones and pus were removed, and a sphincterotomy was performed. The patient received dexmedetomidate and propofol, resulting in hypotension. She was given fluids and improved, but remained hypotensive with a MAP of 60-65. Her UOP stayed around 30cc/hour. She is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals minimal tenderness in the RUQ, diminished breath sounds on the left posterior base, and distal pulses present. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and oriented to person, place, and time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient likely had cholangitis based on her symptoms, fever, and exam findings. She underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy, removal of stones, and passage of purulent fluid. She is now bacteremic with GNRs, likely from the biliary source. She will be treated with cipro/flagyl for cholangitis/bacteremia for a planned 14-day course.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with admission with cholangitis and obstructing stone on
   CBD now s/p ERCP with stone removal and sphincterotomy with post
   procedure hypotension complicating procedure.  This is clearly related
   to bactermia and with significant SIRS and sepsis following procedure.
   This is in evidence by rising WBC count as well as positive blood
   culture results.  With procedure completed and obstruction relieved we
   have reasonable hope that drainage of primary insult will contribute to
   rapid resolution of sepsis.
   1)Sepsis-Secondary to biliary source and has GNR
s seen on blood
   cultures-
   -Continue Cipro/Flagyl
   -IVF reasonable with current volume status appropriate.
   -Maintain po intake
   2)Cholelithiasis-
   -Drainage completed
   -Will need eval for CCY in future
   -ABX as above and will be extended to two week course given significant
   bacteremia
   3)Oliguria
This is in the setting of sepsis but  with relative
   stability of creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with cholangitis and an obstructing stone in the common bile duct. She underwent an ERCP procedure to remove the stone and perform a sphincterotomy. Post-procedure, she experienced hypotension and oliguria, which are likely due to bacteremia and sepsis caused by the procedure. The patient's blood cultures were positive for Gram-negative organisms.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis secondary to a biliary source, with GNR seen on blood cultures. It is crucial to continue the current antibiotic regimen (Cipro/Flagyl) and maintain IVF with appropriate volume status.

2. Cholelithiasis: The drainage of the primary insult has been completed, but there is a need for future evaluation for possible choledocholithiasis. Antibiotics should be extended to a two-week course due to significant bacteremia.

3. Oliguria: This is present in the setting of sepsis, but the patient's creatinine levels remain relatively stable. It is important to closely monitor renal function and provide appropriate supportive care.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring in the ICU with continued aggressive management of sepsis and ongoing evaluation for potential complications related to her underlying condition and the recent ERCP procedure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, anxiety, and gout. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and was diagnosed with cholecystitis due to an obstructing stone and common bile duct dilatation. The patient underwent an endoscopy and ERCP procedure, where stones and pus were removed, and a sphincterotomy was performed. She received dexmedetomidate and propofol, resulting in stable blood pressure. The patient is now on clears diet, continuing antibiotic therapy for another 7 days, and has shown improvement in urine output and systolic blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cholangitis: Since the patient had cholecystitis with obstructing stone and CBD dilatation, there is a possibility of developing cholangitis if the biliary tree remains infected.
2. Sepsis: The presence of pus in the common bile duct indicates an infection, which can lead to sepsis if it spreads to other parts of the body.
3. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's amylase and lipase levels are within normal range, there is still a potential risk of developing pancreatitis due to the ERCP procedure.
4. Bleeding: As the patient underwent sphincterotomy during the ERCP, there is a risk of post-procedural bleeding.
5. Hepatic complications: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST)"

   with obstructing stone and CBD dilatation
   1) Cholangitis: Likely the patient's pain a few weeks ago was also
   secondary to passing a gallstone.  Her symptoms, fever, and exam are
   all consistent with cholangitis.  S/p ERCP with sphincterotomy, removal
   of stones and passage of purulent fluid.  Pt now bacteremic with GNRs,
   likely biliary source.  Marked Leukocytosis with 10% bandemia
   - will treat with cipro/flagyl for cholangitis/bacteremia for planned
   14 day course after negative blood cx
   - s/p ERCP with stone/pus removal, sphincterotomy, f/u GI recs
   - hold off CCY per surgery recs
   - cont to trend LFTs, all trending down
   - trial of clears yesterday, advance today
   - antiemetics, analgesics PRN
   2)Hypotension.  Had held anti-hypertensive meds peri ERCP.  In ERCP
   suite pt became hypotensive in the setting of receiving propofol,
   dexmedetomidate. Temporarily placed on peripheral neo for procedure and
   transfer to floor.  Bolused throughout the day and evening with
   improvement, MAPs ~60-65.  UOP stayed around 30cc/hour.  Pt without
   complaint.  Mentating well the entire time.  Ddx includes shock due to
   transient bacteremia from ERCP/cholangits, hypovolemia, or result of
   sedatives, although less likely given persistence of hypotension.
   Given pt's fluid responsiveness, opted not to place CVL.  Unable to
   obtain repeat lactate last night, repeat this am improved, encouraging
   data that pt not ischemic.
   - Bolus for MAP <60, UOP <30
   - start low dose lopressor
   -Continue antibtiotics, follow up cultures
   3) Atrial fibrillation
   - new onset, had 4.5 sec pause with amiodarone, had 2 sec pause prior
   to starting amiodarone. Spoke with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2430**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2431**] her outpatient
   cardiologist who would like to opt for rate control, hold off on
   anticoagulation given she has recent infection on top of borderline LAE
   to account for going into afib. Will d/c amiodarone and start low dose
   lopressor.
   4) F/E/N:
   - trial of advancing diet
   - IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN
   5) PPx:
   - pneumoboots; will hold hep SC for platelets <100
   - PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, anxiety, and gout. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which were found to be caused by cholecystitis with an obstructing stone and CBD dilatation. She underwent an ERCP procedure where stones and pus were removed, and a sphincterotomy was performed. The patient experienced hypotension during the procedure and required bolusing with fluids. She also developed atrial fibrillation, likely secondary to the recent infection. The patient's current medications include antibiotics for cholangitis/bacteremia, antiemetics, and analgesics as needed. Her diet is being advanced to clears, and she is receiving IV fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with cholangitis, including pain, fever, and bacteremia with Gram-negative rods (GNRs), likely from the biliary source. She will be treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for a planned 14-day course after negative blood cultures.
2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during the ERCP procedure, possibly due to transient bacteremia from cholangitis or hypovolemia. She was given boluses of fluids, and her condition improved. A differential diagnosis includes shock, hypovolemia, or the effect of sedatives.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient"
