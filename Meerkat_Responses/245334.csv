   39-year-old woman with pmh of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, s/p
   2 kidney transplants and a double kidney and pancreas transplant in
   [**2187**] with EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Associated B-cell CNS Lymphoma: Initially diagnosed by biopsy in
   the setting of altered mental status.  Currently receiving cycle 2 of
   Methotrexate with leucovorin.
   - leucovorin rescue started on the onc floor per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**]
   - alkalinizing urine with bicarb (follow urine PH) and initiating CVVH
   for MTX clearance
   - F/u MTX levels as directed by onc.
   - antiemetics with zofran prn
   - f/u Onc recs
   # Psych: Preominant memory impairment and emotional lability, and
   agitation. Seems unchanged since prior admission. Most likely [**12-24**]
   lymphoma.
   - Continued reassurance.
   - Ativan prn for anxiety and insomnia.
   - SW consult for coping.
   # Acute renal failure s/p kidney transplant: Creatinine increased from
   previous admission.  differential includes ? not taking meds vs ? mtx
   effect vs other cause of ARF.  Now that she has been on HD, Cr level
   has been lowered to 0.8. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no longer an
   issue.
   - per Transplant recs: restarted CellCep today; continue prednisone 4mg
   daily
   - cont sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH.
   # Anemia: Hct of 24.7 which is within her recent baseline for Hct in
   the mid to high 20's.  Likely secondary to recent chemo.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue ferrous sulfate.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival.
   - continue home regimen of atenolol 100 mg po daily and amlodipine 5mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a medical history of type I diabetes, two kidney transplants, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant due to crescentic glomerulonephritis. She also has EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma. She is currently in the ICU for acute renal failure post kidney transplant, and her creatinine level has improved from 2.9 on admission to 0.9 today after hemodialysis and CVVH. She is being managed for various conditions including methotrexate toxicity, anemia, hypertension, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent history of acute renal failure post kidney transplant indicates compromised kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and continued management with hemodialysis and CVVH will be necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

2. Methotrexate toxicity: The patient is undergoing treatment for EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma with methotrexate. Methotrexate toxicity can lead to bone marrow suppression and liver toxicity. Monitoring of blood counts and liver enzymes will be important to detect any signs of toxicity.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 25, near baseline, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring of Hct levels and timely transfusion when necessary will help manage anemia.

4. Hypertension: The patient's BPs are stable in the 120s-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has chronic renal failure and lymphoma. The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has received a bicarb infusion to protect renal tubules. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/94 to 127/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the CVVH treatment.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and shows no signs of acute distress or anxiety. The patient's cardiovascular system is normal, with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory system is clear with no crackles or wheezes. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no edema in the lower extremities, and the patient does not exhibit cyanosis or clubbing. The patient's neurological examination is also within normal limits.

   39-year-old woman with type I diabetes, s/p 2 kidney transplants and a
   double kidney and pancreas transplant secondary to crescentic
   glomerulonephritis, now also with EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma.
   # Acute renal failure s/p kidney transplant:
   Creatinine 2.9 on admission, but 0.9 today after hemodialysis and after
   having started CVVH.  Possible that kidneys were further injured by
   methotrexate.  Has some chronic renal insufficiency w the transplant
   kidneys.  Now that she has been on HD, Cr level has been lowered to
   0.8. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no longer an issue.  CVVH until
   methotrexate level <0.1
   - continue on CellCept, per transplant recs; continue prednisone 4mg
   daily
   - cont sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6 and monitor urine for pH >7.5
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH.
   - free calcium low
 stopped citrate w CVVH
   # EBV-Associated B-cell CNS Lymphoma:   Just received cycle 2 of
   Methotrexate with leucovorin.  [**Last Name (un) **] how many cycles of methotrexate
   are planned.
   - continue leucovorin rescue, which was started on floor per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**]
   - alkalinizing urine with bicarb (follow urine PH) and initiating CVVH
   for MTX clearance
   - F/u MTX levels as directed by onc.
   - monitor blood counts
   - antiemetics with zofran prn
   - f/u Onc recs
   # Psych: emotional lability, and agitation. Thought to be secondary to
   lymphoma.
   - Continued reassurance.
   - Ativan prn for anxiety and insomnia.
   - SW consult for coping
pt had refused SW consults in past in the ICU.
   - talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] about possibility of doing HD multiple times rather
   than CVVH b/c pt wanted to leave against medical advice this AM
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 25, near baseline.  Likely secondary to recent
   chemo.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue ferrous sulfate.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   # Hypertension: BPs stable in 120s-150s.
   - continue home regimen of atenolol 100 mg po daily and amlodipine 5mg
   daily
   # Diabtes type 1 s/p pancreas transplant: Patient does not require
   insulin as an outpatient since her transplant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a medical history of type I diabetes, two kidney transplants, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant due to crescentic glomerulonephritis. She also has EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma. The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure following kidney transplant, as indicated by an admission creatinine level of 2.9, which has improved to 0.9 after hemodialysis and CVVH. Her pancreas is functioning well, eliminating the need for insulin. The patient is undergoing treatment for EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma with methotrexate and leucovorin. She is also being managed for hypertension, anemia, and potential complications related to her current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels prior to hemodialysis indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, along with ongoing management through CVVH.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable in the 120s-150s. It is crucial to continue monitoring blood pressure and adjust the antihypertensive medication regimen as needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable at 25, near baseline. Further evaluation and management of anemia should be pursued, considering the recent chemotherapy treatment.
4. Psychiatric Issues: The patient displays emotional lability and agitation"

   Assessment and Plan
   39-year-old woman with type I diabetes, s/p 2 kidney transplants and a
   double kidney and pancreas transplant secondary to crescentic
   glomerulonephritis, now also with EBV-associated B-cell CNS lymphoma.
   # Acute renal failure s/p kidney transplant:
   Creatinine 2.9 on admission, but 0.9 today after hemodialysis and after
   having started CVVH.  Possible that kidneys were further injured by
   methotrexate.  Has some chronic renal insufficiency w the transplant
   kidneys.  Now that she has been on HD, Cr level has been lowered to
   0.8. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no longer an issue.  CVVH until
   methotrexate level <0.1
   - continue on CellCept, per transplant recs; continue prednisone 4mg
   daily
   - cont sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6 and monitor urine for pH >7.5
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH.
   - free calcium low
 stopped citrate w CVVH
   # EBV-Associated B-cell CNS Lymphoma:   Just received cycle 2 of
   Methotrexate with leucovorin.  [**Last Name (un) **] how many cycles of methotrexate
   are planned.
   - continue leucovorin rescue, which was started on floor per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**]
   - alkalinizing urine with bicarb (follow urine PH) and initiating CVVH
   for MTX clearance
   - F/u MTX levels as directed by onc.
   - monitor blood counts
   - antiemetics with zofran prn
   - f/u Onc recs
   # Psych: emotional lability, and agitation. Thought to be secondary to
   lymphoma.
   - Continued reassurance.
   - Ativan prn for anxiety and insomnia.
   - SW consult spoke with family, appears emotional lability has been
   long standing issue
   - started citalopram 10mg daily
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.4, near baseline.  Likely secondary to
   recent chemo.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue ferrous sulfate.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   # Hypertension: BPs stable in 120s-150s.
   - continue home regimen of atenolol 100 mg po daily and amlodipine 5mg
   daily
   # Diabtes type 1 s/p pancreas transplant: Patient does not require
   insulin as an outpatient since her transplant.
