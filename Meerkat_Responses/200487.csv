She has a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous pansensitive Klebsiella infection. The patient is currently on antibiotics (levofloxacin), receiving nebulizers, high-dose steroids, oxygen supplementation, and being monitored for influenza. The patient also has leukocytosis, which may be stress or steroid-induced.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates the need for continuous monitoring due to her underlying COPD and current exacerbation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: Given the patient's history of pansensitive Klebsiella infection and current antibiotic treatment, there is a possibility of new or resistant infections developing, especially considering the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin prophylaxis, which carries a risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient's coagulation profile is altered.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses that need to be addressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and tested positive for respiratory syncytial viral antigen (RSV). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/60 mmHg to 148/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination revealed mild respiratory distress, poor air movement throughout with scattered rhonchi, and upper airway congestion. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer level of 402 ng/mL. Imaging revealed no evidence of acute intrathoracic process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including respiratory distress and leukocytosis, along with the presence of RSV, raise concerns for pneumonia. The positive viral culture for RSV supports this possibility.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation, as indicated by the need for BiPAP and CPAP/PSV, suggest the potential for acute respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. The patient is being treated in the ICU and is receiving various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's pre-existing COPD and the acute exacerbation, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or respiratory failure.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of corticosteroids or other medications.
4. Glycemic Control: Maintaining normal blood glucose levels is important to prevent complications like hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Fluid Balance: Monitoring fluid intake and output is crucial to avoid fluid overload or dehydration.
6. Renal Function: Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to detect any abnormalities early and prevent potential kidney damage.
7. Infection: The patient is at increased risk for infections due to ICU admission, invasive procedures, and compromised immune system.
8. Neurological Complications: Given the patient's age and underlying conditions, there is a possibility of neurological complications such as stroke or seizures"

   .
   # COPD exacerbation - +RSV on viral culture. No obvious infiltrate.
   Will continue on abx  however given her chronic steroids and risk to
   develop superimposed bacterial infection.  Continues to require
   intermittent BiPAP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and positive RSV on viral culture. She required intermittent BiPAP and had low urine output this morning, so she was given an IVF bolus. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 133/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, other ICU medications, and antibiotics. She has an elevated white blood cell count and her blood cultures showed gram-positive rods and cocci in pairs. The patient's laboratory results indicate a slightly low hemoglobin level and elevated potassium levels. She also has leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to steroids. The patient's physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia, and her peripheral vascular examination was not assessed. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and experienced a STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. She is currently being managed with aspirin and an ACE inhibitor. The patient is also hypertensive and is being treated with verapamil and an ACE inhibitor as tolerated. She has a history of COPD exacerbation and is at risk for developing superimposed bacterial infection due to chronic steroid use. The patient requires respiratory support"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, which have led to an acute exacerbation. The patient required reintroduction of BIPAP due to dyspnea. The patient has allergies to Albuterol and is on prophylactic Heparin Sodium. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient received various infusions and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and requirement of BIPAP suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of gram-positive rods and cocci in the sputum gram stain indicates a potential bacterial infection, which could lead to pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place due to the patient's immobility and risk factors for DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is on prophylactic stress ulcer medication due to the risk associated with ICU stay.
6. Nosocomial infection: The patient is at risk of acquiring other hospital-acquired infections due to their prolonged ICU stay.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The patient required BiPAP for dyspnea and had low urine output with poor oral intake, so intravenous fluids (IVF) were given.

Medical Complications:
1. RSV Infection: The patient has an active RSV infection, which is a common respiratory virus that can cause severe respiratory distress in individuals with underlying lung diseases such as COPD.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is currently in an acute exacerbation phase. This is indicated by her dyspnea and low oxygen saturation levels. COPD exacerbations can be triggered by viral infections like RSV.

3. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive in the emergency department when BiPAP was initiated. This may be due to preload dependence, possibly secondary to hypovolemia. The patient's blood pressure has been maintained and tolerated BiPAP on two occasions overnight.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has a rapid heart rate (tachycardia), likely secondary to respiratory distress. There is a low likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to a negative D-dimer test, good reasons for dyspnea, gradual onset of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She presented with an acute exacerbation of her COPD, which was confirmed by a positive respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test and multi-organ involvement in her sputum. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics (levofloxacin), nebulizers, high-dose steroids, oxygen supplementation, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) as needed. She also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is not currently on beta-blockers. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated D-dimer levels. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation, along with low oxygen saturation and crackles/wheezes in her chest, suggest a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and prompt intervention, such as increased oxygen supplementation or intubation, may be necessary.
2. Infection: The positive RSV test and leukocytosis indicate a potential respiratory infection. Close monitoring of her sputum culture and antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent or treat any secondary infections.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD puts her at risk for cardiac complications, especially considering her current tachycardia and hypotension. Monitoring her heart rhythm and cardiac enzymes is crucial to detect any cardiac events.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized and critically ill, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures like low molecular weight heparin should be continued to prevent DVT formation.
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical condition increases the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors should be administered to prevent gastric ulcers.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper oral hygiene, elevation of the head of the bed, and regular chest physiotherapy can help prevent this complication."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. She presents with an acute exacerbation of COPD, requiring intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support due to labored breathing and productive sputum. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (Levofloxacin), bronchodilators (Atrovent and Mucomyst nebs), and guaifenesin for mucolysis. High-dose steroids and Bactrim prophylaxis are also being administered chronically. Additionally, the patient is on medications for coronary artery disease (ASA), hypertension (verapamil and ACE inhibitor), and has a preserved ejection fraction with moderate pulmonary hypertension as noted in a recent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, normal blood pressure, and slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains at 99% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, mild respiratory distress, bilateral crackles and polyphonic diffuse wheezes on auscultation, and clear lungs on BiPAP. Neurological"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 74 yo F with marked COPD admitted with COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # COPD exacerbation - +RSV on viral culture. No obvious infiltrate.
   Will continue on abx  however given her chronic steroids and risk to
   develop superimposed bacterial infection.  Continues to require
   intermittent BiPAP
   - q2-4 hour standing xopenex and atrovent nebs
   - high dose steroids, given 20mg chronic prednisone for burst and taper
   back to 20mg
   - continue levoflox for possible CA pna x 5 days
   - sputum for culture
   - pulmonary toilet
   - acapella
   .
   # Tachycardia - likely in the setting of respiratory distress. Very low
   likelihood for PE, given negative d-dimer, good reason for dyspnea,
   gradual onset of symptoms, no evidence of EKG changes. Gave IVF
   yesterday, but no real response. ?respiratory distress as a
   contributor. Continue rate control as BP tolerates today. HR stable
   - monitor
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotensive in ED with the addition of
   BiPAP. Suspicion is for preload dependence, likely secondary to
   hypovolemia. Currently maintaining pressures and tolerated BiPAP
   .
   # Leukocytosis - likely secondary to steroids, but diff is slightly
   left shifted which argues for continuing abx. Trend.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease s/p STEMI related to coronary vasospasm:
   continue aspirin. Not on beta blockade, continue acei as tolerated.
   .
   # Hypertension: Continue verapamil and acei as BP tolerates in AM.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, sips for now, can advance diet as
   tolerated with aspiration precautions
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; droplet precautions. Aspiration
   precautions. Bactrim ppx.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She is currently requiring intermittent BiPAP, and there is an indication of RSV infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. Her physical examination reveals respiratory distress, crackles, and wheezing in the lungs. The lab results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient has multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and a history of a STEMI. She is currently on various medications such as heparin, aspirin, verapamil, and ACE inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's need for intermittent BiPAP and the presence of respiratory distress suggests a potential risk for respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles and wheezing in the lungs, along with the detection of RSV, raises the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous STEMI puts her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic heparin, which indicates an increased risk for DVT, especially due to immobility in the ICU setting.
5. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's use of chronic steroids and the presence of leukocytosis may increase the risk for stress ulcer bleeding.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of BiPAP and potential intubation could lead to the development of VAP."

","Summary:
The patient, a 74-year-old female with marked COPD, was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and tested positive for RSV on viral culture. She is currently requiring intermittent BiPAP support, and her respiratory status is being closely monitored. She is also on high-dose steroids, levofloxacin, and atrovent/nebs for her respiratory condition. Other medical issues include tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease with a history of STEMI, hypertension, and malnutrition. The patient is under droplet precautions and has aspiration precautions due to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's COPD exacerbation and requirement for BiPAP support, there is a risk of respiratory failure if her respiratory status worsens.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive viral culture for RSV and is on antibiotics, indicating a risk of bacterial superinfection due to her chronic steroid use.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of STEMI and uncontrolled hypertension puts her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's prolonged immobilization and malnutrition, she is at risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Aspiration Pneumonia: With the patient's COPD and requirement for BiPAP, there is an increased risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of her COPD. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 132 beats per minute, blood pressure of 87/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP. The patient is receiving intermittent BiPAP support due to post-tussive respiratory distress. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values such as electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, crackles in the mid-inspiratory phase, and polyphonic diffuse bilateral wheezes. The patient has symmetric chest expansion and resonant percussion notes. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension (HTN), both of which are being managed with appropriate medications. 

The patient's condition has been stable with some improvement, although the patient still experiences mild dyspnea at rest. The current plan includes continuing bronchodilators and steroids, as well as considering short-acting narcotics before activity. The patient's ICU care involves"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted with a COPD exacerbation.
- The patient tested positive for RSV bronchiolitis, and the healthcare team decided to continue antibiotics due to chronic steroid use and the risk of developing a superimposed bacterial infection.
- The patient continues to require intermittent BiPAP for respiratory support.
- The patient is receiving nebulized treatments of xopenex and atrovent every 2-4 hours, as well as high-dose steroids, and levofloxacin for a possible community-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient is also undergoing pulmonary toilet with an acapella device.
- The patient has concerns regarding volume overload, as indicated by increased pulmonary vasculature on the chest X-ray. As a result, gentle diuresis has been initiated, with the goal of removing 500cc of fluid.
- The patient experienced tachycardia, which is likely due to respiratory distress. There is a low likelihood of a pulmonary embolism, given the negative d-dimer results and the absence of EKG changes. The patient received intravenous fluids yesterday but showed no significant response. Respiratory distress and anxiety are being considered as potential contributors to the tachycardia. Metoprolol and ativan are being continued.
- The patient previously experienced hypotension, but it has since resolved.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, admitted with a COPD exacerbation. She has been on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support and is currently on bronchodilators, antibiotics, and steroids. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with a previous ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is not on beta-blockers. She has leukocytosis, likely secondary to steroids, and hypotension, which is being managed with intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient is also at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stress ulcers, and is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and H2-blockers, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's COPD exacerbation and requirement for BiPAP suggest ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous STEMI, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics due to the risk of bacterial superinfection while on chronic steroids. There is a risk of developing healthcare-associated pneumonia or other infections.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of marked COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. The patient tested positive for RSV bronchiolitis and continues to require intermittent BiPAP support. 

The patient has been on various medications including high-dose steroids, levofloxacin, and xopenex/atrovent nebs. The medical team also started her on a gentle diuresis with lasix due to concerns of volume overload. Additionally, the patient is being treated for tachycardia, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease related to a previous STEMI, and for nutritional support. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 147/69 to 161/82 mmHg, heart rate between 89-132 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination revealed mild respiratory distress, crackles in the mid inspiratory area, wheezes, and poor air movement throughout.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated D-dimer. The patient's chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary vasculature.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of superimposed bacterial infection due to chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and requires intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support. She is currently on antibiotics (Levofloxacin) and other medications for mucolysis and bronchodilation. The patient also has anxiety, hypertension, and leukocytosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's acute exacerbation of COPD and RSV infection, there is a high risk of respiratory failure if the patient's lung function does not improve with treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of multi-organ sputum suggests a possibility of pneumonia, which could worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT formation.
5. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged intubation and use of medical devices can increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's critical illness and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD who was admitted with a COPD exacerbation. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring Bipap last night and showing signs of respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease and experienced a STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. 

24-hour events include the use of Bipap, administration of Lasix, and Ativan for anxiety and tachycardia. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low-grade fever, and low oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates ongoing fluid overload, as evidenced by the increased pulmonary vasculature on CXR. The patient has been diuresed well overnight, with a goal of removing 500 cc of fluid today.

The patient's lab results reveal leukocytosis, which has increased from 15 to 24 this morning, raising suspicion for an infectious source. Imaging shows patchy opacities in the left lung base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, suggestive of pneumonia and a small pleural effusion. The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive rods and pairs, as well as sparse growth of gram-negative rods.

1. COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis: The patient has mild consolidation on CXR, and a CT Chest has been ordered for further evaluation. Leukocytosis increased this morning, but"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of marked COPD who was admitted with a COPD exacerbation. The patient required BiPAP intermittently and has been on various medications including Lasix, Ativan, omeprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/81 to 163/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other parameters are within normal limits.

Imaging reveals patchy opacities in the left lung base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, which may represent pneumonia and a small pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, and there is no pneumothorax.

The assessment and plan include management for COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis, volume overload, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease, and other conditions. The patient is also on various prophyl"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute exacerbation of COPD. She presented with tenacious respiratory status, increasing white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on high-dose steroids, but her condition remains critical. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenacious and she has bibasilar crackles and polyphonic diffuse bilateral wheezes on lung examination. This suggests possible respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and acute exacerbation.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of new infiltrates on chest X-ray and increased white blood cell count raises the possibility of pneumonia. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and zosyn, if consolidation for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is present.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is being administered to prevent this complication.

4. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients.

5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, anxiety, and difficulty breathing. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/69 mmHg to 163/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 0 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with values ranging from 16.3 to 24.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 32.6 to 37.2%, normal platelet count (Plt) ranging from 279 to 322 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values include an elevated D-dimer level and abnormal electrolyte levels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbation. She was admitted with a respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) bronchiolitis and marked COPD exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she has leukocytosis, likely secondary to steroids. The patient is experiencing tachycardia, anxiety, volume overload, and potential coronary artery disease. She has been diagnosed with RSV infection and her chest X-ray shows possible left lower lobe consolidation. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The patient's electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are within normal limits. Her glucose level is also normal. The patient's medications include Omeprazole, Heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. She is currently on IV fluids and receiving respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and chest X-ray findings suggest a possible infectious process, such as pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if the CT scan shows consolidation.
2. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's history of COPD exacerbation and RSV infection, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and anxiety. She is currently in the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient has been receiving high-dose steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on bipap. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and polyphonic diffuse bilateral wheezes. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), increased creatinine levels, and decreased platelet count. Imaging shows some thromboembolic burden (TBM) with small left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation and widespread emphysema. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and RSV infection put her at risk for respiratory failure, which can be indicated by worsening respiratory rates, decreased oxygen saturation, and the need for increased respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of small LLL consolidation on imaging suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated or worsens, it can lead to further respiratory distress and systemic infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. She has multiorgan involvement in her sputum. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, and her white blood cell count is increasing. Imaging shows small left lower lobe consolidation and tuberculosis (TB) with emphysema. She has completed a course of levofloxacin antibiotics and is on a slow prednisone taper. Further sputum cultures are being sent, and she will continue with nebulized medications for mucolysis. The patient is also on scheduled BiPAP at night and non-invasive ventilation during the day. Her intake and output are being closely monitored. She is prescribed low-dose benzodiazepines for anxiety, beta-blockers for CAD/tachycardia, verapamil and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, and regular insulin for glycemic control. A pain consultation has been requested. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous, indicating a high risk for respiratory failure due to her acute exacerbation of COPD and RSV infection.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of small left lower lobe consolidation on imaging suggests the possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of burst sinus tachycardia after nebs this morning. The patient had been receiving non-invasive ventilation overnight. Metoprolol dose was given early with good effect. The patient's allergy is to albuterol. The patient had received Bactrim on 12/29/2161 and ceftriaxone on 12/31/2161. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted tachycardia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.6 F), heart rate of 103 bpm with a baseline of 74-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/50 mmHg to 152/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 inspirations per minute with a baseline of 17-42 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,337 mL with 68 mL given intravenously, an output of 600 mL via urine and 160 mL via blood products, resulting in a balance of 737 mL with a negative 92 mL.

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen at a FiO2 of 50%"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted with a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis and has evidence of emphysema on CT chest. She is currently receiving nebulized bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and RSV infection can lead to worsening respiratory function, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: The dependent left lower lobe opacities seen on imaging could indicate atelectasis or bacterial pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased leukocyte count, is necessary.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility, especially in critically ill patients, can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, should be implemented to reduce this risk.

4. Stress Ulceration: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Prophylactic measures, such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors, should be considered to prevent this complication.

5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's requirement for non-invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation and RSV bronchiolitis. She was admitted with a COPD exacerbation and tested positive for RSV on viral culture. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved breathing and decreased need for BIPAP support. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and receiving nebulized bronchodilators. 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection, which was started on CTX and awaiting culture results. She has a history of coronary artery disease with a previous STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD and RSV infection puts her at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of her COPD symptoms.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is currently being treated for a UTI with CTX, and further evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate course of treatment.
3. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous STEMI, there is a risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobile and has central venous catheters, which increases her risk for DVT.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's inability to sit up for examination suggests potential pressure ulcer development due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is suspected to have tuberculosis (TB) with tibial abscess. The patient's current condition is improving, but several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has COPD exacerbation with bibasilar crackles and wheezes. This indicates possible respiratory distress, which can lead to pneumonia or further deterioration of lung function.

2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for UTI, but there is no mention of the causative organism. It is crucial to complete the appropriate antibiotic course to prevent antibiotic resistance and ensure complete resolution of the infection.

3. Tuberculosis: Although the patient is suspected to have TB, the diagnosis is not confirmed yet. If the patient is indeed diagnosed with TB, it is important to initiate appropriate anti-TB treatment to prevent further complications and transmission.

4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, and her heart rate is slightly elevated. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and managing any associated risk factors, such as hypertension, is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications.

5. Anxiety and Emotional Distress: The patient is experiencing anxiety and emotional distress, which can impact her overall well-being and recovery"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD with multiorgan involvement in sputum. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation, and her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/59 to 152/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, which shows improvement. The flow sheet data indicates that the patient has received various medications including heparin sodium, ceftriaxone, metoprolol, and steroids. She has also undergone chest X-rays on multiple occasions.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range, while the glucose levels have been fluctuating. Other lab values such as potassium, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, and INR are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include tachycardia, anxiety, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible tuberculosis (TBM). The patient is on a slow prednisone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted with a COPD exacerbation and RSV bronchiolitis. The patient has shown improvement in their pulmonary condition, breathing comfortably on examination and off bipap support. However, they still require intermittent bipap support. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which they are being treated with ceftriaxone. Additionally, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease post-stenting for a STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. They are on aspirin and metoprolol for this condition. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, which improved with metoprolol. The patient's recent lab results indicate leukocytosis and an elevated D-dimer level. Imaging studies reveal no clear infiltrate on chest CT, consistent with severe emphysema. The patient's medical plan includes continued treatment for COPD exacerbation, UTI, and monitoring for potential complications such as volume overload, tachycardia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending above."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation and RSV bronchiolitis.
- The patient was admitted with COPD exacerbation and tested positive for RSV on viral culture.
- The patient has shown improvement in their pulmonary condition, breathing comfortably off BIPAP.
- The patient's leukocytosis from yesterday is likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), for which antibiotics were started.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows no clear infiltrate and is consistent with severe emphysema.
- The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (HCT), as well as normal potassium (K+) and creatinine (Cr) levels.
- The patient's sputum culture shows multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora and budding yeast with pseudohyphae.
- The patient's urine culture is positive for yeast with over 100,000 organisms/mL.
- The patient's current medications include Advair, prednisone, ceftriaxone, metoprolol, ativan, aspirin, and heparin.
- The patient's plan includes continuing nebs, antibiotics, and supportive care with O2, mucolytics, and aspiration precautions.
- The patient's disposition is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He is currently on BIPAP, but was off it last night. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, as well as glucose levels. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer levels, normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 91 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 135/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's temperature is 36.3 C (97.4 F), and his blood rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of COPD and acute exacerbation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to compromised lung function and potential aspiration.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The elevated D-dimer levels suggest a possible clot formation, which could lead to DVT.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and elevated WBC count may increase the risk of developing ARDS.
4. Sepsis: The combination of elevated WBC count, fever, and potential infection could indicate sepsis, especially considering the patient's compromised immune system due to COPD.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm any specific complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/59 mmHg to 143/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient is receiving BiPAP support continuously.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests reveal normal creatinine (Cr) levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR). Other lab values, including D-dimer, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of allergy to albuterol and is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for shortness of breath requiring intermittent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 74-year-old female with marked COPD, was admitted with a COPD exacerbation. The patient had an RSV bronchiolitis and tested positive for RSV on viral culture. A chest CT showed no clear infiltrate, consistent with severe emphysema. The patient appeared better today, breathing comfortably on examination, and tolerated bipap well last night.

The patient has been prescribed several medications including xopenex and atrovent nebs every 2-4 hours, Advair, prednisone, and scheduled pm bipap. The patient completed a 5-day course of Levaquin and is now on CTX for leukocytosis and left base consolidation. A second 5-day course of CTX will be completed today. The patient is also undergoing pulmonary toilet and acapella treatments.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine analysis for yeast. The patient was initially started on CTX, but still remains on Levaquin. Concerns exist about a bacterial source, so the patient will complete a 5-day course of CTX. Additionally, the patient will start taking Fluconazole for 10 days to treat the yeast infection, as yeast was present in both urine and sputum cultures.

The patient experiences tachycardia after Zopenex, which improves with metoprolol. Monitoring will continue, and the patient will continue taking metoprol"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted with a COPD exacerbation. She was found to have RSV bronchiolitis and was placed on bipap overnight. The patient appears to be responding well to therapy, with slow improvement in breathing and less need for frequent nebulizer treatments. However, she remains in need of bipap during the day and at night. Secretions have increased over the past 24 hours.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), blood pressure of 127/59 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% face tent. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, continued expiratory wheezing, and minimal edema in the left upper extremity.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 31.6%, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation but improving left lower lobe air space disease. Sputum cultures from January 1 show opportunistic pathogens and yeast, while urine cultures also reveal yeast.

The plan includes continuing supportive care with oxygen, mucolytics, nebulizer treatments, and antibiotics. Steroid tapering will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, RSV, and previous DVT. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory distress. The patient requires BiPAP at night and has been on steroid taper. There are concerns about impaired skin integrity, anxiety, and potential complications such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with argatroban due to a suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs show low-grade fever, tachycardia, and mild respiratory distress. Fluid balance is even, and the patient is receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has multiple ecchymosis and abdominal wall hematoma, indicating potential skin integrity issues.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be indicative of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or another underlying condition.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating possible anemia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on systemic antico"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a thin, elderly, ill-appearing individual with multiple ecchymoses over the anterior chest and extremities.
- The patient has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently receiving Argatroban as systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, ranging from 329 to 32 K/uL.
- Hematocrit (Hct) levels have also been decreasing, ranging from 36.1% to 22.4%.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated at 23.8 K/uL.
- Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and lactic acid, along with low levels of haptoglobin.
- Imaging results indicate no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper or lower extremities.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation.
- The patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has a midline line in place for medication administration.

   seems to be peripheral destruction; differential diagnosis includes ITP
   vs. TTP vs. DIC vs. drug-induced thrombocytopenia.   Heparin dependent
   antibody is negative; HIT now seems unlikely given that platelets are
   <50K.

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted for a COPD exacerbation, now presenting with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The platelet count continues to trend downward, indicating peripheral destruction. Differential diagnosis includes ITP, TTP, DIC, and drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin-dependent antibody is negative, ruling out HIT. 

The patient is being continued on stress dose steroids, and potentially offending agents such as PPI, NSAIDs, and ASA are being discontinued. Anti-platelet antibody testing will be conducted, and the patient will be followed closely for evidence of bleeding. Hematology consult has been requested.

The patient's hematocrit has trended down from 41 to 22 since admission, suggesting hemolysis. Rare schistocytes seen on peripheral smear, as per Hematology consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, currently experiencing an acute exacerbation with RSV infection. She is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has developed thrombocytopenia with anemia, normal D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels, but evidence of hemolysis with high LDH, low haptoglobin, and dropping hematocrit. HIT is negative, and the patient has been started on argatroban for suspected HIT and stress dose steroids for possible ITP. Other possible diagnoses include TTP. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, requiring bipap support at night. There are multiple ecchymoses on the upper chest, left lateral thigh, and abdominal wall hematoma. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,271 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), slightly low calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, as well as elevated potassium. Imaging shows no deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but reveals superficial thrombosis in the left basilic/cephalic vein. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
2. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/66 mmHg to 86/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. Her temperature is slightly below normal at 35.2°C.

The patient has developed several medical complications including:

1. HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia): The patient has thrombocytopenia with anemia but normal D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. Despite negative HIT results, she is being treated with argatroban, which is an anticoagulant used in suspected or confirmed HIT. The differential diagnosis includes immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple ecchymoses (bruises) on her upper chest, left lateral thigh, and abdominal wall hematoma. This indicates potential impaired skin integrity and possible bleeding disorders.

3. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be related to her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD and RSV who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and required the use of bipap for support. The patient has developed anemia and thrombocytopenia, with normal D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, but evidence of hemolysis with high LDH, low haptoglobin, and dropping hematocrit. HIT has been ruled out, but the patient is on argatroban for suspected ITP or TTP. There is also evidence of superficial thrombosis, but no acute DVT in any limb. The patient is receiving stress dose steroids and has been switched to atovaquone due to concerns about medication interactions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 151/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's lungs are clear, and she has mild respiratory distress. There is no evidence of heart failure or peripheral edema. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. There are multiple ecchymoses on the upper chest, left lateral thigh, and abdominal wall hematoma. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented x 3. Laboratory results show"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient presented with dyspnea and was admitted to the ICU. The following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to trend downward despite stress-dose steroids administered. The most likely mechanism seems to be peripheral destruction. Differential diagnoses include ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. The negative heparin-dependent antibody makes HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) unlikely. Potentially offending agents such as PPI (proton pump inhibitor), NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), ASA (aspirin), and atorvastatin have been discontinued. Anti-platelet antibody has been sent, and the patient is being followed for evidence of bleeding.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has trended down from 41 to 22 since admission. Hemolysis is suggested by low haptoglobin levels and elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) >1500. Rare schistocytes seen on peripheral smear. Hematology"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted with a COPD exacerbation, now presenting with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to trend downward despite increased dose steroids. This could be due to peripheral destruction or medication-induced thrombocytopenia. Possible complications include bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has significantly decreased from 41 to 22 since admission. Hemolysis is suggested by low haptoglobin levels, elevated LDH, and rare schistocytes on peripheral smear. Complications could include worsening respiratory distress due to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and the need for blood transfusions.

3. COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis: The patient continues to require intermittent BiPAP support and is at risk for respiratory failure. Infections such as pneumonia or further exacerbations could complicate the situation.

4. UTI: The patient presented with a positive urinary tract infection (UTI) and has already been treated with ceftriaxone and levoquin. Complications could include worsening of the infection or the development of antibiotic resistance.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and experienced a STEMI related to"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F with marked COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation, now with
   thrombocytopenia and anemia
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets continue to trend downward, despite
   increased dose steroids.  Most likely mechanism seems to be peripheral
   destruction or medication induced.  Argatroban discontinued yesterday
   given no evidence of thrombosis.  PPI, ASA discontinued as well as
   other possible medication causes of thrombocytopenia: atorvastatin,
   fluoroquinolones, bactrim.   Heparin dependent antibody is negative;
   HIT now seems unlikely given that platelets are <50K.   S/p I bag
   platelets yesterday with bump, but then slow drift down.  No
   splenomegaly on u/s.  Antiplt antibody negative.  Now also growing GPCs
   in blood.
   -          decrease stress steroids to prednisone 60mg qday PO.
   -          minimize medications
   -          q 6 hrs CBC, LDH, and peripheral smear
   -          plt goal > 25,000 give ongoing evidence of abd wall
   bleeding.
   -          Continue to follow for evidence of bleeding
   -          Hematology Consult following
   -          treatment of GPCs as below
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit has trended down from 41 to 22, since admission.
   Haptoglobin <20 and elevated LDH > 1500 suggestive of hemolysis though
   rare schistocytes seen on multiple peripheral smears, as per Hematology
   consult.  While differential could still include hemolysis, the anemia
   could be from abd wall hematoma and hemolysis labs could be false
   positives from absorption of peripheral blood from hematoma.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to trend downward despite increased dose steroids. The most likely mechanism seems to be peripheral destruction or medication-induced. Argatroban was discontinued yesterday as there was no evidence of thrombosis. Other possible medication causes of thrombocytopenia, such as PPI, ASA, atorvastatin, fluoroquinolones, and bactrim, have also been discontinued. Heparin-dependent antibody is negative; HIT now seems unlikely given that platelets are <50K. The patient received one bag of platelets yesterday with a bump but then experienced a slow drift down. No splenomegaly on ultrasound was found, and antiplt antibody was negative. Now, growing GPCs in blood culture have been observed.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has trended down from 41 to 22 since admission. Haptoglobin <20 and elevated LDH > 1500 suggest hemolysis though rare schistocytes seen on multiple peripheral smears, as per Hematology consult. While differential could still include hemolysis, the anemia could be from abd wall hematoma and hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F with marked COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation, now with
   thrombocytopenia and anemia
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets continue to trend downward, despite
   increased dose steroids.  Most likely mechanism seems to be peripheral
   destruction or medication induced.  Argatroban discontinued yesterday
   given no evidence of thrombosis.  PPI, ASA discontinued as well as
   other possible medication causes of thrombocytopenia: atorvastatin,
   fluoroquinolones, bactrim.   Heparin dependent antibody is negative;
   HIT now seems unlikely given that platelets are <50K.   S/p I bag
   platelets yesterday with bump, but then slow drift down.  No
   splenomegaly on u/s.  Antiplt antibody negative.
   -          decrease stress steroids to prednisone 60mg qday PO.
   -          plt goal > 25,000 give ongoing evidence of abd wall
   bleeding.
   -          Continue to follow for evidence of bleeding
   -          Hematology Consult following
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit has trended down from 41 to 22, since admission.
   Haptoglobin <20 and elevated LDH > 1500 suggestive of hemolysis though
   rare schistocytes seen on multiple peripheral smears, as per Hematology
   consult.  While differential could still include hemolysis, the anemia
   could be from abd wall hematoma and hemolysis labs could be false
   positives from absorption of peripheral blood from hematoma.
   -            f/u Coombs antibody, cold agglutinin screen
   -            q 6 hour hematocrits
   -            serial hemolysis labs
   -            active type & screen; crossmatch 2 units
   -            transfuse to keep hct >25
   -            fractionate bilirubin
   -            check urine hemosiderin in consideration of intravascular
   hemolysis
   # COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis  - +RSV on viral culture.. CT
   Chest with no clear infilitrate, c/w severe emphysema. Continues to
   require intermittent bipap.
   -  q2-4 hour standing xopenex and atrovent nebs
   - Advair
   - Receiving stress dose steroids as above, with plan to taper back down
   to home dose of Prednisone 20mg daily
   - cont scheduled pm BIPAP and intermittent BiPAP PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, currently admitted to the ICU for RSV infection and thrombocytopenia. The patient is experiencing several medical complications that need attention. 

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is further complicated by medication-induced thrombocytopenia and possible HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The platelet count remains low despite platelet transfusions and high-dose steroids. The goal is to maintain a platelet count of at least 10,000.

2. Hemolysis: The patient is experiencing intra and extra vascular hemolysis, likely related to the abdominal wall hematoma. The LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels are increasing, indicating ongoing hemolysis. The transfusion goal is to maintain a hemoglobin level of at least 25%.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute and chronic respiratory failure, requiring the use of BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) support. Weaning off BiPAP should be done cautiously as tolerated.

4. ID (Infectious Disease): The patient has GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in her blood culture, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. However, there is a possibility of contamination, and repeat blood cultures are pending.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. She also has RSV infection and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient is in the ICU, requiring respiratory support with BiPAP at night.
- She has been experiencing hemolysis, both intra- and extra-vascular, likely related to an abdominal wall hematoma.
- Her platelet count remains low despite platelet transfusion.
- She has GPCocci in her blood and is currently on Vancomycin.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/50-164/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- Physical examination findings include mild respiratory distress, presence of crackles in the lungs, and ecchymoses on the skin.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
- The patient has been on multiple medications, including high-dose steroids, which have not improved her platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute and chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function, potentially requiring increased ventilatory support or intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F with marked COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation, now with
   thrombocytopenia and anemia
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets continue to trend downward, despite
   increased dose steroids.  Most likely mechanism seems to be peripheral
   destruction or medication induced.  Argatroban discontinued yesterday
   given no evidence of thrombosis.  PPI, ASA discontinued as well as
   other possible medication causes of thrombocytopenia: atorvastatin,
   fluoroquinolones, bactrim.   Heparin dependent antibody is negative;
   HIT now seems unlikely given that platelets are <50K.   S/p I bag
   platelets yesterday with bump, but then slow drift down.  No
   splenomegaly on u/s.  Antiplt antibody negative.  Now also growing GPCs
   in blood.

   Haptoglobin <20 and elevated LDH > 1500 suggestive of hemolysis though
   rare schistocytes seen on multiple peripheral smears, as per Hematology
   consult.  While differential could still include hemolysis, the anemia
   could be from abd wall hematoma and hemolysis labs could be false
   positives from absorption of peripheral blood from hematoma.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation.
2. The patient now presents with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and anemia.
3. The low platelet count has been trending downward despite increased dose steroids. Possible mechanisms include peripheral destruction or medication-induced thrombocytopenia.
4. Argatroban was discontinued as there was no evidence of thrombosis. Other medications causing thrombocytopenia (PPI, ASA, atorvastatin, fluoroquinolones, bactrim) have also been discontinued.
5. Heparin-dependent antibody is negative, making HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) unlikely.
6. The patient received a platelet transfusion yesterday but showed a slow drift down in platelet count. No splenomegaly was observed on ultrasound.
7. Antiplt antibody is negative, indicating no evidence of immune-mediated destruction of platelets.
8. Growing GPCs (glycocalicin-positive cells) in the blood suggest ongoing platelet consumption.
9. The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis. RSV was detected on viral culture.
10. The patient is relatively non-compliant with scheduled BIPAP (bi-level positive airway"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, progressive renal failure, and increasing evidence of hemolysis. She meets criteria for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and is undergoing plasmapheresis. There is a suspicion of endocarditis-associated hemolysis, so a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered. The patient has had positive blood cultures, and she is on vancomycin. High-dose steroids are being administered, and platelet transfusion is planned if platelet count falls below 10,000/mm3. The patient's renal function may benefit from intravenous fluids. She also has chronic respiratory failure and requires BiPAP support on a as-needed basis. Other issues include hypothermia in the right foot, which has normal pulses and negative venous and arterial Doppler studies. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with possible progression to multi-organ failure.
2. Endocarditis-associated hemolysis with potential development of septic emboli.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation leading to respiratory failure.
4. Progressive renal failure requiring dial"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She now presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia, marked by a decreasing platelet count and the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral smear. This raises concerns for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), especially given the schistocytes and the fact that other potential causes have been ruled out.

The patient is currently on stress dose steroids, and plasma pheresis was performed today to address the suspected TTP. The goal is to maintain a platelet count above 25,000. Additionally, the patient is being monitored for evidence of bleeding and has received a hematology consult. Active treatment for thrombocytopenia includes continuing stress dose steroids, minimizing medications, and plasma pheresis per heme. 

The patient also has bacteremia caused by enterococcus, for which she is being treated with vancomycin. The local extremity (LE) warmth is a concern for possible cellulitis, but venous and arterial doppler ultrasounds have ruled out thrombosis. 

Furthermore, the patient is experiencing a COPD exacerbation complicated by RSV bronchiolitis. Her chest CT shows no clear infiltrate but does reveal severe emphysema. She is relatively non-compliant with scheduled BiPAP and frequently experiences desaturation"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted for COPD exacerbation, now presenting with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. She also has an episode of respiratory distress during plasmapheresis, which could indicate a possible myocardial infarction, but cardiac enzymes are negative twice. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 144/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on face tent. Physical examination reveals diffuse inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi, heart sounds with regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallops, and bilateral lower extremity edema with left greater than right. Neurological examination shows alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with intact cranial nerves 2-12. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 17.7 to 26.5 K/uL, hemoglobin from 8.6 to 10.3 g/dL, platelet count decreasing from 65 to 24 K/uL, creatinine from 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL, troponin T at 0.06 and 0.05 ng/mL, and glucose levels around 115 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic acid, and LDH, with low albumin, calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels. 

The patient is being treated with furosemide (Lasix), stress dose steroids, plasmapheresis, red blood cell transfusion, and antibiotics for suspected bacteremia. The plan includes continuing plasmapheresis, stress dose steroids, minimizing medications, and consulting hematology. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation and RSV bronchiolitis, possible bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and further thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient's condition needs close monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory distress, bleeding, or evidence of TTP."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD admitted for a COPD exacerbation. The patient now presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The platelet count continues to trend downward despite increased dose steroids. There are growing schistocytes on peripheral smear, suggesting the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Plasma pheresis was performed today to address this concern.

The patient also has bacteremia caused by Enterococcus species, which is being treated with vancomycin. Additionally, there is a concern for potential thrombosis in the lower extremities (LEs), but a Doppler study showed no evidence of venous or arterial thrombus.

The patient has an ongoing COPD exacerbation complicated by RSV bronchiolitis. The chest CT scan revealed severe emphysema but no clear infiltrate. The patient's pulmonary examination has improved, but they are non-compliant with scheduled BiPAP and experience frequent desaturations to the 80s.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and experienced a STEMI related to coronary vasospasm. Lisinopril was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia, and metoprolol is being continued.

Other notable findings include advancing the patient to a regular diet, discontinuing PPN, providing prophylaxis for pneumonia, and maintaining code status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old individual with severe COPD who was initially admitted for a COPD flare and positive RSV infection. They have developed new anemia and thrombocytopenia acutely five days ago and were diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient has been started on plasmapheresis and is currently undergoing treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heme - The patient's low hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count suggest TTP, which is a serious condition requiring urgent treatment. The patient is scheduled for plasmapheresis again today, with a goal Hct of 25 and platelet count of 10.
2. Endo - The patient is on stress dose steroids, which will be continued due to their worsened respiratory status. However, the plan is to taper the steroids tomorrow.
3. Resp - The patient has severe COPD, and their respiratory sounds are worse today compared to previous exams. They will continue to receive nebulizers, steroids as needed, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Pulmonary toilet measures will also be taken.
4. ID - The patient has one blood culture positive for enterococcus, which is likely a line contaminant. They are currently on vancomycin, and sensitivity testing will be done. Vancomycin trough levels will be checked in the morning.

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She now presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient has received three plasmapheresis treatments and possible offending agents have been discontinued. The most concerning differential diagnosis remains thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). She has also received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) this morning. If there is no improvement over the next few days, it may be necessary to discontinue plasmapheresis. The patient's platelet count has increased from the 20s to the 30s without transfusion in the last 24 hours, which may indicate an effect from plasmapheresis. 

The patient has bacteremia caused by Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to vancomycin. She will continue to receive a 14-day course of vancomycin. The patient also has a COPD exacerbation with RSV bronchiolitis. Her chest X-ray shows severe emphysema but no clear infiltrate. She is non-compliant with scheduled BIPAP and experiences frequent desaturations to the 80s. 

For the COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis, the plan includes q2-4 hour standing xopenex and atrovent nebs, Advair, stress dose steroids, BiP"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F with marked COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation, now with
   thrombocytopenia and anemia
   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia:  Platelets continue to trend downward,
   despite increased dose steroids.  Possible offending agents
   discontinued.  Has growing number of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
   Thrombocytopenia from medications and separate hemolysis possible,
   though most concerning of the differential is TTP.  Given this concern,
   plasma pheresis was performed yesterday and will continue today.  S/P
   another unit of pRBCs this AM.  Labs overall unchanged after first
   pheresis.  If continued no change over next couple days, may have to
   abandon plasmapheresis.
   -          cont stress dose steroids
   -          minimize medications
   -          plasma pheresis per heme
   -          plt goal > 10,000 or bleeding
   -          Continue to follow for evidence of bleeding
   -          Hematology Consult following
   -          Active T/S, goal HCT > 25
   # Bacteremia:  enterococcus growing in one BCx.  Possibly contaminant,
   though should continue treatment given critical illness.
   - cont vanc, f/u sensitivities
   # COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis  - +RSV on viral culture.. CT
   Chest with no clear infilitrate, c/w severe emphysema. Is relatively
   non compliant with scheduled BIPAP and has frequent desats to 80s.
   Pulm exam worsened today.
   -  q2-4 hour standing xopenex and atrovent nebs
   - Advair
   - Receiving stress dose steroids as above, with plan to taper back down
   to home dose of Prednisone 20mg daily eventually as tolerated.
   - BiPAP PRN
   - pulmonary toilet with OOB
   - diurese prn
   # Coronary Artery Disease s/p STEMI related to coronary vasospasm:
   Episode of SOB during pheresis could indicate MI, but CEs negative x 2.
   -            One more set of CEs
   -            ASA discontinued in the setting of thrombocytopenia
   -            continue metoprolol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical conditions. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/50 mmHg to 154/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. 

The patient has received plasmapheresis and two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Her labs indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count ranging from 22,000 to 31,000/uL, anemia with hemoglobin levels between 8.0 g/dL and 26.7%, and elevated white blood cell count ranging from 18,500 to 26.5 K/uL. Other lab results include elevated creatinine levels, increased troponin-T, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient has several potential medical complications. 

1. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient's platelet count continues to trend downward despite increased dose steroids. The presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear raises concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with marked COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She now presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient has received three plasmapheresis sessions and possible offending agents have been discontinued. The most concerning differential remains thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient has also received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) this morning. If there is no change over the next couple of days, plasmapheresis may be abandoned. However, the increase in platelets from the 20s to 30s last 24 hours without transfusion may indicate an effect from plasmapheresis.

The patient is being weaned off steroids and minimizing medications. Plasma pheresis will be continued per heme/path. Platelet transfusion will only be given if there is active bleeding, otherwise, it will be avoided in patients with TTP. The patient will continue to be monitored for evidence of bleeding, and a hematology consult has been scheduled. The goal hematocrit (HCT) is greater than 25.

The patient has bacteremia caused by Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to vancomycin. A 14-day course of vancomycin will be continued. The patient also has a COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis, with positive RSV on viral culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She now presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Plasmapheresis was performed on day #4, which showed marginal improvement in platelet count. Alternate explanations for thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, and potential offending agents have been discontinued.

The patient has a trend of decreasing hematocrit from 41 to 22 since admission. Haptoglobin levels are low and elevated LDH is suggestive of hemolysis. Rare schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear, as per Hematology consult. Coombs antibody negative. Abdominal wall hematoma is also a potential source for blood loss.

Bacteremia with Vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis has been identified. No clear source has been found. Surveillance blood cultures are being followed, and a 14-day course of vancomycin is being continued. The dose of vancomycin has been reduced due to supratherapeutic trough levels.

The patient continues to require intermittent bipap for respiratory support due to COPD exacerbation/RSV bronchiolitis. Medications include scheduled pm bipap, intermittent BiPAP PRN, pulmonary toilet, and a steroid taper to prednisone 40 mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. She also has thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and is on plasmapheresis day 4. The patient is being treated for enterococcus fecalis in her blood cultures with vancomycin, with plans for a 14-day course. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 130/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has diminished breath sounds in her chest and 4+ peripheral edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 0.06 ng/mL. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, acute thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, anxiety, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation, RSV infection, and TTP. She is currently in the ICU and has been undergoing plasmapheresis. 

The patient has tolerated plasmapheresis but her platelet count is still not improving, and there are signs of hemolysis on the smear. She received one unit of PRBC for anemia. The HIT ab test was negative twice, and she is being continued on Vanc for enterococcus bacteremia.

The patient's respiratory failure is acute/chronic, thrombocytopenia is acute/TTP, and she has tachycardia with other causes. She also has anxiety.

The plan includes continuing with Vanc for enterococcus fecalis in blood cultures, weaning steroids, using nightly bipap, and starting Spiriva upon discharge. The TTP will be followed up with peripheral smear and Adamts13 levels. No improvement in platelet count has been observed, so the heme should be checked, along with the retic count and bilis.

Hypernatremia is improving, and prophylaxis for DVT is not necessary due to normal coagulation and severe ecchymosis from thrombocytopenia. The patient is unable to wear boots, so teds and OOB should be tried. 

Regarding CAD, ASA is held, and the patient is on a"
