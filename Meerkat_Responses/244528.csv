","The patient is a 34-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He has been in multiple ICU transfers and is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. He also has hypotension, hypernatremia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 mmHg to 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 40%. The patient's lung examination reveals bilateral rhonchi throughout anterior lung fields. The abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen with soft and positive fluid wave. The neurological examination indicates sedation.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count ranging from 13.3 to 19.4 K/uL, hemoglobin from 23.1 to 26.2 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 89 to 176 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 102 and 148 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. He has been in the ICU multiple times and has had previous complications including an esophageal variceal bleed. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypernatremia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. He is being treated with antibiotics for suspected ESBL enterobacter infection, and his lactate levels are being monitored. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he requires free water flushes and dextrose in water. He also has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylactic heparin and stress ulcer medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and previous history of aspiration, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and elevated ammonia levels put him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and even coma.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): With the patient's history of diabetes and poor glycemic control, there is a risk of DKA, characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis.

   banding for variceal bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy
   on [**2172-5-10**], multiple ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU
   s/p respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: Given acute event, CXR with worsening RML/RLL
   infiltrates, and vomitus suctioned from patient's airway, respiratory
   failure was likely due to an aspiration event.  This occured once
   previously during his hospitalization, where he was also intubated
   after Code Blue was called.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was previously intubated due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has undergone esophageal banding for variceal bleeding. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypernatremia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. He is being treated with antibiotics, sedation, daily respiratory system assessments, and various interventions related to his underlying conditions. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending resolution of his current issues in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous aspiration event and worsening RML/RLL infiltrates on CXR indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure if proper ventilation and clearance of secretions are not maintained.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk for hepatic encephalopathy to recur. Monitoring of mental status and neurologic function, along with appropriate management of lactate levels and other contributing factors, is crucial.

3. Esophageal Varices: Although the patient has already undergone banding, there is still a risk for rebleeding or development of new varices. Regular monitoring and appropriate intervention if any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding occur are essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 34-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He was transferred to the ICU intubated after experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's current condition shows that he is stable at his current ventilator settings and did not tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial. His chest X-ray worsened today, so he will be left alone to recover for now. Sputum culture and sensitivity tests are being followed, and he is on meropenem and vancomycin due to an ESBL enterobacter infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. It is important to closely monitor his respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is within the desired range of 55-60. However, if hypotension recurs, consideration should be given to using vasopressor therapy such as [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Varices: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and a history of variceal bleed. He is currently being managed with lactulose and rifaximin.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He underwent esophageal banding for variceal bleeding and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if there is no improvement in his condition. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics for an ESBL-producing enterobacter in his sputum. There is a risk of developing further infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating potential hypotension. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid replacement are required to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Varices: The patient's underlying alcoholic cirrhosis and history of variceal bleeding pose ongoing risks. Management with lactulose and rifaximin is recommended to prevent hepatic encephalopathy and further complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be corrected with free water administration.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring and appropriate management are"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been admitted multiple times and is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has thick sputum and is unable to clear it effectively. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be attributed to his chronic liver disease and the use of vasopressors. There is a concern for adrenal insufficiency, and stress dose steroids may be required if blood pressures remain low.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. He has undergone banding for the varices. Management includes increasing lactulose to promote stool output and continuing rifaximin.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and there is a need for free water flushes through the oral gastric (OG) tube and administration of D5W to correct the hypernatremia.

5. Anemia: The patient has a slightly lower baseline hemoglobin level. He has received one unit of packed red blood cells"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications related to his condition, including variceal bleeding, aspiration, encephalopathy, and respiratory arrest. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by increased infiltrates on the chest X-ray and increased secretions. He also has hypernatremia and residual volume.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 86/42 mmHg (81/33 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The physical examination reveals that the patient has an enlarged left pupil, normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses present, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and distended extremities. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has multiple complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal pain, hypernatremia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated lung injury.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of further hypotension leading to organ perfusion issues. The patient may require ongoing fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which could be due to distention. There is a risk of developing complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome or worsening of liver function.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which need to be corrected to prevent neurological complications. Free water administration should be closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are slightly lower than baseline, indicating the need for ongoing monitoring and possible transfusion support.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and tight glycemic control should"

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin at this time.
   -Sputum culture
pending, no organisms on Sputum and no growth to date
   -Completed 5 additional days of antibiotics after 16 day course last
   ICU stay
stop antibiotics
   -Fent/versed for sedation
bolus only, no infusion
   -follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   -Goal I/O even to negative, check CVP and central venous sat
   -Change to PSV 15/8
   #Hypotension:  can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver disease.  Am
   cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -restarted pressors overnight for persistent hypotension, on low dose
   norepi
   -once off pressors, will diurese
   # Abdominal pain: improved post paracentesis
likely related to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and multiple ICU transfers. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's sputum is thick and bilious, and a sputum culture is pending. Antibiotics have been completed for an additional five days after a previous 16-day course during the last ICU stay. The patient's sedation will be managed with fentanyl andversed, with bolus administration only and no infusion. The goal is to achieve even intake and output, check central venous pressure (CVP), and central venous saturation. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he can tolerate a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 as chronic liver disease. The patient had previously received steroids. Pressors were restarted overnight for persistent hypotension, and low-dose norepinephrine is being used. Once the patient is off pressors, diuresis will be initiated. The patient's abdominal pain has improved post-paracentesis, likely related to distention. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices, which were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. Lactulose has been increased to 60 ml every six hours, with robust stool output, and rifaximin will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been through multiple ICU transfers and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious. Sputum culture is pending, and no organisms have been identified to date. The patient is receiving an 8-day course of meropenem and vancomycin.

2. Hypotension: The patient can tolerate a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 due to chronic liver disease. His am cortisol level is 6.5, and he had previously received steroids. Stress dose steroids may be required, and consideration should be given to restarting pressors for persistent hypotension.

3. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved post paracentesis, likely related to distention.

4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices, for which he underwent banding during this prolonged hospitalization. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned today with hepatology for interval variceal evaluation.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerates free water flushes with improved residuals. He should continue with the prescribed treatment.

6. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin level is 25-27, and he is slightly lower than baseline. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with a goal hematocrit (HCT) of 25. Vitamin B12 supplementation should be continued.

7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient should be managed with standing NPH insulin and HISS. Dextrose should be administered as needed for fasting blood sugar (FS) levels below 70.

8. Alcohol Abuse: The patient should receive folic acid and multivitamins (MVI) as part of his treatment.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia), and code status. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  CXR worse this morning, but got IVF yesterday.
   Likely CXR worsening and HOTN is due to fluid shifts and hemodynamic
   problems associated with removal of ascitic fluid coupled with
   repletion of saline for HOTN which likely accumulated in the lungs.
   Will try duresis today.
   HOTN:  most likely due to fluid shifts.  Will check CVL saturation.
   Also check CVP
   Aspiration PNA:  all cultures negative, more likely a pneumonitis.  WBC
   coming down.  Will stop vanco and meropenem
   Anemia:  Hct stable
   DM:  on SSI

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin
   -Sputum culture
new gram stain without organsims
   -Completed 5 additional days of antibiotics after 16 day course last
   ICU stay
stop antibiotics
   -Fent/versed for sedation
bolus only, no infusion
   -follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   -Goal I/O even to negative, CVP elevated.  Given lasix bolus with plan
   for lasix gtt today for fluid removal as this worked previously.
   -Did not tolerate PSV yesterday.
   #Hypotension:  can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver disease.  Am
   cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -Started stress steroids.
   -BP stable, plan for diuresis today.
   -Continue albumin
    # Abdominal pain: improved post paracentesis
likely related to
   distention
    # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade
   II esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   - lactulose/rifaximin with good stool output
   - pending EGD with hepatology.
    # Hypernatremia:  completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerating
   his free water flushes as residuals much improved.
   - continuing to follow [**Hospital1 **] Na
    # Anemia: currently at baseline, no transfusion
   # Thrombocytopenia: lower platelet count off vancomycin, though may
   continue to have some medication in his system. D/c heparin
   # Diabetes Mellitus: standing NPH with HISS,  dextrose prn FS<70
   # Alcohol abuse:  folate/MVI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He has been admitted multiple times to the ICU and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, thick sputum, and moderate bilious amount. He remains intubated and continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

The patient also has hypotension, which is well-tolerated with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 due to chronic liver disease. His cortisol levels are low, and he has been started on stress steroids. The plan is for diuresis today and to continue albumin administration.

The patient's abdominal pain has improved post-paracentesis, likely related to distention. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. Lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with hepatology is pending.

The patient has hypernatremia, which was corrected by completing 2 L of D5W yesterday. He is now tolerating free water flushes as residuals have improved. Continuing to follow [**Hospital1 **] Na.

The patient also has anemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypotension, abdominal pain, anemia, hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and experiencing worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The thick sputum is also a concern, which could lead to further complications such as pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple cultures taken, including urine and sputum, with pending results. This suggests a concern for infection, and the recent antibiotic course indicates an active infection management strategy.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy may continue to be a concern, especially with the ongoing use of lactulose and rifaximin. Close monitoring of mental status and neurologic function is necessary.
4. Variceal Bleeding: The patient has grade II esophageal varices and is scheduled for an endoscopy today. There is a risk of variceal bleeding, which could be life-threatening and require urgent intervention.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to chronic liver disease and may"

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin at this time.
   -Sputum culture
pending, no organisms on Sputum and no growth to date
   -Completed 5 additional days of antibiotics after 16 day course last
   ICU stay
stop antibiotics

bolus only, no infusion
   -follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   -Goal I/O even to negative, check CVP and central venous sat
   -Change to PSV 15/8
   #Hypotension:  can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver disease.  Am
   cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -restarted pressors overnight for persistent hypotension, on low dose
   norepi
   -once off pressors, will diurese
    # Abdominal pain: improved post paracentesis
likely related to
   distention
    # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade
   II esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   - increse lactulose 60 ml q6 hours with robust stool output
   - continue rifaximin
   - plan for EGD today with hepatology for interval variceal
   evaluation
ask to hold off until pressures better
    # Hypernatremia:  completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerating
   his free water flushes as residuals much improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was previously intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient remains intubated with worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has thick, bilious sputum and is being given sedation with fentanyl andversed. The plan is to follow with an am chest X-ray, SBT, RSBI, and administer lasix with albumin to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is being planned for diuresis. He also has hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. His alcohol abuse is being managed with folate and MVI. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through Fibersource HN at 60 mL/hour. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening despite being intubated, indicating a potential risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for several days, suggesting a potential infection that needs to be closely monitored.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy indicates a risk of recurrence or worsening of this condition.
4. Variceal Bleeding: The patient has grade II esophageal varices and a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which puts him at risk for variceal bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be carefully managed to prevent complications such as dehydration or neurological disturbances.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs to be monitored closely to prevent complications related to blood sugar control.
8. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms, which need to be managed appropriately.
9. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged bedridden state increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has experienced recurrent aspiration pneumonia and hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Fever with unknown origin: The patient has a fever of 101.2°F, but the source of the fever is unclear. This may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting a possible infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating dehydration or imbalances in fluid and electrolyte levels.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has shown altered mental status, which could be related to hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the abdomen, which is commonly seen in cirrhosis.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, indicating possible diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin condition suggests potential pressure ulcers or other skin issues due to prolonged bed rest.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is worsening pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. This indicates a need for immediate intervention to support breathing.
9. Ileus: The patient has an intestinal paralysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy, multiple ICU transfers, and is now intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has a history of multiple complications including hypotension, alcoholic cirrhosis with grade II esophageal varices, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has been receiving various treatments such as antibiotics, diuretics, steroids, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Continued intubation is recommended to support the patient's breathing. Monitoring of sputum cultures, CXR, SBT (Saturation by CO2), and RSBI (Rapid shallow breathing index) will help assess the progress.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with the use of low-dose steroids. However, the patient's chronic liver disease may make him more prone to hypotension. Diuresis is planned today, and the patient will continue to receive albumin infusions.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis has been complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. Lactulose and rifaximin are being used to manage"

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin
   -Sputum culture
new gram stain without organsims
   -Completed 5 additional days of antibiotics after 16 day course last
   ICU stay
no abx for now
   -Fent/versed for sedation
bolus only, no infusion
   -follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   -Lasix gtt after bolus lasix dose with standing albumin with goal neg
   1-2L
   -Did not tolerate PSV yesterday-no plan for extubation today--?
   Trach/PEG
   #Hypotension:  can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver disease.  Am
   cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -Started stress steroids, will plan 5 day course, taper to 25 mg tid
   today.
   -BP stable, plan for diuresis today.
   -Continue albumin
    # Abdominal pain: improved post paracentesis
likely related to
   distention
    # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade
   II esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   - lactulose/rifaximin with good stool output
   - pending EGD with hepatology.
    # Hypernatremia:  completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerating
   his free water flushes as residuals much improved.
   - continuing to follow [**Hospital1 **] Na
   -continue flushes, plan for diuresis
    # Anemia: currently at baseline, no transfusion
   # Thrombocytopenia: lower platelet count off vancomycin, though may
   continue to have some medication in his system. D/c heparin and use
   pneumoboots
   # Diabetes Mellitus: standing NPH with HISS,  dextrose prn FS<70

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and has been in the ICU multiple times. He was recently transferred intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and continues to have thick, bilious sputum. He remains intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal pain, alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy and esophageal varices, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is at risk for these complications due to his underlying conditions and current ICU stay.

Please note that the patient's condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent and address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  looks great for extubation.   However given
   mental status and risk of reaspiration, his risk reintubation is very
   high.
   Given this tracheostomy is probably best course for preventing this
   from happening.  CXR improved with diuresis
   Cirrhosis:  not NGT given recent banding, so off lactulose
   hypernatremia:  due to lasix, getting free water

   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin. s/p 16 + 6 days of Abx.
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - lasix gtt for -1.5 to -2 L, possible d/c later this afternoon
   - follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   -Lasix gtt after bolus lasix dose with standing albumin with goal neg
   1-2L, may d/c later today
   -talk to family regarding trach peg
   #Hypotension: Resovled. Can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver
   disease.  Am cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -reduced steroids to 12.5 mg
   -BP stable, plan for diuresis today.
   -Continue albumin
    # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade
   II esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   - lactulose/rifaximin with good stool output
   - pending EGD with hepatology
 consider post pyloric tube placement
    # Hypernatremia:  completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerating
   his free water flushes as residuals much improved.
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -continue flushes
   - on D5W currently
    # Anemia: currently at baseline, no transfusion
   # Thrombocytopenia: lower platelet count off vancomycin, though may
   continue to have some medication in his system. D/c heparin and use

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. He presented with hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. The patient has been intubated and remains in the ICU with worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely reflective of fluid/albumin and has thick sputum, which may lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient previously had hypotension but has resolved. However, the patient has chronic liver disease and requires careful management of blood pressure. Reduction of steroids from 20 mg to 12.5 mg IV every 8 hours has been done.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with complications of hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. Lactulose and rifaximin have been initiated to manage hepatic encephalopathy, and an EGD with hepatology is pending.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has been addressed by completing 2 L of D5W yesterday. The patient is now tolerating free water flushes with improved residuals. Ongoing monitoring of electrolytes is required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, ascites, hyperglycemia, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, ileus, respiratory failure, cirrhosis of the liver, hypotension, and potential need for a tracheostomy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 87/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving hydrocortisone, lasix, PPI, antibiotics, and various other medications. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,521 mL and output of 4,905 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,384 mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of sodium, potassium, and glucose, as well as abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 13.3 and 6.1 K/uL, Hct between 26.2 and 23.9%, Plt between 89 and 48 K/uL, and Cr between 0.7 and 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set Vt of 0 mL and Spontaneous Vt of 495 mL. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.28. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and the skin, neurologic examination, and physical examination are also not assessed. The patient's disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. Given the patient's altered mental status and impaired skin integrity, there is a higher risk of developing pressure ulcers, pneumonia, or other infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels put him at risk for complications related to diabetes, such as infections, poor wound healing, and cardiovascular events.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not appropriately managed, leading to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory arrest.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's history of cirrhosis and abnormal liver enzymes indicate possible liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications like hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's negative fluid balance suggests ongoing fluid losses, which may require careful management to prevent hypotension and renal dysfunction.
7. Ileus: The patient's ileus could lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or infection.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He has been in the ICU multiple times and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. He has worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and continues to have thick, bilious sputum. The patient's respiratory status is reflective of fluid and albumin administration. He has been on antibiotics for 16 days.

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he previously experienced an episode of hypotension. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this hospitalization. His sodium levels are improved but still elevated at 145.

The patient has anemia at baseline and is not currently receiving a blood transfusion. He also has thrombocytopenia with a lower platelet count, possibly due to vancomycin use. Heparin has been discontinued, and the patient is using pneumatic boots to prevent deep vein thrombosis. His diabetes mellitus is managed with NPH and HISS, and he is given dextrose as needed when his fasting blood sugar is below 70.

The patient's alcohol abuse is being addressed with folate and multivitamin supplementation. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition via parenteral route, and stress ulcer"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is decreased hydrocortisone, hypernatremia, stopped lasix gtt, changed PPI to IV, attempted dobbhoff but unsuccessful, trach planned for Friday but likely Monday with thoracics in OR, noted to be bradycardic 40-50 while sleeping, bolused 500 x 1 for low SBP, allergies to Haldol and Ativan, and confusion/delirium.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/50 to 131/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a temperature of 35.6 C (96 F). The patient's weight is 103 kg, and height is 69 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,521 mL and total output of 4,905 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,384 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, anxious expression, anisocoria, normocephalic head, endotracheal and NG tubes, symmetric chest expansion, bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, distended abdomen, 2+ edema in both extremities, and no assessment of skin, neurologic status, or peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), along with high blood glucose levels. The liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), total bilirubin (T Bili), amylase, lipase, fibrinogen, lactic acid, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels are within normal range or slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes fever of unknown origin (FUO), leukocytosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, ascites, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, ileus, respiratory failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection), gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and worsening renal function.

The patient's care plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   # Respiratory Failure: aspiration with [**Doctor Last Name **] and most recent CXR with
   worsening bilateral infiltrates.  Remain intubated.  Continues to have
   thick sputum, moderate amount, bilious.  Resp status most likely
   reflective of fluid/albumin. s/p 16 + 6 days of Abx.
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - hold lasix gtt
   - follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI
   - add on for OR today for trach by thoracic surgery; will need plt>80
   and INR<1.5
   #Hypotension: Resovled. Can tolerate MAP of 55 as chronic liver
   disease.  Am cortisol 6.5. Had previously received steroids
   -reduced steroids to 12.5 mg
   -BP stable, plan for diuresis today.
   -Continue albumin
    # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade
   II esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   - lactulose/rifaximin with good stool output
   - pending EGD with hepatology
 consider post pyloric tube placement
    # Hypernatremia:  completed 2 L of D5W yesterday and now tolerating
   his free water flushes as residuals much improved.
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -continue flushes
   - on D5W currently
    # Anemia: currently at baseline, no transfusion
   # Thrombocytopenia: lower platelet count off vancomycin, though may
   continue to have some medication in his system. D/c heparin and use
   pneumoboots
   # Diabetes Mellitus: standing NPH with HISS,  dextrose prn FS<70

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He was previously admitted to the ICU and intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. He has been receiving antibiotics for 16 days and has had multiple ICU transfers.

The patient currently has several medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated with worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has thick sputum, which is bilious in nature. His respiratory status is reflective of fluid and albumin administration. Tracheostomy is planned for today, pending platelet count above 80,000/mL and INR below 1.5.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has resolved with the use of steroids. The dose of steroids has been reduced to 12.5 mg. The patient is stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55, which is acceptable for chronic liver disease. Diuretics will be initiated today.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. Lactulose and rifaximin are being used to manage hepatic encephalopathy. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with hepatology consultation is pending. Postpyloric tube placement is also being considered.
4. Hypernatremia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He has been in multiple ICU transfers and is now intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient continues to have thick sputum and worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. His respiratory status is reflective of fluid and albumin administration. He has received 16 + 6 days of antibiotics.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he can tolerate a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 due to chronic liver disease. His am cortisol level is 6.5, and he had previously received steroids. One episode of hypotension was likely related to diuresis. Steroids and albumin should be discontinued.

The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices, which were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. Rifaximin and lactulose should be given, and an IR consultation is required for Dobhoff placement today.

The patient's hypernatremia has improved to 145, and free water flushes should be resumed once the Dobhoff tube is placed. Sodium levels should be trended.

The patient has anemia at baseline, and no transfusion is planned. Thrombocytopenia is present, and platelet"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been in the ICU multiple times and is now intubated due to respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. He has a history of multiple complications including hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and grade II esophageal varices. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is reflective of fluid/albumin and he has thick sputum, indicating a high risk of continued respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, there is a risk of recurrent episodes due to his chronic liver disease and diuretic use.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. This puts him at risk for further complications such as variceal bleeding or hepatic coma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. He has an anisocoric pupil and his abdomen is distended. His lab results show a WBC count of 11.6 K/uL, Hct of 26.6%, Plt of 65 K/uL, Cr of 1.0 mg/dL, and Glucose of 186 mg/dL. Other labs are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which is helping to stabilize his respiratory status. The goal is to wean him off the ventilator soon.
2. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension but is now off albumin and steroids. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55 mmHg.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis has led to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and grade II es"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted with hepatic encephalopathy. He presented with respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration, and required intubation. The patient has been on antibiotics for 16 days and has had multiple ICU transfers. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. His condition may worsen if there is further aspiration or development of pneumonia.
2. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. There is a risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and potential variceal bleeding.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which could be related to antibiotic use or other underlying conditions. This may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a high level of sodium in the blood. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent complications.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can be related to chronic disease or blood loss. This may contribute to fatigue and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, a low plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and multiple ICU transfers. He was intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has a history of hypotension, which has resolved, and he is currently on supportive care. He also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. He continues to have thick, bilious sputum, and his current respiratory status is reflective of fluid and albumin administration. The plan is to follow up with sputum cultures, hold lasix gtt and aim for a urine output of +500 mL, follow am CXR/SBT/RSBI, and proceed with tracheostomy on Monday after achieving platelet count >80 and INR<1.5.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he may experience further episodes, especially during diuresis. The plan is to discontinue steroids and albumin.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. He will be started on rifaximin and lactulose once Dobhoff placement is done.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved, but he should resume free water flushes once Dobhoff placement is done.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is currently at baseline, and no transfusion is planned.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is lower due to vancomycin, and he may continue to have some medication in his system. Heparin and pneumoboots will be discontinued, and platelet trends will be monitored.

7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is on standing NPH with HISS and dextrose prn for fasting blood sugar <70.

8. Alcohol Abuse: The patient will receive folate and MVI.

Overall, the patient's main concerns are respiratory failure, hypotension, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on 05/10/2172. The patient has had multiple ICU transfers and is now intubated in the ICU following respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has been on antibiotics for 16 days and has been on pressure support of 5 cmH2O but was placed on assisted control ventilation overnight due to sedation.

24-hour events include the placement and removal of a Dopoff, the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TFs), transition from lasix gtt to intravenous push, discontinuation of hydrocortisone and albumin, and the resumption of acetaminophen overnight.

Allergies include oral haloperidol and lorazepam. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 06/19/2172 at 04:55 PM.

Current infusions include pantoprazole, furosemide, and midazolam. Other medications include fibersource HN (full) at 70 mL/hour, NPH with HISS for diabetes mellitus, and folate/MVI for alcohol abuse.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except as noted above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has undergone multiple interventions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/55 to 154/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination is incomplete due to sedation and inability to assess movement, tone, or tremor. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's medical conditions include alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. 

The plan of care includes weaning off sedation, evaluating for tracheostomy, managing diarrhea, addressing hypernatremia, monitoring for complications of cirrhosis, controlling blood glucose levels, and providing prophylaxis for"

He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to an upper respiratory tract infection with pneumonia. Upon admission, he was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic with decreased breath sounds on the left side. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, and his urine output is 2,990 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, sodium of 155 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, blood glucose of 212 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 90 K/uL. His blood cultures are negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been in the ICU multiple times, most recently intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is dependent on ventilator settings. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of further hypotension, which may lead to organ perfusion issues.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis with Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can progress and lead to increased mental status changes or even coma.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in his blood, which can cause neurological symptoms and dehydration.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are below normal, indicating anemia. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to the ICU. He is currently intubated due to respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, Lasix, insulin, and others. His vital signs are stable, but he has a high blood glucose level. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 62 mL. His laboratory results indicate abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and others. The patient's chest X-ray shows increased bilateral patchy infiltrates. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to aspiration, alcoholic cirrhosis with complications, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. The patient is also being managed for diarrhea, tracheostomy placement on Monday, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient's increased bilat patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest possible pneumonia. Additionally, his elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of"

   Respiratory Failure: Stable, off antibiotics, related to aspiration
   event and subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **]
vent settings mostly dependent on mental
   status at this time.
   - given hypotensive episodes overnight, holding lasix gtt for now
   - will defer OR today for trach given transient hypotension although
   suspect this was secondary to overly aggressive diuresis.  Will plan
   for OR again tomorrow with plans for plt>80 and INR<1.5; Vit K 5 mg po

thoracics following
   - PSV during day, can change to AC as necessary
   - will try to transition to bolus sedation today from continuous
   Hypotension: Several episodes of hypotension to 80s overnight, may be
   secondary to overly aggressive diuresis although must keep infection in
   the differential given rising WBC.  BP now stable since discontinuation
   of the lasix gtt.  Will use cautious IV fluid boluses if necessary to

   - recheck C. diff, BCx, UCx, Sputum Cx
   - consider further infectious w/u with imaging if spikes fever or

   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -plan for repeat dobhoff placement with trach
   Hypernatremia: Continues to be an active issue, difficult to control,
   requiring intermittent IV D5W and frequent water flushes.  Current
   serum sodium is 146.
   - will restart free water via NGT
   - will check PM sodium and consider restarting D5W
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion
   Thrombocytopenia: Improving off abx and sc heparin.  Likely
   multifactorial also related to liver disease.
   - will cautiously restart SC heparin

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's rising WBC count suggests the possibility of an infection. Further investigation should be done to rule out any infectious causes.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy needs to be closely monitored, as it can recur. Proper management with lactulose and rifaximin should be continued.
3. Variceal bleeding: As the patient has grade II esophageal varices, there is a risk of variceal bleeding. Monitoring the patient's condition and considering banding or other interventions if necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's ongoing issue with hypernatremia requires careful management. Frequent water flushes and appropriate IV fluids should be administered to maintain normal serum sodium levels.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count needs to be closely monitored, especially considering his history of liver disease. Appropriate measures should be taken to improve the platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and has been admitted multiple times to the ICU. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, hypotension, alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. The patient's treatment plan includes orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, goal I/O 500 cc negative, planned tracheostomy on Monday, sedation as necessary, VBG today, PSV during the day, and AC as needed. The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration. This can lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis. It can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and shock.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent several interventions including fresh frozen plasma transfusion to correct coagulopathy, diagnostic tap for leukocytosis, addition of spironolactone via oral gastric tube, increased norepinephrine infusion, tightening of sedation-syncope index, holding of tranexamic acid after morning nutrition, administration of Lasix to manage sodium levels, and fluid boluses for stable blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/48 mmHg to 82/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 146 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 257 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's platelet count has also been increasing over the past few days.

The patient's physical examination reveals the absence of peripheral vascular pulses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and multiple ICU transfers. He is currently intubated in the ICU following respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event. The patient has a history of hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus. He is being treated for alcoholic cirrhosis with rifaximin and lactulose through an OG tube, as well as IV PPI. The patient's hypernatremia remains an active issue, requiring IV D5W and frequent water flushes. His thrombocytopenia is improving off antibiotics and subcutaneous heparin. The patient's current condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypernatremia. Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. He has been intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, alcoholic cirrhosis with complications, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced several episodes of hypotension, which may be due to diuresis or sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending upwards, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and conducting appropriate infectious workup is crucial.

4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and esophageal varices. Management of these conditions includes lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and banding for varices.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient continues to have difficulty controlling his sodium levels,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with various medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorders, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, ascites, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, ileus, acute respiratory failure, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, and potential problems with nutrition and glycemic control. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and other electrolytes, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and kidney dysfunction.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation, potentially leading to sepsis or organ damage if not properly managed.
3. Hypernatremia: The high sodium level can cause dehydration, confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected promptly.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as liver dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, or infections. It requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration or worsening confusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was admitted to the ICU. He underwent esophageal banding for variceal bleeding and has since developed respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He experienced several episodes of hypotension overnight, which were likely caused by overly aggressive diuresis. The patient's leukocyte count is trending up, and he has yeast in his urine and sputum. His sodium levels are still elevated at 146, and he requires ongoing management of hypernatremia. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to aspiration and subsequent ventilator settings. He is currently stable but will need ongoing monitoring and adjustment of ventilator support as necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced several episodes of hypotension overnight, which could be due to overly aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring and cautious IV fluid boluses may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocyte count is trending up, indicating a possible infection. Further infectious workup is needed, including rechecking C. diff, blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures.

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   Respiratory Failure: Off antibiotics, related to aspiration event and
   subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **]. Self-extubated last night but appears stable on NC.
   - Plan for trach to prevent complications of expected future aspiration
   events. For OR, needs plt>80 and INR<1.5; Vit K 5 mg po x 3 days.
   Thoracics following
   - PSV during day, can change to AC as necessary
   - intermittent boluses prn for sedation
   Hypotension: BP now stable since discontinuation of the lasix gtt.
   Stably elevated WBC with less concern for sepsis given absence of fever
   or left shift on diff today, negative cultures, and no evidence of SBP
   on paracentesis.
   - Cautious IV fluid boluses if necessary for MAPs < 55
   Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile with stably elevated WBC and no left shift
   today. [**6-20**] C. diff neg. All micro neg to date other than yeast in
   urine and sputum. Peritoneal fluid not c/w SBP. Hasn
t received
   steroids since [**6-17**] so unlikely this relates to current leukocytosis.
   - cont to trend wbc.
   - consider further infectious w/u if spikes fever or clinically
   decompensates
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.

   -plan for repeat dobhoff placement with trach
   Hypernatremia: Improving with free water flushes.  Current serum sodium
   is 145.
   - cont  free water via NGT
   - will check PM sodium
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion.
   Thrombocytopenia: Improving off abx and sc heparin.  Likely
   multifactorial also related to liver disease.
   - will cautiously restart SC heparin
   Diabetes Mellitus: Standing NPH with HISS, dextrose prn FS<70

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**] and has been in multiple ICU transfers.
- The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event.
- The patient self-extubated last night but appears stable on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is planned for a tracheostomy to prevent complications of future aspiration events.
- The patient's respiratory status will be monitored with pressure support ventilation during the day and can be changed to assist-control as necessary.
- Intermittent boluses of sedation will be given as needed.
- The patient's hypotension is stable since the discontinuation of lasix drip.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.0 K/uL, but is afebrile and there is no left shift on differential today. Cultures have been negative to date, and there is no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis on paracentesis.
- The patient's hypernatremia is improving with free water flushes.
- The patient has anemia at baseline and will not receive a transfusion at this time.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving off antibiotics and subcutaneous heparin. SC heparin will be cautiously restarted.

   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], multiple
   ICU transfers, now transferred intubated to ICU s/p respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   Respiratory Failure: Off antibiotics, related to aspiration event and
   subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **]. Self-extubated last night but appears stable on NC.
   - Plan for trach to prevent complications of expected future aspiration
   events. For OR, needs plt>80 and INR<1.5; Vit K 5 mg po x 3 days.
   Thoracics following
   - PSV during day, can change to AC as necessary
   - intermittent boluses prn for sedation
   Hypotension: BP now stable since discontinuation of the lasix gtt.
   Stably elevated WBC with less concern for sepsis given absence of fever
   or left shift on diff today, negative cultures, and no evidence of SBP
   on paracentesis.
   - Cautious IV fluid boluses if necessary for MAPs < 55
   Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile with stably elevated WBC and no left shift
   today. [**6-20**] C. diff neg. All micro neg to date other than yeast in
   urine and sputum. Peritoneal fluid not c/w SBP. Hasn
t received
   steroids since [**6-17**] so unlikely this relates to current leukocytosis.
   - cont to trend wbc.
   - consider further infectious w/u if spikes fever or clinically
   decompensates
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   -rifaximin and lactulose per OG tube
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -plan for repeat dobhoff placement with trach
   Hypernatremia: Improving with free water flushes.  Current serum sodium
   is 145.
   - cont  free water via NGT
   - will check PM sodium
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion.
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely multifactorial related to liver disease and
   abx.
   - SC heparin restarted with continued improvement in thrombocytopenia

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event. The patient underwent esophageal banding for variceal bleed and has had multiple ICU transfers. He is currently intubated and on nasal cannula oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to an aspiration event. There is a plan for tracheostomy to prevent future aspiration events.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable since discontinuing the lasix drip. Caution should be taken with IV fluid boluses if necessary for mean arterial pressures (MAPs) below 55.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a stably elevated white blood cell count without signs of infection. Further infectious workup may be considered if the patient spikes a fever or clinically decompensates.
4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices. Treatment includes rifaximin and lactulose through the OG tube.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is improving with free water flushes. Continued free water administration via NGT is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was scheduled for a tracheostomy but the procedure was delayed due to hypotension. The patient also experienced significant diuresis over the 24-hour period, so the lasix drip was discontinued. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed without evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient was started on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Additionally, the patient self-extubated and was placed on nasal cannula oxygen, which he tolerated overnight.

24-hour events include sputum culture, urine culture, blood cultured, paracentesis, invasive ventilation stopped, unplanned extubation (patient-initiated), and CXR portable.

Medical History:
The patient has a history of encephalopathy and allergies to Haldol (Oral) and Ativan (Oral). The last dose of antibiotics was given, and the patient is currently receiving various medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues, including no cough, tachypnea, or wheeze. The patient is NPO and has a Foley catheter in place. There are no skin rashes or evidence of jaundice.

Vital Signs:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 mmHg to 156/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is 101.7 kg, and their height is 69 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's flowsheet data shows a fluid balance of 3,164 mL in total input, with 390 mL of blood products given. The total output includes 2,739 mL of urine, 800 mL of NG drainage, and 482 mL of TF drainage. The patient received 1,632 mL of IV fluids and had a blood product transfusion of 238 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 491 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears to be in no acute distress. The eyes/conjunctiva are PERRL, and the head, ears, nose, and throat examination reveals normocephaly and the absence of endotracheal or NG tubes. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. The respiratory/chest examination notes symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds.

   failure, likely secondary to aspiration event.
   Respiratory Failure: Off antibiotics, related to aspiration event and
   subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **]. Self-extubated last night but appears stable on NC.
   - Plan for trach to prevent complications of expected future aspiration
   events. For OR, needs plt>80 and INR<1.5; Vit K 5 mg po x 3 days.
   Thoracics following -> will call and
   - Plan for GI guided [**Last Name (un) **]-hoff tomorrow (given esophageal varices and
   risk for bleeding)
   Hypotension: BP now stable since discontinuation of the lasix gtt.
   Stably elevated WBC with less concern for sepsis given absence of fever
   or left shift on diff today, negative cultures, and no evidence of SBP
   on paracentesis.
   - Cautious IV fluid boluses if necessary for MAPs < 55

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. He has had multiple ICU transfers and is now admitted intubated to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypernatremia, and alcohol abuse. He also has a history of grade II esophageal varices that have been banded.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient underwent several procedures including paracentesis, which did not show evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He was started on subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and received diagnostic paracentesis without any complications.

The patient self-extubated overnight but appears stable on a nasal cannula. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 106/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 145 mEq/L, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with ETOH cirrhosis and recurrent aspiration who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He self-extubated last night but has remained off the ventilator. The patient has a history of allergies to Haldol and Ativan, and is currently taking various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, rifaximin, B12, MVI, chlorhexidine, and lactulose. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. Fluid balance shows a positive total input of 3,164 mL and a negative total output of 2,739 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and oriented mental status. Lab results show slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is stable, but he remains at high risk for aspiration and reintubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of recurrent aspiration, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and worsen his current condition.
2. Reintubation: The patient's risk for reintubation is high"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient has a history of esophageal banding for variceal bleed and presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**]. 

The patient's current condition is stable with no acute distress. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications as needed.

The patient has a central venous line (CVL) in place and previously had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line that was stopped due to growth of gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient was started on meropenem for the GNR infection and continues to receive this antibiotic while awaiting sensitivities. Blood cultures are pending, with all other microbiological samples being negative except for yeast in urine and sputum. The patient has not received steroids since [**6-17**], so the current leukocytosis is unlikely to be related to steroid use.

The patient's abdominal distention is noted, and there is a concern for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. He has been off antibiotics but recently developed leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count. A gram-negative rod (GNR) was grown from one of two sets of blood cultures drawn from the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC). All other microorganisms have been negative except for yeast in the urine and sputum. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and he has been on prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. He has a history of esophageal varices and underwent banding. The patient self-extubated and has been managing secretions well. There is ongoing discussion about the need for tracheostomy placement to facilitate future management of aspiration events. The patient's family would also like him to have a tracheostomy and feeding tube so that he can go to rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and GNR growing in the blood culture. This suggests the possibility of a bacterial infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration events leading to respiratory failure. There is a discussion about tracheostomy placement to prevent future aspiration events. Monitoring his respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has been diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. He is currently extubated and has an ileus. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing altered mental status. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has leukocytosis. He also has electrolyte and fluid imbalances, including hypernatremia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's family wants him to have a tracheostomy and feeding tube so he can go to rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to the ileus and impaired gas exchange.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be a result of hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver dysfunction.
3. Infection: Sepsis is already present, and there is a risk of developing further infections due to the ileus and compromised immune system.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutrition and inability to eat orally could lead to malnutrition, which can delay healing and recovery.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient self-extubated but appears stable on non-invasive ventilation (NC). The plan is to perform a tracheostomy to prevent complications of future aspiration events. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg and heart rate of 109 bpm. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. He has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg and is receiving IV fluids. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.0 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 48. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is off antibiotics, related to aspiration event and subsequent self-extubation. A tracheostomy is planned to prevent future aspiration events.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is now stable since discontinuation of lasix gtt. Cautious IV fluid boluses will be given if necessary for mean arterial pressures (MAPs) < 55, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis and recurrent aspiration. He is currently in the ICU, where he is being treated for respiratory failure, bacteremia, hypernatremia, and liver cirrhosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/61 mmHg to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, lactulose, and vitamin B12. The patient's lab results show low white blood cell count, elevated potassium levels, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal liver enzyme levels. The patient is expected to continue receiving meropenem for his bacteremia and will undergo further evaluation to determine if peripheral lines can be discontinued. The patient's condition is described as critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count and elevated potassium levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is important.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's history of alcohol-related cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications associated with liver failure, such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of recurrent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. There are plans for rehab screening and intermittent suctioning.

The patient has a bacteremia caused by gram-negative rods sensitive to meropenem and gram-positive cocci from [**6-23**]. The patient is currently on vancomycin and meropenem. An attempt will be made today to obtain an ultrasound-guided peripheral or EJ, otherwise, the central line will be re-sited.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which has improved with free water flushes. The serum sodium level is stable at 146. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia have resolved, and the patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with NPH and HISS. The patient is also receiving folate/MVI for alcohol abuse.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 133/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's height is 69 inches, and weight is 101.7 kg. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 56 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and the need for multiple ICU transfers indicate a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia with gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci suggests a risk of infection-related complications, such as sepsis or septic shock.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated serum sodium level indicates a risk of dehydration or imbalances in electrolyte levels.
4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis increases the risk of complications related to liver dysfunction, such as hepatic encephalopathy or portal hypertension.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Although the patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, the underlying causes, including antibiotic use or acute illness, may still pose a risk for bleeding complications.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus requires careful management to avoid complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional information or tests may be required to fully assess the patient's condition and potential medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), cirrhosis, hypernatremia, and delirium. The patient is receiving antibiotics for the bacteremia and is being managed for his other medical conditions. He remains delirious and is expected to continue in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Bacteremia: If the infection is not effectively controlled, the bacteremia can progress and lead to sepsis, which can have serious consequences.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis can progress and result in complications such as portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver failure.
4. Hypernatremia: If not managed properly, the patient's hypernatremia can worsen and cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may persist or worsen, leading to an increased risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI): The presence of GPCs in the blood culture suggests a possible central line infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of confusion and delirium. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with sepsis without organ dysfunction. He has multiple medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, ascites, hyperglycemia, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient received Zydis 5 mg SL for agitation with improvement. He had difficulty obtaining right external jugular (EJ) access and the central line was uncomfortable to remove. Surveillance cultures were sent. The patient was on various infusions and medications including dextrose, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/54 mmHg to 136/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,757 mL with outputs of 2,195 mL (including 330 mL of blood products), resulting in a balance of 562 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with SpO2 at 99%.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration events. The patient has been self-extubated and has been managing secretions acceptably since then.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has gram-negative rods sensitive to meropenem and gram-positive cocci from previous cultures. He is currently on vancomycin and meropenem.

2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 146. This is being managed with free water flushes via NGT.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is unable to follow simple commands and exhibits asterixis.

5. Ascites: The patient has a distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave and bulging flanks.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood glucose levels.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin has not been assessed.

8. Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices.

9. Ileus: The patient has had difficulty with bowel movements.

10. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has widespread bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities on chest X-ray, which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, with or without superimposed process such as infection or aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may progress to organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.

2. Infection: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and is at risk of developing further infections.

3. Aspiration: The patient has had previous aspiration events and is at risk of recurrent aspiration.

4. Liver failure: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis may progress to liver failure, leading to worsening hepatic encephalopathy and other complications.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of low platelet count, which may recur if not managed appropriately.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.

7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.

8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify and manage any potential medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and a history of hepatic encephalopathy. He presented with respiratory failure due to an aspiration event and required multiple ICU transfers. The patient has been managed with intermittent suctioning since extubation. He has a diagnosis of bacteremia, currently being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. The patient also has alcoholic cirrhosis with complications of hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices, which were banded. He has hypernatremia that improved with free water flushes and is being monitored. His thrombocytopenia has resolved. The patient has diabetes mellitus and is on standing NPH with HISS and dextrose prn. He is also being monitored for alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and subsequent respiratory failure indicates a potential for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, which is being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis if the current treatment is not effective.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated serum sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. If not"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who has undergone esophageal banding for variceal bleed.
- He presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration events.
- The patient was intubated three times and recently self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**].
- He is currently managing secretions acceptably without a tracheostomy.
- The patient has bacteremia caused by Enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem, and gram-positive cocci not yet speciated. He is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and subsequent intubations indicate a high risk for recurrent episodes of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and timely intervention may be required.
2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia, particularly with Enterobacter and gram-positive cocci, increases the risk of developing further infections. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotics is essential.
3. Liver Disease: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient has undergone esophageal banding for variceal bleed and has had multiple ICU transfers. He was intubated three times and recently self-extubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure related to aspiration, bacteremia with a sensitive organism to meropenem, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and meropenem, and has been managing secretions acceptably since extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's history of aspiration events, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with a gram-positive cocci not yet speciated, and is currently on vancomycin and meropenem. There is a possibility of developing further infections or resistance to antibiotics.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, which can affect the patient's mental status and cognitive functions.
4. Variceal bleeding: Although the patient has undergone esophageal banding, there is still a risk of variceal bleeding, especially if the bands become dislodged or new"

   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], requiring
   multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure in the setting of
   aspiration events.
   Respiratory Failure: Related to aspiration event and subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Plan had been for trach placement to facilitate management of expected
   future aspiration events but self-extubated [**2172-6-22**] and has been
   managing secretions acceptably since extubation.
   - No plans for tracheostomy at present
   - intermittent suction
   - rehab screening
   Bacteremia:  Patient with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem on [**6-22**]
   and gram positive cocci not yet speciated from [**6-23**].  Currently on
   vancomycin and meropenem.  Patient continues to have IJ in place.  Able
   to place right EJ 18 g yesterday but difficulty obtaining this
   peripheral line and need for further access made us reluctant to remove
   central line.  Currently not safe to place central line given patient
   encephalopathy.
   - await speciation of gram positive cocci.  If not contaminant will
   need to remove IJ
   - vancomycin and meropenem
   - follow up surveillance cultures
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   Dobhoff now in place for tube feeds.
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypernatremia: Improved with free water flushes.  Serum sodium stable
   at 146.
   - Continue free water flushes via NGT
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion inducated.
   Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely [**1-27**] to BM suppression from abx
   (vanco, meropenem) or acute illness, although may have component from
   underlying liver disease.
   - Monitor while in meropenem
   Diabetes Mellitus: Standing NPH with HISS, dextrose prn FS<70
   - titrate insulin as necessary

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. 

The patient currently has several medical conditions and complications that require close monitoring and management:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for future aspiration events, and tracheostomy placement was initially planned but is no longer needed due to the patient's ability to manage secretions post-extubation.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has enterobacter sensitive to meropenem, and gram-positive cocci not yet speciated from [**6-23**]. He is currently on vancomycin and meropenem.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that were banded. He is on rifaximin and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and tube feeds are being continued.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium has stabilized at 146 after free water flushes. Continuing free water flushes via NGT is part of the plan.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is at baseline, and no transfusion is indicated.

   meropenem.  Patient continues to have IJ in place.  Able to place right
   EJ 18 g yesterday but difficulty obtaining this peripheral line and
   need for further access made us reluctant to remove central line.  Now
   PICC in place.
   - Pull IJ and EJ
   - await speciation of gram positive cocci; if contaminant, d/c vanc.
   - continue meropenem
   - follow up surveillance cultures
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   Dobhoff now in place for tube feeds.
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypernatremia: Improved with free water flushes.  Serum sodium stable
   at 146.
   - continue free water flushes via NGT
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion inducated.
   Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely [**1-27**] to BM suppression from abx
   (vanco, meropenem) or acute illness, although may have component from
   underlying liver disease.
   - monitor while on meropenem
   Diabetes Mellitus: Standing NPH with HISS, dextrose prn FS<70
   - titrate insulin as necessary
   Alcohol abuse: Folate/MVI

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events.
- The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then.
- There are plans for intermittent suction and rehab screening.
- The patient has a bacteremia caused by enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. They are currently on vancomycin and meropenem.
- The patient also has IJ and EJ in place, with the intention to pull them and await speciation of gram-positive cocci. If it turns out to be a contaminant, vancomycin will be discontinued.
- The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that have been banded.
- A Dobhoff tube has been placed for tube feeds.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which has improved with free water flushes. Serum sodium is stable at 146.
- The patient's anemia is currently at baseline, and no transfusion is indicated.
- Thrombocytopenia has resolved, likely due to bone marrow suppression from antibiotics or acute illness.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus and requires insulin management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan for tracheostomy has been put on hold, and intermittent suctioning is being done instead. The patient is currently planned for discharge to rehab on Monday.

The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which was sensitive to meropenem. He also had coag-negative staph bacteremia but is now negative. He is currently on meropenem and has a PICC line in place. The intrajugular catheter has been removed, and the tip is negative.

The patient is being treated for alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. He underwent banding for grade II esophageal varices. A Dobhoff tube has been placed for tube feeds and GI medications. The patient is also on rifaximin, lactulose, and IV PPI.

Hypernatremia is present, and the patient is receiving increased free water flushes via NGT. His anemia is at baseline, and he does not require a transfusion. Thrombocytopenia has resolved, likely due to bone marrow suppression from antibiotics or acute illness. The"

They also have alcoholic cirrhosis with complications of hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that have been banded. The patient has hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. The patient's current medications include Haldol, Ativan, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and various other ICU medications. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs are stable with a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's overall condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise, including aspiration pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. He self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] and has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan for tracheostomy has been put on hold, and he will continue intermittent suctioning. The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae and coag-negative Staphylococcus, both of which were sensitive to meropenem. He is currently on meropenem and a PICC line has been placed, with the inferior vena cava (IVC) filter removed. The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. He is receiving tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube and will continue rifaximin, lactulose, and IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient also has hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. He is being monitored closely, and various prophylactic measures are in place to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- They have an electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, ascites, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.
- Other issues include ileus, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, and a history of altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial condition was sepsis without organ dysfunction. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and potentially result in septic shock.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte disorder indicated by abnormal sodium levels. This imbalance can affect various bodily functions, including muscle control and nerve function.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an immune response to an infection or inflammation. Monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration, altered mental status, and potentially lead to complications like seizures or stroke.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, electrolyte imbalances,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been in the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. He has a history of grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this hospitalization. The patient is currently on meropenem for bacteremia caused by enterobacter and coag-negative staph. He also has hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. The plan is to discharge the patient to rehab on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and subsequent respiratory failure indicate a high risk for future respiratory complications.
2. Bacteremia: The patient currently has bacteremia caused by enterobacter and coag-negative staph. There is a risk of further infections if the bacteria become resistant to the current antibiotic treatment.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk for recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, which can affect his mental status and overall functioning.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent esophageal banding for variceal bleeding. He presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers due to respiratory failure resulting from aspiration events. The patient was intubated three times but self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**]. He has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan for tracheostomy placement has been temporarily put on hold. 

The patient has a current diagnosis of respiratory failure, possibly related to aspiration events and previous intubation attempts. He also has bacteremia caused by enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. The gram-positive cocci, which appeared to be vancomycin-resistant, have been discontinued. 

The patient is being managed for alcoholic cirrhosis with medications such as rifaximin, lactulose, PPI, and multivitamins. In the ICU, he is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at a rate of 70 mL/hour via Dopamine. His glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has two lines inserted - an 18-gauge line on [**2172-6-26**] and a PICC line on [**2172-6-26**]. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent esophageal banding for variceal bleeding.
- He presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**] and required multiple ICU transfers due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration events.
- The patient was intubated three times but self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**].
- Current plan is to manage secretions intermittently without tracheostomy.
- The patient has bacteremia caused by enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. The gram-positive cocci were vancomycin-sensitive and discontinued.
- The patient is on rifaximin, lactulose, PPI, and multivitamins for alcoholic cirrhosis.
- In the ICU, the patient is receiving fiber source nutrition through a dophoeffel tube and regular insulin for glycemic control.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous UF heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to aspiration events. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if proper airway management is not maintained.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been in the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan is to discharge him to rehab on Monday and not perform a tracheostomy. The patient has bacteremia caused by enterobacter and coag-negative staph, which is currently being treated with meropenem. He also has complications from alcoholic cirrhosis, including grade II esophageal varices that have been banded. His tremor/asterixis has increased today, but his stooling is well. He is being treated with rifaximin, lactulose, and tube feeds. The patient had hypernatremia, which has been normalized with free water repletion. He has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression from antibiotics or acute illness. The patient also has diabetes mellitus and a history of alcohol abuse. He is being monitored for diarrhea, likely caused by lactulose, and will be checked for C. diff. The patient is on ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   58y.o. M with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p esophageal banding for variceal
   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], requiring
   multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure in the setting of
   aspiration events.
   Respiratory Failure: Related to aspiration event and subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Plan had been for trach placement to facilitate management of expected
   future aspiration events but self-extubated [**2172-6-22**] and has been
   managing secretions acceptably since extubation.
   - No plans for tracheostomy at present
   - Intermittent suction
   - Plan for discharge to rehab on Monday
   Bacteremia: Patient with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem on [**6-22**].
   Coag negative staph from [**6-23**].  Currently on meropenem.  Now PICC in
   place and IJ removed, tip cx negative
   - D/c vancomycin
   - continue meropenem x 14 day course (last day [**7-6**])
   - follow up surveillance cultures
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis/ hepatic encephalopathy: Complicated by grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   Dobhoff now in place for tube feeds and GI meds. Increased
   tremor/asterixis today but stooling well.
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose (dose decreased to avoid skipped doses)
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypernatremia: Increased free water flushes for serum sodium of 148.
   - continue free water flushes via NGT
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion inducated.
   Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely [**1-27**] to BM suppression from abx
   (vanco, meropenem) or acute illness, although may have component from
   underlying liver disease.
   - monitor while on meropenem
   Diabetes Mellitus: Standing NPH with HISS, dextrose prn FS<70
   - titrate insulin as necessary
   Alcohol abuse: Folate/MVI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been in the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. There are no plans for tracheostomy at present.

The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by enterobacter, which was sensitive to meropenem, and coag-negative staph from [**6-23**]. He is currently on meropenem and his central line has been changed.

The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy have been complicated by grade II esophageal varices that underwent banding. The patient has increased tremor/asterixis today but is stooling well. He will continue with rifaximin, lactulose (dose decreased to avoid skipped doses), tube feeds, and IV PPI.

The patient's hypernatremia has been addressed by increasing free water flushes for a serum sodium of 148. He will continue with free water flushes via NGT.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia have resolved, and his diabetes mellitus will be managed with standing NPH with HISS, dextrose prn FS<70, and titration of insulin as necessary.

   bleed, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**], requiring
   multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure in the setting of
   aspiration events.
   Respiratory Failure: Related to aspiration event and subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Plan had been for trach placement to facilitate management of expected
   future aspiration events but self-extubated [**2172-6-22**] and has been
   managing secretions acceptably since extubation.
   - Plan for discharge to rehab on Monday
   - Tracheostomy not indicated
   - Intermittent suction
   Bacteremia: Patient with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem on [**6-22**].
   Coag negative staph from [**6-23**].  Currently on meropenem.  Now PICC in
   place and IJ removed, tip cx negative.
   - continue meropenem x 14 day course (last day [**7-6**])
   - follow up surveillance cultures
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy: Complicated by grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   Dobhoff now in place for tube feeds and GI meds. Increased
   tremor/asterixis today but stooling well.
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose (dose decreased to decrease number of
   skipped doses)
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypernatremia: Serum Na now normalized with free water repletion
   although still with large losses via stools
   - continue free water flushes 200cc q2h via NGT
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na check
    Anemia: Currently at baseline, no transfusion indicated.
   Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely [**1-27**] to BM suppression from
   antibiotics or acute illness, although may have component from

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had a previous episode of respiratory failure, which necessitated a plan for tracheostomy placement to manage future aspiration events. However, the patient self-extubated, and the need for tracheostomy is no longer indicated.

2. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae on [**2172-6-22**] and coag-negative Staphylococcus from [**2172-6-23**]. The patient is currently on meropenem, and the PICC line tip culture was negative.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by grade II esophageal varices, which were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. The patient continues on rifaximin and lactulose (dose decreased) to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels were elevated due to large losses via stools. Free water repletion has normalized the sodium levels, and the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. He has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. Tracheostomy placement is not planned at present. The patient has bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae and Coag negative staph, both of which are sensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently on meropenem and has a PICC line in place, with an internal jugular (IJ) line removed. The tip of the IJ line was negative for infection. The patient's condition is complicated by grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. He has increased tremor/asterixis but is stooling well. The patient's serum sodium is elevated at 148, likely due to large stool output. Fluid and electrolyte management is ongoing. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, both of which are being monitored. He also has diabetes mellitus, for which he is receiving NPH with HISS and dextrose as needed. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to continue in the ICU with plans to discharge him to rehab on Monday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. He presented with hepatic encephalopathy on [**2172-5-10**] and required intubation. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions well since then. He is currently stable on RA (respiratory assistance) and only requires intermittent suctioning. The plan for tracheostomy has been put on hold.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events has led to multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient initially presented with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease.
3. Bacteremia: The patient had an infection caused by enterobacter, which was sensitive to meropenem. Gram-positive cocci, initially identified as vancomycin-resistant, have been discontinued due to sensitivity to meropenem.
4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is a chronic liver disease caused by excessive alcohol consumption. This condition may lead to complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient has been intubated three times and is currently self-extubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure related to aspiration, bacteremia treated with meropenem, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The plan is to continue with meropenem and monitor the patient's platelet count. The patient is also on rifaximin, lactulose, PPI, and folate for alcoholic cirrhosis. The patient's mental status is improving, and they are expected to be transferred to rehabilitation on Monday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration events
2. Bacteremia, which has been treated with meropenem but may require further monitoring and treatment
3. Alcoholic cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is currently being managed with medications like rifaximin, lactulose, PPI, and folate to control these complications.
4. Potential need for tracheostomy in the future to manage secretions and prevent further aspiration events.
5. Risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as boots"

   Disposition: ICU with plan to d/c to Rehab today
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] and has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan for the patient today is to screen for rehab, as tracheostomy is not indicated. Intermittent suction will be used to manage secretions.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, hypernatremia (high sodium), altered mental status (not delirium), ascites, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's medical history includes alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, grade II esophageal varices, bacteremia, coag-negative staph infection, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current medications include rifaximin, lactulose (dose decreased), tube feeds, IV PPI, and NPH with HISS for diabetes management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to aspiration events, hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation, gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, infections due to immunocompromised state or indwelling lines, and worsening renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient had multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. 

The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, ascites, hyperglycemia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, ileus, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's treatment plan includes discharge to rehab today, tracheostomy not indicated, intermittent suction, continuation of meropenem for 14 days, follow-up surveillance cultures, continued rifaximin and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, continued tube feeds, and continued IV PPI. The patient's hypernatremia has been normalized with free water repletion, and he will continue with free water flushes every 2 hours via NGT. His sodium levels will be checked every 6 hours and adjusted as needed.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia will be monitored. His diabetes mellitus will be managed with NPH and HISS, and insulin will be titrated as necessary. The patient will also receive folate/MVI for alcohol abuse and lactulose for diarrhea.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan for discharge to rehab on Monday has been made, and tracheostomy is not indicated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had previous episodes of respiratory failure, which were related to aspiration events. There is a risk of recurrence, especially if proper airway management is not maintained.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by enterobacter, which was sensitive to meropenem. The infection was treated with meropenem, and the patient is currently on a 14-day course of this antibiotic. Surveillance cultures will be followed up to ensure clearance of the infection.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. There is a risk of further complications such as variceal bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia that was normalized with free water repletion. It is important to continue monitoring serum sodium levels and adjust fluid intake accordingly to prevent further electroly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient's current condition includes AMS (altered mental status), hepatic encephalopathy, multiple infections, and various other medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and fluid imbalance, indicating a disturbance in electrolyte and fluid balance within the body.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an immune response to infection or inflammation.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, which may be due to stress from illness or inadequate insulin regulation.

5. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's AMS is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs as a result of liver dysfunction.

6. Ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, which is commonly associated with liver cirrhosis.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or bed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. He has been intubated three times but is currently self-extubated and doing well. The plan was for tracheostomy placement, but the patient declined and has been managing secretions acceptably since extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and previous intubations indicate a risk for respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had an enterobacter infection that was sensitive to meropenem. Although the bacteremia resolved, there is a potential risk for new infections.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and is being managed with medications such as rifaximin and lactulose. Complications related to cirrhosis can include hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and liver failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hypernatremia, which has since resolved. Monitoring electrolyte levels and fluid balance is important to prevent further imbalances.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis, indicating an elevated white blood cell count. This may suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and has been in the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The plan is to screen the patient for rehab today and not to perform a tracheostomy. Intermittent suctioning will be done instead.

The patient has bacteremia with Enterobacter sensitive to meropenem, which was started on [**6-22**]. Another infection caused by coag-negative staphylococci was identified on [**6-23**]. The patient is currently on meropenem, and a PICC line has been placed, with the inferior vena cava (IVC) filter removed. The tip of the IVC filter was cultured for coag-negative staphylococci. The antibiotic course will be continued for 14 days, and follow-up surveillance cultures will be done.

The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. A Dobhoff tube has been placed for tube feeds and GI medications. The patient has an increased tremor/asterixis today but is stooling well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. Tracheostomy is not indicated at this time. The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by enterobacter and coag-negative staph, and is currently on meropenem. The patient's condition is complicated by grade II esophageal varices, for which he underwent banding. He has increased tremor/asterixis but is stooling well. The patient's serum sodium has normalized with free water repletion, although he still has large losses via stools. He was transfused 1 unit of PRBC yesterday due to gradually down-trending Hct. His platelet count is slowly trending down since meropenem was restarted. The patient has diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and diarrhea (likely caused by lactulose). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration events leading to respiratory failure, and there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has had bacteremia in the past and is currently on meropenem. There is a risk of developing another infection while on antibiotics.
3. Esophageal Varices"

   Respiratory Failure: Related to aspiration event and subsequent [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Plan had been for trach placement to facilitate management of expected
   future aspiration events but self-extubated [**2172-6-22**] and has been
   managing secretions acceptably since extubation
   - Tracheostomy not indicated
   - Intermittent suction
   Bacteremia: Patient with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem on [**6-22**].
   Coag negative staph from [**6-23**].  Currently on meropenem.  Now PICC in
   place and IJ removed, tip cx negative.
   - continue meropenem x 14 day course (last day [**7-6**])
   - follow up surveillance cultures
   Alcoholic Cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy: Complicated by grade II
   esophageal varices s/p banding on this prolonged hospitalization.
   Dobhoff now in place for tube feeds and GI meds. Increased
   tremor/asterixis today but stooling well.
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose (dose decreased to decrease number of
   skipped doses)
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypernatremia: Serum Na now normalized with free water repletion
   although still with large losses via stools
   - continue free water flushes 300 q 4H per NGt
   - daily sodium checks
    Anemia: Slowly trending down over last several days. Transfused 1 unit
   yesterday.
   - monitor.
   - guaiac all stools
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-27**] to BM suppression from antibiotics or
   acute illness, less likely [**1-27**] underlying liver disease as plt count
   improved once off abx. Now plt again slowly downtrending since

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure related to aspiration events. The patient self-extubated on [**2172-6-22**] but has been managing secretions acceptably since then. The patient has grade II esophageal varices that were banded during this prolonged hospitalization. The patient is currently on meropenem for bacteremia and is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's sodium levels have normalized with free water repletion, and he has been transfused 1 unit of PRBCs due to gradually down-trending Hct. The patient's platelet count is slowly downtrending since meropenem was restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration events. There is a risk of recurrence if appropriate measures are not taken.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, currently being treated with meropenem. It is important to continue the antibiotic course as planned and follow up with surveillance cultures.
4. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as es"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. The patient was intubated three times and is currently self-extubated. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, bacteremia, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypernatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration events leading to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if proper measures are not taken to prevent aspiration.
2. Bacteremia: The patient was diagnosed with enterobacter bacteremia and is being treated with meropenem. If the infection does not respond to the current treatment, there may be a risk of complications such as sepsis or septic shock.
3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. These complications need to be managed carefully to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has since resolved. Monitoring the patient's sodium levels is important to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anemia: The patient is anemic, likely due to phlebotomy and critical illness. It is important to monitor and treat the anemia appropriately to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hepatic encephalopathy and required multiple ICU transfers for respiratory failure due to aspiration events. He was intubated three times and recently self-extubated but is managing secretions well since then. The plan for tracheostomy has been put on hold, and the patient is stable on RA (restraints) and intermittent suction. He has accepted rehab and is expected to be transferred there soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration events and previous intubations suggest a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had a previous bacteremia caused by Enterobacter species, which was sensitive to meropenem. Although the current microbiology results are negative, there is still a risk of developing another infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of cirrhosis increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy indicates a potential for future episodes, which can affect mental status and cognitive function.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to poor oral intake and the need for enteral feeding.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at increased risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous cath"
