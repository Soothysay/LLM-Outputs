   CHIEF COMPLAINT: Respiratory distress
   .
   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
   Pt is a 69 yo female diagnosed with MDS s/p cycle 5 (day 18) of
   azacytodine chemotherapy who was admitted on [**12-18**] for neutropenic
   fever, non productive cough, profound anemia HCT 13.6, diarrhea, and
   was being treated for PNA.  The ICU team was called to evaluate the
   patient for development of respiratory distress in the setting of
   several blood transfusions over the last 2 days.  She desaturated this
   AM to the 80s on 3-4L NC.  She was placed on a NRB with 02 sats of 98%,
   an ABG was 7.31/43/73, tachypnic to the high 30s, originally in tripod
   position, and with crackles throughout the lungs.  She received 20mg IV
   lasix and put out 600cc of urine. She later put out a total of 1100cc
   of urine prior to transfer to the ICU and was no longer in tripod
   position but still with a RR in the high 30s and using accessory
   muscles. Pt + for cough that is midly productive but was unable to
   describe the sputum. She reported that she was getting fatigued with
   her breathing. Of note pt spiked to 102.3 overnight.  I/Os not recorded
   yesterday due to pt with BRP.
   .
   Review of systems + for brown diarrhea x1 week, cough x1 week, swelling
   of feet during recent trip. Negative for nasal congestion, chest pain,
   n/v, abd pain, weakness, numbness, tingling
   .

   to 60,000 units weekly with no improvement in her red cell
   transfusion requirement.
   --Received Cycle 1 azacitidine chemotherapy [**2114-7-9**] through
   [**2114-7-13**]. Cycle 2 administered [**Date range (1) 9411**]; delayed by one week
   due to neutropenia. Cycle 3 administered [**Date range (1) 9412**]; again
   delayed by one week due to neutropenia. Cycle 4 administered

   STUDIES:
   CXR [**2114-12-18**]:
   IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2114-1-15**]:
   Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the left upper
   lobe.
   Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1143**], now reexpanded and densely
   consolidated. There may be left hilar adenopathy and small left pleural
   effusion. Overall, findings are consistent with extensive pneumonia
   though under the appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be
   infiltrated malignancy. Small region of ground-glass opacity in the
   right apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
   Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung shows some
   mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe pulmonary edema is
   playing any role.
   .
   CXR [**2114-12-20**]:
   PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiomegaly persists. Motion limits
   this film. Within this limitation, there has been progression of a
   patchy multifocal air space opacity affecting the left lung. Focal
   opacification in the right upper lung laterally is stable since [**2113**].
   There may be a small left effusion. No pneumothorax. Scoliosis
   persists.
   COMMENT: Focality favors infection over asymmetric pulmonary edema or
   TRALI.
   .
   Echo [**2114-1-5**]:
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   .
   Abd ultrasound [**2114-12-19**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
   2. Small amount of free perihepatic fluid.
   3. Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid. These findings could be due to a variery of
   chronic conditions including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in
   hepatitis. There is no evidence to suggest acute inflammation.

   transfusions.  Now with worsening PNA on CXR.
   .
   #. Resp distress: Likely a combination of worsening PNA and flash pulm
   edema in the setting of multiple blood transfusion (5 total since
   admission and one overnight). Must also consider TRALI given pt with
   recent blood transfusion and with fever.  Responded well to 40 IV lasix
   and suggesting flash pulm edema. CXR suggests worsening PNA given
   increased fluid would be more bilateral. Pt febrile and neutropenic on
   arrival to clinic on [**2114-12-18**]. DFA negative on admission.   Respiratory
   status has improved with lasix- pt now on high flow face mask but no

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of recent blood transfusions. She has a history of neutropenic fever, pneumonia, profound anemia, diarrhea, and is currently being treated for pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the administration of IV lasix, and she is now on a high-flow face mask but no longer requires the NRB. She is febrile and neutropenic.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be a combination of worsening pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of multiple blood transfusions. It is important to consider TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) given the recent blood transfusion and fever.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening pneumonia is evident on the chest X-ray, and she requires continued antibiotic coverage with levofloxacin for additional pseudomonas coverage, along with cefepime and vancomycin.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of sideroblastic anemia and MDS. Her hematocrit (HCT) was 13.9 on admission, and she has received 5 units of red blood cells since admission with a current HCT of 23.2. The goal is to maintain a HCT above 21 as per oncology"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with myelodysplastic syndrome who presented to the clinic with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia, diarrhea, and pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress after recent blood transfusions and is now showing clinical improvement after diuresis with reduced O2 requirement. However, there is still radiographic evidence of an infectious pulmonary process, likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient has a history of sideroblastic anemia and MDS, with a current hemoglobin concentration of 21.0% and a goal of 21% according to oncology recommendations. She has received 5 units of packed red blood cells since admission.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, slightly decreased platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and low albumin levels. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Hepatitis serologies are negative, and an ultrasound revealed hepatic abnormalities.

The patient has been afebrile overnight and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever. Her respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of worsening pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of multiple blood transfusions. TRALI should also be considered given the recent blood transfusion and presence of fever.

The patient's diarrhea has resolved since yesterday. Her electrolyte levels are being monitored, and"

   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
   Pt is a 69 yo female diagnosed with MDS s/p cycle 5 (day 18) of
   azacytodine chemotherapy who was admitted on [**12-18**] for neutropenic
   fever, non productive cough, profound anemia HCT 13.6, diarrhea, and
   was being treated for PNA.  The ICU team was called to evaluate the
   patient for development of respiratory distress in the setting of
   several blood transfusions over the last 2 days.  She desaturated this
   AM to the 80s on 3-4L NC.  She was placed on a NRB with 02 sats of 98%,
   an ABG was 7.31/43/73, tachypnic to the high 30s, originally in tripod
   position, and with crackles throughout the lungs.  She received 20mg IV
   lasix and put out 600cc of urine. She later put out a total of 1100cc
   of urine prior to transfer to the ICU and was no longer in tripod
   position but still with a RR in the high 30s and using accessory
   muscles. Pt + for cough that is midly productive but was unable to
   describe the sputum. She reported that she was getting fatigued with
   her breathing. Of note pt spiked to 102.3 overnight.  I/Os not recorded
   yesterday due to pt with BRP.

   STUDIES:
   CXR [**2114-12-18**]:
   IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2114-1-15**]:
   Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the left upper
   lobe.
   Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1143**], now reexpanded and densely
   consolidated. There may be left hilar adenopathy and small left pleural
   effusion. Overall, findings are consistent with extensive pneumonia
   though under the appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be
   infiltrated malignancy. Small region of ground-glass opacity in the
   right apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
   Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung shows some
   mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe pulmonary edema is
   playing any role.
   .
   CXR [**2114-12-20**]:
   PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiomegaly persists. Motion limits
   this film. Within this limitation, there has been progression of a
   patchy multifocal air space opacity affecting the left lung. Focal
   opacification in the right upper lung laterally is stable since [**2113**].
   There may be a small left effusion. No pneumothorax. Scoliosis
   persists.
   COMMENT: Focality favors infection over asymmetric pulmonary edema or
   TRALI.
   .
   Echo [**2114-1-5**]:
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   .
   Abd ultrasound [**2114-12-19**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
   2. Small amount of free perihepatic fluid.
   3. Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid. These findings could be due to a variery of
   chronic conditions including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in
   hepatitis. There is no evidence to suggest acute inflammation.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presents with respiratory distress, neutropenic fever, profound anemia, diarrhea, and pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of recent blood transfusions. 

The patient's symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, crackles diffusely bilaterally in the lungs, use of accessory muscles in breathing, and speaking in several-word sentences but stopping to breathe. Her vital signs show a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Her past medical history includes pneumonia, pericarditis, bilateral neuroma, migraines, plantar fasciitis, shingles, tonsillectomy, and multiple skin cancers. She is currently on several medications including albuterol, guaifenesin, acetaminophen, magnesium sulfate replacement, cefepime, vancomycin, aspirin, and prochlorperazine.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 113 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 107 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST).

The assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to worsening pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of multiple blood transfusions. The patient's anemia is due to MDS and recent blood transfusions. There is also evidence of transaminitis with elevated liver enzymes and hepatic ultrasound showing free perihepatic fluid, collapsed gallbladder with wall edema, and small amount of pericholecystic fluid. The patient has neutropenic fever secondary to recent chemotherapy, and diarrhea is still occurring.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Responded well with clinical improvement
   to diuresis.  Etiology of acute respiratory failure secondary to volume
   overload in setting of multiple blood transfusions superimposed on
   pneumonia.  CXR with increased confluence of infiltrates on the left
   related to evolving pneumonia, may increase as her counts come back.
   On vanco/cefipime/levo.  Now on nasal cannula. Stable for transfer back
   to the OMED floor.  Repleting phos and K, repeat electrolytes this
   afternoon.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC:  Hct stable overnight.  No need for transfusion.
   Following [**Hospital1 **] CBCs.  She should get lasix with further blood
   transfusions to avoid volume overload and respiratory compromise.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with acute on chronic respiratory failure. She was previously diagnosed with pneumonia and had received antibiotics (vancomycin, cefipime, and levofloxacin) for treatment. The patient underwent diuresis overnight, resulting in a negative fluid balance of approximately 2.2 liters. This led to improved breathing comfort. She is currently on a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/51 mmHg to 138/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received a total of 810 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 460 mL via the Foley catheter. She has also received blood transfusions totaling 3,100 mL, with an output of 550 mL via the Foley catheter. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bases of the lungs, and the patient's extremities show no edema. Her neurological assessment is incomplete due to lack of movement and tone assessment. Lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (RARS) who presented to the clinic with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia, diarrhea, and pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress after receiving multiple blood transfusions. The patient's current condition includes worsening pneumonia on chest X-ray, likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has shown clinical improvement with diuresis and reduced oxygen requirement. However, there is still evidence of an infectious pulmonary process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to worsening pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema due to multiple blood transfusions. TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) should also be considered given the recent blood transfusion and presence of fever.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has an infectious pulmonary process likely due to HAP. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage for HAP.
3. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): The patient has a pre-existing condition of MDS, which may contribute to her overall health complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of sideroblastic anemia and MDS, with a current Hct level of 21.0. Maintaining the target Hct level of 21 per oncology recommendations is crucial.
5. Transaminitis:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented to the clinic with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia, diarrhea, and pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress related to recent blood transfusions. The patient is currently experiencing worsening pneumonia as indicated by clinical and radiologic features.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially had a component of flash pulmonary edema due to multiple blood transfusions, but now this component is less prominent. However, the worsening pneumonia indicates ongoing respiratory distress, which may require further intervention.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with likely [**3-5**] multifocal pneumonia. It is important to monitor her response to the current antibiotic regimen and adjust treatment accordingly based on the results of pending cultures.

3. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): The patient has a history of MDS, which is characterized by abnormal production of blood cells. Management of MDS involves following oncology recommendations and closely monitoring hematocrit (HCT) levels.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of sideroblastic anemia and MDS. Her HCT level on admission was 13.9, and she has received 5 units of red blood cells (RBCs) since admission. Although her current"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to pneumonia. He has a history of chronic anemia and has been on antibiotics since admission. The patient's temperature is currently 38.9°C (102.5°F), heart rate is 71 beats per minute, blood pressure is 78/27 mmHg, respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple IV infusions including furosemide, and various medications. He has been receiving antibiotics, specifically levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his neurologic examination is also not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's troponin T levels are within normal range, and his kidney function appears to be normal based on creatinine levels. The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and chronic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening complication of infection.
2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and white blood cell count indicate potential organ dysfunction due to infection or sepsis.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, pneumonia, and dyspnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 71 bpm (normal range 70-113 bpm), blood pressure of 78/27 mmHg (normal range 78/41-124/75 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (normal range 16-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include codeine, with an unknown reaction. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was given on December 20th at 5:00 PM.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the creatinine level is elevated at 0.8 mg/dL, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The troponin-T level is below 0.01, suggesting no cardiac damage. Other lab values, such as glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient in the ICU has been experiencing new fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and wheezing last night. These symptoms improved with nebulizers. The patient is more comfortable this morning. The patient has allergies to codeine and unknown medications. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 12/20 at 5:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events above. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, indicated by symptoms such as fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, and findings on the chest X-ray. Antibiotics have been continued to treat the infection, and weaning of oxygen as tolerated is planned.
2. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Anemia, and Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt) may suggest MDS, anemia, and leukopenia. These conditions will be followed closely.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests ("
