   24 Hour Events:
   [**11-28**]
   - ABG on admission 7.25/72/130/33 but didn't look too ill. On BiPAP for
   4 hrs with repeat VBG 7.24/72/67/32  (difficult stick to get ABG).
   - 330am VBG 7.22/80/32/34
   - 600am VBG 7.28/67/41/33 --> improved
   - Trop bump as well so started on ACS protocol for NSTEMI
   - EKG showing: normal SR, normal intervals, no ST changes. totally
   normal.
   - ID recs: f/u vanco trough, stool for O+P and c.diff, if MRSA swab neg
   consider d/c vanc.
   - Renal: goal neg 1-2 liters starting with 80mg IV lasi, check AM tacro
   level.
   - Cardiology: continue heparin gtt for 48 hours, aspirin, Bblocker,
   plavix.  Only needs 1L off as he is not very fluid overloaded.
   - 4pm VBG still 7.27/65/45, continues to have stable CO2 retention.
   - 9pm patient only 330ccs negative for the day, so Lasix gtt started
   with goal 150ccs urine per hour.

   is
   still clearly visible, however, substantially less severe than on the
   previous
   radiograph. On today's image, presence of a small left-sided pleural
   effusion
   cannot be excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No
   evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan: 77 year old female with a history of end stage
   renal disease s/p renal transplant in [**2170**], coronary artery disease,
   type II diabetes and diastolic heart failure who initially presented
   with acute diastolic heart failure now transferred to the MICU for
   respiratory distress and fevers.
   Acute Respiratory Distress:  Most likely etiology is flash pulmonary
   edema, with CXR showing fluid overload, and BNP in admission 2584. CXR
   with initial improvement yesterday but appears somewhat worse this am,
   no evidence of PNA on CXR. ABG
s show persistent hypercarbia and
   hypoxia. Has been started on Lasix gtt.
   - Appreciate renal recs: goal 1-2L negative per day with IV Lasix gtt
   and follow tacro levels
   - Off Nitro gtt and systolics are within normal limits
   - Standing albuterol nebulizers
   - Diurese her today and get ABG later this pm and reassess
   Fevers:  Unclear etiology.  Most likely source is urinary tract
   infection given initial tenderness over graft and history of recent
   foley use but initial cultures were contaminated.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Influenza negative.  BK and CMV pending.  No sputum
   or stool cultures. WBC count improving since starting vancomycin and
   cefepime.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease, renal transplant in 2017, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted initially with acute diastolic heart failure and later transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and fevers. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, acute on chronic kidney injury, urinary tract infection, acute diastolic heart failure, and hypereosinophilia. She also has a history of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and persistent hypercarbia and hypoxia suggest a potential respiratory failure. The use of BiPAP and Lasix gtt indicates an attempt to manage fluid overload and improve oxygenation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. This may lead to further kidney injury if not managed appropriately.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's fevers and tenderness over the graft suggest a possible urinary tract infection. Ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary.
4. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's initial presentation of diastolic heart failure has worsened, as evidenced by her current symptoms and the need for diuresis.
5. Hypereosinophilia: The patient's elevated eosinophil count may indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of kidney and heart transplant, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with respiratory failure, acute heart failure (CHF), and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been receiving BiPAP, heparin gtt, furosemide (Lasix), and other medications as per the ACS protocol for NSTEMI. The patient's ABG values have shown improvement over time, with decreasing CO2 retention. The patient's vital signs are stable, although there are concerns about potential complications such as pneumonia and pleural effusion based on the imaging findings. The patient's lab results indicate elevated WBC, Hct, and troponin levels, while other lab values are within normal range. The patient's fluid balance is negative, and the renal function needs monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles on lung auscultation and decreased oxygen saturation may suggest an underlying pneumonia. 
2. Pleural Effusion: The imaging findings suggest a small left-sided pleural effusion, which needs further evaluation.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's high glucose levels indicate a need for careful monitoring and management of blood sugar levels.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, along with the negative fluid balance, suggest the possibility of"

   consider d/c vanc.
   - Renal: goal neg 1-2 liters starting with 80mg IV lasi, check AM tacro
   level.
   - Cardiology: continue heparin gtt for 48 hours, aspirin, Bblocker,
   plavix.  Only needs 1L off as he is not very fluid overloaded.
   - 4pm VBG still 7.27/65/45, continues to have stable CO2 retention.

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease, renal transplant, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, and diastolic heart failure. She presented initially with acute diastolic heart failure and was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and fevers. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to flash pulmonary edema, as indicated by her CXR showing fluid overload and a high BNP level on admission. Her ABG results show persistent hypercarbia and hypoxia. She has been started on Lasix gtt to manage fluid overload, and BiPAP has been tried with subsequent ABG monitoring. If the patient continues to be hypercarbic, intubation may be considered.

The patient's fevers are of unclear etiology, but a urinary tract infection is suspected given her recent Foley use and tenderness over the graft. Initial cultures were contaminated, but blood cultures are negative to date. Influenza testing was negative, and BK and CMV cultures are pending. The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for low-grade fevers and a declining WBC count.

The patient also has acute diastolic heart failure, with initial presentation attributed to diastolic heart failure and now presenting with acute worsening in the setting of systolic hypertension. She is on Lasix gtt with a goal of 1-2 liters per day, metoprolol 50 mg PO B"

   Assessment and Plan: 77 year old female with a history of end stage
   renal disease s/p renal transplant in [**2170**], coronary artery disease,
   type II diabetes and diastolic heart failure who initially presented
   with acute diastolic heart failure now transferred to the MICU for
   respiratory distress and fevers.
   Acute Respiratory Distress:  Most likely etiology is flash pulmonary
   edema, with CXR showing fluid overload, and BNP in admission 2584. CXR
   with initial improvement yesterday but appears somewhat worse this am,
   no evidence of PNA on CXR. ABG
s show persistent hypercarbia and
   hypoxia. Has been started on Lasix gtt.
   - Appreciate renal recs: goal 1-2L negative per day with IV Lasix gtt
   and follow tacro levels
   - Off Nitro gtt and systolics are within normal limits
   - Standing albuterol nebulizers
   - Diurese her today and get ABG later this pm and reassess
   Fevers:  Unclear etiology.  Most likely source is urinary tract
   infection given initial tenderness over graft and history of recent
   foley use but initial cultures were contaminated.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Influenza negative.  BK and CMV pending.  No sputum
   or stool cultures. WBC count improving since starting vancomycin and
   cefepime.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for low grade fevers and WBC count
   that was elevated but trending down
   - f/u BK and CMV
   - sputum and stool cultures
 ordered but not gathered yet
   - ID recs: f/u vanco trough, stool for O+P and c.diff, if MRSA swab neg
   consider d/c vanc.
   Acute Diastolic Heart Failure:  As above, initial presentation
   attribuated to diastolic heart failure and now she presents with acute
   worsening in the setting of systolic hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt with goal 1-2L/day
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg PO BID
   - strict I/Os
   - holding home diovan on floor
   Acute on chronic kidney injury s/p renal transplant in [**2170**].

   - continue cellcept
   - daily tacrolimus levels
   - holding bactrim while on broad spectrum antibiotics, but if Vanc is
   d/c
d after negative MRSA screen will consider adding back
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) **]
   - renally dosing medications
   Hypereosinophilia in blood on admission:
   - Add on am cortisol to this morning
s labs to assess whether there is
   adrenal insufficiency component to pt

   Type II Diabetes:  Labile blood sugars on the floor.  NPH lowered from
   34 U [**Hospital1 7**] to 26 [**Hospital1 7**].
   - continue NPH 26 U [**Hospital1 7**]
   - humalog sliding scale increased yesterday afternoon
   - F/u sugars and adjust accordingly
   Coronary Artery Disease:  s/p RCA stent.
   - Appreciate Cardiology recs: continue heparin gtt for 48 hours,
   aspirin, Bblocker, plavix.  Only needs 1L off as she is not very fluid
   overloaded.
   - Continue to trend Trop

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease, renal transplant, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, and diastolic heart failure. She initially presented with acute diastolic heart failure and was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and fevers. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute on chronic kidney injury, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypereosinophilia, type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory failure and history of diastolic heart failure increase the risk of pulmonary edema, which is already suggested by the presence of bilateral perihilar opacities and left pleural effusion on the chest X-ray.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease and renal transplant. The current acute on chronic kidney injury may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further deterioration in renal function.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recent Foley use, which increases the risk of UTI. If left untreated, the infection could lead to sepsis or spread to other parts of the body.

4. Hypercarbia: The patient's ABG results show persistent hypercarbia. If"

   Imaging: [**11-29**] CXR: increase in bilateral perihilar opacities and
   increase in the small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and associated
   left lower lobe  consolidation, suggesting moderate cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac consolidation of the left lower lobe is
   presumably caused by left lower lobe atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is
   stable since the prior study.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 .H/O TRANSPLANT, KIDNEY (RENAL TRANSPLANT)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Assessment and Plan: 77 year old female with a history of end stage
   renal disease s/p renal transplant in [**2170**], coronary artery disease,
   type II diabetes and diastolic heart failure who initially presented
   with acute diastolic heart failure now transferred to the MICU for
   respiratory distress and fevers.
   Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient appears much improved today and is
   off of BiPAP.  Most likely etiology is flash pulmonary edema, with CXR
   showing fluid overload, and BNP in admission 2584.  VBG
s yesterday
   showed persistent hypercarbia and hypoxia. Has been on Lasix gtt with
   excellent diuresis.
   - Switch to IV lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 7**] to allow for transfer to the floor.
   - Standing albuterol nebulizers
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Check VBG to get an idea of her baseline when she looks clinically
   good.
   Fevers:  Unclear etiology.  Most likely source is urinary tract
   infection given initial tenderness over graft and history of recent
   foley use but initial cultures were contaminated.  Appears to be
   pyelonephritis.  Urine cultures were negative, but were collected after
   starting abx. Blood cultures negative to date.  Influenza negative.  BK
   and CMV pending.  No sputum or stool cultures. We will narrow
   antibiotic coverage now that the MRSA screen was negative.
   - appreciate ID recs.
   - d/c vancomycin and continue cefepime.  Will need long course of
   antibiotics as this is an infected transplant kidney.  Will follow ID
   recs for course.
   - restart prophylactic bactrim.
   - f/u BK and CMV
   - sputum and stool cultures
 ordered but not gathered yet
   Acute Diastolic Heart Failure:  As above, initial presentation
   attribuated to diastolic heart failure and now she presents with acute
   worsening in the setting of systolic hypertension.
   - Lasix boluses as above.
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg PO BID
   - strict I/Os
   - restart home diovan at 80mg daily.
   Acute on chronic kidney injury s/p renal transplant in [**2170**].
   Creatinine now back to baseline between 2.0 and 2.8.
   - Tacro has been low, so we will increase dose to 3mg [**Hospital1 7**].
   - continue cellcept
   - continue daily tacrolimus levels
   - back on home bactrim for prophylaxis
   - renally dosing medications
   Hypereosinophilia in blood on admission:
   - f/u AM cortisol.
   Type II Diabetes:  Labile blood sugars on the floor.  NPH lowered from
   34 U [**Hospital1 7**] to 26 [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday, but now she is persistently
   hyperglycemic.  We will change NPH to 30 U [**Hospital1 7**].
   - continue NPH 30 U [**Hospital1 7**]
   - humalog sliding scale
   Coronary Artery Disease:  s/p RCA stent with elevated troponins.  Now
   48+ hours after so we have stopped heparin gtt and plavix.
   - switch back to aspirin 81 mg daily
   - continue atorvastatin 20 mg PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg PO BID
   - restart diovan at half dose.
   Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue tricor and atorvastatin
   FEN: Low sodium diet, monitor electrolytes, no IVF
   Prophylaxis: bowel regimen, SC heparin and pneumoboots.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Hypercarbia: The patient has persistent hypercarbia, which indicates elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be a sign of respiratory distress or failure.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress and was transferred to the MICU for further management. The most likely etiology is flash pulmonary edema, as evidenced by fluid overload on the chest X-ray and a high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level on admission.

3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and presented with acute worsening in the setting of systolic hypertension. Lasix boluses have been administered, and the patient is being continued on metoprolol for blood pressure control.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has fevers of unclear etiology. A urinary tract infection is suspected, possibly pyelonephritis, given the tenderness over the renal graft and history of recent Foley catheter use. Blood cultures have been negative to date.

5. Kidney Injury: The patient has an acute on chronic kidney injury since the renal transplant. Creatinine levels are now back to baseline between 2.0 and 2.8. Tacrolimus dosage has been adjusted to 3mg.

6. Hypereosinophilia: The"
