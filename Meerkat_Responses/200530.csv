","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) who presented with cough, abdominal pain, and hematuria. She has been diagnosed with LUL (left upper lobe) collapse, multiple abdominal metastases, and a new bladder mass. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter has been placed due to a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently being treated for hypotension, hypoxia, cough, abdominal pain, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure, which could be due to hypovolemia (blood loss or dehydration), sepsis, PE, or medication side effects such as morphine. The patient's condition seems to be resolving, but close monitoring is necessary.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and decreased oxygen levels. This could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, mechanical irritation from bulky lymphadenopathy, or a contribution from right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. Further investigation with a chest CT is needed to better characterize the lung pathology.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has pain in the abdomen, which could be attributed to multiple new omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage. The cause of hypotension is still being evaluated, with possible causes including hypovolemia (blood loss or dehydration), sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or medication side effects.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory difficulties, which may be due to a collapsed lung (LL collapse), resulting in decreased oxygen exchange. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs.

3. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine indicates a possible urinary tract issue, such as a bladder mass or infection. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications, including kidney damage.

4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body. Proper management is necessary to prevent worsening of the infection.

5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The elevated levels of bilirubin may indicate liver dysfunction or hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.

6. CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia): The patient has a history of CLL, and recent findings suggest progression of the disease. Monitoring and treatment for CLL are important to manage symptoms and prevent complications.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CLL presenting with cough, abdominal pain, and hematuria. She has been diagnosed with lung and abdominal metastases, as well as a new bladder mass. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing hypoxia and hypotension. Her lab results show leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and elevated uric acid levels. The patient has a history of asthma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension could be indicative of an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure if oxygenation cannot be maintained.
3. Bleeding: The patient's hematuria and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with procedures like Foley catheter placement or biopsies.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and uric acid levels, along with potential dehydration or hypotension, may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia could be due to liver involvement by metastatic disease or hemolysis.
6. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's hypotension and history of hypertension could result in cardiovascular collapse if not properly"

          # PE--stable from hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint and
   feel is high risk for anticoagulation given extensive bladder mass and
   hematuria w/ recent h/h drop
           Had IVC filter placed yesterday and remains on dvt prophy with
   sc heparin
           Echo to assess RV fx
          #? post-obstructive pna--f/u ct chest (noncontrast) to further
   asses lung involvement and evaluate LLL, though without contrast
   evaluation of mediastinal LN is limited, also most likely from CLL, may
   identify bx-able lesion, though again if concern for transformation of
   CLL fna less helpful at making dx
          continue empiric antbx with levo flagyl, broadening coverage if
   worsening respiratory or clinical status
       # Cough
add tessalon perles, robitussion, flovent and consider
   codeine
   #CLL/malignancy

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with hematuria, transient hypotension, and abdominal pain. She has extensive masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis/bladder, suggesting widely metastatic disease with unclear primary. The main issues include transient hypotension, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism (PE), post-obstructive pneumonia, infection, anemia, uric acid elevation, liver function test abnormalities, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hematuria, hypertension, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transient hypotension: This could be due to medication effect from morphine, blood loss, PE, or sepsis/infection from urine. The patient has received a blood transfusion and is being monitored closely.
2. Hypoxia: This could be secondary to PE or medication effect from morphine. An IVC filter has been placed, and further assessment of right ventricular function is planned.
3. Infection: The patient is on empirical antibiotic coverage with Levo Flagyl. An infection workup is underway, and coverage may be broadened if respiratory or clinical status worsens.
4. Post-obstructive pneumonia: A follow-up CT chest will help assess lung involvement. The patient is currently stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
5. CLL/malignancy: The patient has widely metastatic cancer with an unclear primary site. T"

   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
   tract obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function with mild left
   ventricular outflow tract obstruction. No significant valvular
   disease.

   A/P:
   85F russian, CLL, presenting with cough, abd pain, and hematuria, found
   to have LUL collapse [**1-6**] LAD, multiple abdominal mets, and new bladder
   mass.
   .
   # hypotension - resolving, ddx includes hypovolemia (blood loss,
   dehydration) vs sepsis vs PE vs [**1-6**] morphine. ANC > 1000, thus atypical
   infxns unlikely.  feel more likely medication vs sepsis. BP stable
   presently, low 100s, mentating well, well perfused.
   - follow UOP, prn bolus for UOP <30cc/hr (EF >55%).
   - T&S.
   - serial HCT for today, q8h.
   - f/u bcx, ucx, consider sputum cx.
   - continue levo/flagyl for now, consider broadening for
   post-obstructive cvg only if looks ill.
   - LENIs to consider IVC filter, consider CTA, as would be useful to
   better characterize thoracic lymphadenopathy in terms best site for
   biopsy.
   - ?heparin, consider hold off on anticoag for now given stable
   respiratory status, and ?hemodynamically significant bleeding.
   - upon further discussion, and repeat HCT falling, will place IVC
   filter and hold off on  heparin for now.
   .
   .
   # hypoxia - +cough, new LLL collapse likely 2/2 L hilar lymphadenopathy
   with resulting post-obstructive colapse, +LLL effusion, ?RLL increased
   opacification, also ?contribution from RLL PE (?old), not completely
   characterized on CT ABD/PELVIS. no EKG changes concerning for MI, no
   evidence of CHF.  currently on 2L O2, breathing comfortably.
   - CTA to characterize PE, also to characterize thoracic lymphadenoapthy
   and metastasis with regard to potential biopsy sites.
   - continue levo/flagyl, broaden if looks ill.
   - consider heparin gtt after CTA, hematuria stable presently

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old Russian female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presenting with cough, abdominal pain, and hematuria. The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities including hypertension, asthma, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and glucose intolerance.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, which is resolving, with a differential diagnosis including hypovolemia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and medication side effects. The patient's blood count is elevated at 1000, making atypical infections unlikely. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is well perfused.

The patient also has hypoxia, which is attributed to new left lower lobe collapse due to post-obstructive atelectasis caused by hilar lymphadenopathy. There is also a possibility of a right lower lobe PE, although it is not completely characterized on the CT abdomen/peelvis.

Additionally, the patient has abdominal pain due to multiple new omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal metastases, as well as a mass in the greater curvature of the junction and a mass in the left upper quadrant. The primary site of the malignancy is unclear, with possibilities including bladder or ovarian cancer. There is also increased splenomegaly.

The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to CLL or"

   8.  Known pulmonary embolism not visualized given the lack of contrast
   administration. The extent of pulmonary emboli, accordingly, cannot be
   assessed.
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
   tract obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function with mild left
   ventricular outflow tract obstruction. No significant valvular
   disease.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, hypoxia, abdominal pain, and hematuria. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to hypotension and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, and the recent CT scan shows marked left axillary lymphadenopathy, amenable to biopsy, which could indicate a potential source of PE.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by hypotension and dehydration.
4. Hemolysis: The elevated bilirubin levels and absence of biliary dilation on CT raise the possibility of hemolysis, possibly secondary to CLL or an underlying malignancy.
5. Malignancy: The presence of multiple abdominal masses, left infrahilar mass with post-obstructive atelectasis, and new bladder mass suggest a possible underlying malignancy.
6. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate potential liver dysfunction, which could be related to metastasis or infection.
