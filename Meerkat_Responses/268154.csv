","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of multiple medical issues. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension, lethargy, and diarrhea. She has a central venous port in place, and her vital signs are within normal limits except for low blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate volume depletion or extrasvascular loss. The cause of hypotension is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes include urosepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or dehydration from diarrhea.

2. Lethargy: The patient's mental status is improving with hydration, suggesting that her lethargy may be multifactorial. Factors contributing to her lethargy include medications, hypotension, and possible infection. Avoiding sedating medications and ensuring adequate hydration are important in managing her mental status.

3. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient has a hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to IV fluids. Changing the IV fluids to lactated Ringer's solution and transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) are recommended.

4. Breast Cancer: The patient has a history of breast cancer, and further care should be coordinated with the primary oncologist.

5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea needs further evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for lethargy and hypotension. She has been intermittently hypotensive despite receiving intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/48 to 114/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring indicates a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg. The patient has received various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, pantoprazole, and phenobarbital. She also has a history of diarrhea, for which stool cultures have been ordered. The patient's abdominal examination reveals ecchymoses, and her neurological examination shows slow responses. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The chest X-ray suggests no acute airspace process but does show diffusely prominent interstitial markings with a wide differential diagnosis. The patient's assessment includes hypotension possibly due to urinary tract infection, lethargy likely caused by medications, hypotension, and infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who is currently in the ICU. She was found hypotensive and minimally responsive this morning. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, leading to dehydration over the past few days. She is also immunocompromised due to a recent hospital stay. The potential sources of infection include the urinary tract, bowel, and portacath. The patient has been given fluids, but her blood pressure is still trending off, raising concerns about adrenal insufficiency. Other issues include altered mental status, non-gap acidosis with chloride resuscitation, electrolyte imbalances (calcium and magnesium), renal angle pain, anticoagulation, and breast cancer management. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Early sepsis with sources being urine and bowel, compounded by dehydration due to diarrhea.
2. Adrenal insufficiency.
3. Hypotension and altered mental status, possibly due to medication effects or hypotension.
4. Non-gap acidosis with chloride resuscitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presented to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with early sepsis, likely due to urinary and bowel sources, and dehydration. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized after receiving fluids, but there are concerns about adrenal insufficiency. She is currently being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl) and her vital signs are being closely monitored. The patient also has non-gap metabolic acidosis with chloride resuscitation, electrolyte imbalances (hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, and a history of cardiomyopathy.

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a concern for adrenal insufficiency. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to hypotension, medication effects, or other underlying causes. Close observation and further evaluation, such as a lumbar puncture if indicated, are required.
3. Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis with Chloride Resuscitation: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, which needs to be addressed and managed appropriately. Switching to lactated Ringer's solution may help in correcting the acid-base imbalance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and recent craniectomy, currently in the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with early sepsis with potential sources including urine, bowel, and portacath. The patient is relatively immunocompromised due to a recent hospital stay. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/50 mmHg to 114/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,286 mL and total output of 535 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, low creatinine, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction and potential septic shock.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including urinary tract infection, bowel infection, and possible catheter-related bloodstream infection. These infections could lead to worsening sepsis and systemic complications.
3. Dehydration: The patient has been dehydrated over the past few days due to diarrhea, which increases the risk of kidney injury and other complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presenting with hypotension, lethargy, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She has been experiencing diarrhea and has shown signs of sepsis, as indicated by her mixed venous O2 saturation of 85 and elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient's blood pressure has been maintained at goal with intravenous fluid boluses.
- She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for fevers in the setting of relative neutropenia.
- The patient's mental status is improving with hydration, and she is responsive to IVF boluses.
- Her echocardiogram shows normal findings with an ejection fraction of 60-70%, suggesting she is hyperdynamic, consistent with sepsis.
- Other findings include hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to IV fluids, and a negative C. diff test.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. It is essential to monitor her blood pressure closely and administer appropriate IV fluids or vasopressors if needed.
2. UTI: The patient has a confirmed UTI, and there is a risk of worsening infection or developing sepsis if not appropriately managed with antibiotics.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's clinical presentation"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of breast cancer. She is currently in the ICU for hypotension and lethargy. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 103/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's physical examination shows that she appears well-nourished, with clear breath sounds and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination reveals that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is 85%. Imaging studies reveal an ejection fraction of 60-70% on echocardiogram.

The patient's medical history includes breast cancer, which may be associated with her current symptoms of hypotension and lethargy. Her current medications include Compazine, Keppra, Fexofenadine, Ecitalopram, Phenobarbital, PPI, ASA, and Ipratropium nebs.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently experiencing hypotension, lethargy, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is in the ICU and has been receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for her condition.

24-hour events:
- The patient's blood pressure remained stable overnight.
- A stimulation test was performed, showing normal results.
- An echocardiogram was conducted, revealing normal findings with an ejection fraction of 60-70%, suggesting hyperdynamic function, which could be consistent with sepsis.
- Mixed venous O2 saturation level is at 85.
- Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test came back negative.
- The patient has been hypotensive at night, so sleeping aids were avoided.

Medications:
- Prochlorperazine maleate (Compazine) - unknown dose
- Vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole - last doses administered on [**2189-4-23**], [**2189-4-24**], and [**2189-4-24**], respectively.
- Other ICU medications include ipratropium nebs, keppra, fexofenadine, ecitalopram, phenobarbital, PPI, ASA, and others.

Infusions:
- No specific infusions mentioned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who was found hypotensive and minimally responsive in the morning. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's initial differential diagnosis included early sepsis with potential sources being urine and bowel, compounded by dehydration over the past few days due to diarrhea. The patient is relatively immunocompromised with a recent hospital stay, and potential sources of infection include urine, stools, and a portacath. Clostridium difficile (C diff) has been ruled out. The likely source of infection seems to be a urinary tract infection (UTI), so vancomycin and Flagyl have been discontinued, while cefepime has been continued while awaiting final urine culture results. The patient's altered mental status has improved with time and MAPs. She also has non-gap metabolic acidosis with chloride resuscitation, and her calcium and magnesium levels have been repleted. The patient's pain management regimen has been restarted, and she will be restarted on plaquenil and celebrex. Anticoagulation with coumadin will be restarted at home dose. The patient's breast cancer treatment should be coordinated with an oncologist. The patient's nutritional intake will be maintained through a po diet, and glycemic control will be monitored. The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath), and she is on prophylaxis for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer who was found hypotensive and minimally responsive this morning. She had been at a rehabilitation facility after undergoing a craniectomy. The patient's vitals show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/72 mmHg to 134/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination revealed chronically ill appearance, bilateral rales more prominent on the right, soft abdomen, 2+ edema, ecchymoses, and slowed speech but oriented x3. 

The patient's labs indicate a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 254 K/uL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 86 mg/dL to 160 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated lactate level of 20 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and decreased albumin level. 

The assessment and plan include resolving hypotension, improved altered mental status with time, non-gap metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, restarting certain medications, and considering the patient's breast cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 54-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presented with lethargy and hypotension. She was found to have a positive C. diff stool test and was started on a 14-day course of Flagyl. Her vital signs were stable with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 93/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She was mildly tachycardic and had crackles in her bilateral anterior chest. Her abdominal examination revealed a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. She had a distended, softly distended abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 27.3 g/dL, platelet count of 81 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 81 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.6. Her electrolytes were within normal limits.

Radiology findings included worsening right lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, as well as multiple metastatic lesions involving bones.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia secondary to several days of diarrhea and a urinary tract infection. The differential includes urosepsis. She is responsive to IV fluid"

   # Hypotension: This occured in the setting of several days of diarrhea,
   and a UTI, so our differential includes hypovolemia and urosepsis.  Her
   [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test was wnl, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely.  She is
   responsive to IVF boluses, and has maintained her goal MAP of >65 and
   goal UOP of >30cc/hr over the last 24 hours.
   - currently on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for fevers.  Can likely switch abx
   to ciprofloxacin for UTI as we have a clear source
   - Follow up pan culture
   - Transfuse with PRBC
s for hypotension as may hold volume more
   effectively given low albumin.
   .
   #Lethargy: Likely multifactorial [**1-17**] meds, hypotension, infection.
   Mental status improving with hydration.
   - Avoid sedating meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who is currently in the ICU. She presents with symptoms of lethargy, hypotension, and diarrhea. Her vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. She has been treated with antibiotics for fevers, but continues to have positive C. diff stool cultures. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows worsening right lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, as well as multiple metastatic lesions in the bones. The patient is responsive to IV fluid boluses and has maintained adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urine output (UOP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia, urosepsis, or other factors. It is important to continue IV fluid administration and consider transfusion with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to hold volume effectively.
2. Lethargy: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, influenced by medications, hypotension, and infection. Improving hydration has resulted in an improvement in mental status.
3. Acid Base Imbalance: The patient has hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may be related to IV fluids. Changing to lactated Ringer's (LR) solution can help correct this imbalance."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain and bone. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension and lethargy. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, and her blood pressure is fluid-responsive, suggesting possible hypovolemia. She has a positive test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with flagyl. The patient's lethargy has improved over time. Her metabolic acidosis is non-gap and likely due to chloride resuscitation. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels need to be repleted. She is also on medications for rheumatoid arthritis and has a history of a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) for which she is taking Coumadin. The patient's breast cancer is being managed by her primary oncologist, and she is also on phenobarbital and keppra for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases. There is some swelling in her right lower extremity, but no clot was found. The patient's nutritional status will be monitored, and she will be transitioned to a regular diet with a nutrition consult. She has a port-a-cath for medication administration and no peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs). She is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and breast cancer metastatic to the brain (s/p recent craniotomy) and bone. She was admitted from rehab after being found hypotensive and lethargic. The patient has a past medical history of RA, breast cancer, and is currently on plaquenil and celebrex. She also has a history of multiple comorbidities including recent craniotomy and bone metastasis.

24-hour events include an ultrasound that was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the patient's heart rate improved from 140s to 110s after receiving 20mg IV lasix due to suspected volume overload. The patient was started on flagyl for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and received antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime.

Physical examination revealed that the patient was not in acute distress, had normal heart sounds, crackles anteriorly (right more than left), diminished breath sounds at bases posteriorly bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities with 2+ edema bilaterally, multiple ecchymoses, and attentive neurologic status with slowed speech, oriented x3, and following simple commands.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 292 K/uL, elevated creatinine at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU for lethargy and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, persistent diarrhea, and sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/69 to 91/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is currently receiving intravenous fluids and antibiotics for C. diff and UTI. Her mental status has improved with hydration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Close monitoring and administration of IV fluids are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's UTI may have led to sepsis. It is important to continue antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. diff and is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics. Close monitoring for worsening symptoms and complications related to C. diff infection is essential.
4. Acid-base imbalance: The patient has a hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely caused by the IV fluids administered. Adjust"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer metastatic to the brain, and bone, admitted from rehab after being found hypotensive and lethargic. The patient has been treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and has received multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 96/69 mmHg, heart rate of 106 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis or hypovolemia. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to chloride resuscitation. Continuous monitoring of acid-base balance is important.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a prior cere"
