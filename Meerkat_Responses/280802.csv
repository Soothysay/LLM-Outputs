","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. The patient remains on high-flow oxygen and is being treated for pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, refractory CLL, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is progression of the infectious process or volume overload.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may not respond to current antibiotic and antifungal treatments, leading to worsening of symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to increased bleeding risks, requiring frequent platelet transfusions.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's persistent neutropenia puts her at risk for infections, which may require continued use of neutropenic precautions and neupogen injections.
5. Anemia: The drop in hemoglobin levels may indicate hemolysis or ongoing blood loss, requiring further evaluation and potential transfusion.
6. Refractory CLL: The patient's CLL may continue to progress despite previous treatments, necessitating alternative therapeutic options.
7. GERD:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remains asymptomatic and has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/71 to 122/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for pneumonia and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is already diagnosed with pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and systemic infection.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of infection or delayed wound healing.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of up to 850 mL over the past 24 hours. This indicates that the patient may be losing fluids, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, particularly when compared to the upper range of 122/75 mmHg. Hypotension can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated at 6.0 K/uL. This may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and previous hospitalization for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been transferred to the ICU with pneumonia and other medical complications.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on high flow oxygen and is being treated for an infectious process with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Volume overload is also a concern.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has pneumonia and potential skin integrity issues.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet transfusions.

4. Neutropenia: The patient has persistent neutropenia requiring multiple neupagen injections.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped, and there is a history of AIHA. DIC/hemolysis labs should be performed, and transfusion should be discussed with the hematology department.

6. Refractory CLL: The patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her disease. Treatment for CLL is currently on hold due to pulmonary processes and infection.

7. GERD: The patient is to continue taking home omeprazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of infection, further decline in platelet and neutrophil counts, worsening anemia, and potential relapse of CLL.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57F CLL s/p BMT / relapse admitted with
   respiratory distress / hypoxemia in the setting of viral / fungal /
   polymicrobial pneumonia. Unable to wean oxygen, clinically stable
   otherwise. Echo normal.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2 BP 112/60 HR 107 RR 22 with sat 99 on 0.5
   HFFM. WD woman, NAD. Dry crackles, [**Month (only) **] at bases. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 32, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.4.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with therapy directed at
   viral / fungal / bacterial pneumonia with ambisome, bactrim, vanco, and
   cefepime s/p pavilizumab, as well as diuresis for component of volume
   overload; will try to wean oxygen. Will check LENIs to r/o PE, though
   this seems unlikely. Once LENIs complete, will mobilize OOB and ADAT.
   Will f/u all cx results to target abx therapy, ID following. BMT - off
   immunosupression, continue GVH rx with PO budesonide, pentamidine and
   acyclovir
 care d/w BMT attending directly. For neutropenia - continue
   GCSF; for thrombocytopenia - transfuse if <10 or bleeding. Will assess
   for PICC given poor access and need for IV abx. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

An echocardiogram showed no evidence of right heart strain, and further evaluation with a LENIs (likely referring to a lower extremity ultrasound) is planned.

The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics (Ambisome, bactrim, vancomycin, and cefepime) for her pneumonia, as well as inhaled bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium nebs). Blood and BAL cultures have been sent for further evaluation. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia, which require close monitoring and potential transfusions or injections to stimulate blood cell production.

The patient has a history of refractory CLL and has undergone an allo-sCT (allogeneic stem cell transplant) with a relapse of her disease. Her treatment for CLL is currently on hold due to the pulmonary processes and infection. She is also on medications for prophylaxis against GVHD (gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease) and CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57F CLL s/p BMT / relapse admitted with
   respiratory distress / hypoxemia in the setting of viral / fungal /
   polymicrobial pneumonia. Unable to wean oxygen, clinically stable
   otherwise. Echo normal.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2 BP 112/60 HR 107 RR 22 with sat 99 on 0.5
   HFFM. WD woman, NAD. Dry crackles, [**Month (only) **] at bases. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 32, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.4.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with therapy directed at
   viral / fungal / bacterial pneumonia with ambisome, bactrim, vanco, and
   cefepime s/p pavilizumab, as well as diuresis for component of volume
   overload; will try to wean oxygen. Will check LENIs to r/o PE, though
   this seems unlikely. Once LENIs complete, will mobilize OOB and ADAT.
   Will f/u all cx results to target abx therapy, ID following. BMT - off
   immunosupression, continue GVH rx with PO budesonide, pentamidine and
   acyclovir
 care d/w BMT attending directly. For neutropenia - continue
   GCSF; for thrombocytopenia - transfuse if <10 or bleeding. Will assess
   for PICC given poor access and need for IV abx. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and fungal pneumonia who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with progressive infectious process and volume overload. Although there has been some improvement, the patient still requires respiratory support. There is concern for an embolic event due to her active malignancy and persistent hypoxia. The initial concern was pneumonia, but further evaluation with LENIs (likely referring to a lung imaging test) is needed to rule out pulmonary embolism.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This condition requires frequent platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding complications.

3. Neutropenia: The patient also has persistent neutropenia, which is a low neutrophil count. This increases the risk of infection and requires multiple neupogen injections to stimulate the production of neutrophils.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, but it is managed with a blood transfusion. No evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was found.

5. Refractory CLL: The patient has relapsed CLL, and further treatment is on hold due to the current pulmonary processes and infection."

   respiratory distress / hypoxemia in the setting of viral / fungal /
   polymicrobial pneumonia. Unable to wean oxygen, clinically stable
   otherwise. Echo normal.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2 BP 112/60 HR 107 RR 22 with sat 99 on 0.5
   HFFM. WD woman, NAD. Dry crackles, [**Month (only) **] at bases. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 32, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.4.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with therapy directed at
   viral / fungal / bacterial pneumonia with ambisome, bactrim, vanco, and
   cefepime s/p pavilizumab, as well as diuresis for component of volume
   overload; will try to wean oxygen. Will check LENIs to r/o PE, though
   this seems unlikely. Once LENIs complete, will mobilize OOB and ADAT.
   Will f/u all cx results to target abx therapy, ID following. BMT - off
   immunosupression, continue GVH rx with PO budesonide, pentamidine and
   acyclovir
 care d/w BMT attending directly. For neutropenia - continue
   GCSF; for thrombocytopenia - transfuse if <10 or bleeding. Will assess
   for PICC given poor access and need for IV abx. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

- Blood pressure: 103/66 mmHg
- Heart rate: 92 bpm
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on 0.5 L of oxygen

The patient's physical examination reveals dry crackles at the lung bases and a regular rate and rhythm. 

Laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 7.0 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 32%
- Platelet count: 39 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
- Glucose: 104 mg/dL

Imaging studies show multifocal opacities in the right lung field, suggestive of pneumonia.

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to persistent hypoxia.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and requires frequent platelet transfusions.

   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: progressive infectious process w/
   element of volume overload.  In a patient with active malignancy and
   persistant hypoxia, embolic event is concerning. LENI
s negative and
   echo negative for R-sided strain, therefore low likelihood for PE
   although not ruled out. However, if CTA confirms PE, would not alter
   management in this severely thrombocytopenic patient.  Will add
   azithromycin as she is not improving and not covered for atypicals.
   While she is not covered for anearobic coverage, she has not had
   witness aspiration episodes and does not have poor dentition. Pt not
   better and BMT hesitant to stop vancomycin. Will intensify diuresis
   dosing.
   - Add azithromycin 500mg PO Q24H
   - continue Ambisome, bactrim, Vancomycin and cefepime
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - follow up final blood cx and BAL cx
   - lasix 20mg IV x1
   - Wean to nasal cannula
   #. Thrombocytopenia: patient with persistent thrombocytopenia [**2-21**] chemo
   requiring frequent platelet transfusions
   --continue to monitor, transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   #) Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring multiple

   - continue neupogen
   #) Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs. s/p 1 upRBC
   #) Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Further treatment on hold given pulmonary processes and infection
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and previously admitted to Hospital 13192 for hypoxic respiratory failure. She was transferred to Hospital Unit 1 due to the hypoxic respiratory failure and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and impaired skin integrity. The pneumonia is caused by an infectious process with elements of volume overload. The impaired skin integrity is likely due to her prolonged stay in the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, refractory CLL, and GERD. The hypoxic respiratory failure is a progressive infectious process with elements of volume overload. The thrombocytopenia is likely due to her ongoing chemotherapy treatment for CLL. The neutropenia is also a result of the chemotherapy. The anemia is stable and not associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The refractory CLL indicates that her CLL is not responding to previous treatments, including allo stem cell transplantation. The GERD is being managed with home omeprazole.

The patient's current medications include ambisome, bactrim, vancomycin, cefepime, albuterol, ipratropium nebs, azithromycin, lasix,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), fungal, polymicrobial, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) pneumonia, currently experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a history of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, refractory CLL, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), and prior allo SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation). The patient's medical and family history, social history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, administration of IV lasix, and discontinuation of vancomycin and acyclovir. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, bactrim, and Ambisome. Other medications include folate, budesonide, acyclovir, omeprazole, magnesium oxide, filgastrim, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, and ipratropium nebs.

Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated CRP, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profiles. Imaging studies reveal worsening aeration in the left lung field, possible layering effusion, and slightly improved right-sided diffuse opacities.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who is currently experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with fungal, polymicrobial, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, administration of medications such as vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftazidime, and bactrim, and the transfusion of platelets and red blood cells.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/66 mmHg to 130/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on face tent with 50% oxygen. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 149 mg/dL. The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 10.0 g/dL, while her white blood cell count is within normal range at 6.0 K/uL. Her platelet count is critically low at 39 K/uL, indicating thrombocytopenia. Other lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as decreased levels of albumin and calcium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal, polymicrobial, and RSV PNA, now experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, which causes pruritus. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including cefepime, bactrim, Ambisome, filgastrim, and lasix. 

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, receiving 10 mg of IV lasix, and ID recommending stopping vancomycin and acyclovir. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/66 to 130/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The physical examination reveals diffuse inspiratory rales posteriorly with bronchial breath sounds and focal expiratory wheeze over the left lower lobe. The patient has warm extremities and 1+ lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 39 K/uL, blood glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated D-dimer, fibrin"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who is currently experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has multiple infections, including fungal, polymicrobial, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and pruritus. She has been receiving various medications such as vancomycin, acyclovir, cefepime, and bactrim.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/66 mmHg to 130/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

Her laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 27.4 g/dL, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate elevated D-dimer levels and low fibrinogen levels. Imaging studies reveal worsening aeration of the left lung field and a possible layering effusion, as well as slightly improved right-sided diffuse opacities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal, polymicrobial, and RSV PNA, currently experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a history of refractory CLL and has undergone an allo SCT with relapse of her disease. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and GERD. She has been treated with various medications including Ambisome, bactrim, vancomycin, cefepime, albuterol, ipratropium nebs, lasix, omeprazole, neupogen, and upRBC transfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to the ongoing infectious process and volume overload.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to increased bleeding risk, especially if it drops below 10,000/mm3.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's persistent neutropenia increases the risk of infection and could require further interventions.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may continue to be stable, but monitoring and potential transfusions may be necessary.
5. Refractory CLL: The patient's CLL may not respond to current treatments, and alternative options may need to be explored.
6. GERD: The patient's GERD symptoms may persist, and adjustments to her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal, polymicrobial, and RSV PNA, now presenting with persistent hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antiviral medications, including vancomycin, acyclovir, cefepime, and bactrim. She also has thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, refractory CLL, and GERD. The patient's condition has been worsening despite treatment, with increased shortness of breath and worsening oxygen saturation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxic respiratory failure is a significant concern. If not managed appropriately, it could lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state from CLL and ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive medications. Any new or worsening infection could exacerbate her respiratory failure and require additional interventions.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially with procedures or if there is any trauma. Close monitoring and appropriate platelet transfusions will be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia puts her at increased risk for infections. Strict adherence to neutropenic precautions and continued administration of neupogen are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and hypoxic respiratory failure who was transferred to the ICU. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypoxemia, pneumonia, pancytopenia, leukemia, impaired skin integrity, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, refractory CLL, GERD, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of further infection and complications.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, anemia, and bleeding.
4. Leukemia: The relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) indicates a risk of progression or transformation to a more aggressive form of leukemia.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The ecchymosis and scleral hemorrhage suggest potential bleeding disorders or coagulopathy.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially with frequent platelet transfusions.
7. Neutropenia: The persistent low neutrophil count puts the patient at high risk for infections.
8. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. The patient experienced episodes of desaturation in the high 80s and low 90s, which were resolved by increasing the face shield FiO2 from 50 to 80% and then weaning back down. The patient also felt anxious and was given Ativan to resolve the anxiety. The chest X-ray looked unchanged, but the patient felt worse, so azithromycin was added to cover atypical organisms. The patient had another desat episode in the mid-80s on 50% FiO2 face shield, which increased to 80% and still remained in the high 80s-low 90s. The patient's allergies are obtained from [**Hospital 15**] Medical records. The patient received multiple antibiotics, including Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Ambisome, Cefipime, and Bactrim. The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 to 133/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in blood pressure. The patient has received blood products and has a total fluid balance of 3,653 mL in, 3,475 mL out, with a urine output of 3,475 mL. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support, with an ABG result of 28 mmHg. Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's condition. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. The patient has impaired skin integrity, hypoxemia, pneumonia (other), pancytopenia, and chronic leukemia. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU. Prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP are also being taken."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who is currently admitted to the ICU. She has been diagnosed with fungal, polymicrobial, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to a progressive infectious process with volume overload. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of right heart strain, and a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) was negative for clot.

The patient's current treatment includes continuing ambisome (antifungal medication), bactrim (antibiotic), vancomycin (antibiotic), and cefepime (antibiotic). Repeat chest X-ray is recommended today, and consideration for a repeat chest CT to assess for pleural effusion should be made. Diuretics (lasix) will be administered to address volume overload. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium will continue to be used for respiratory support. Blood cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures will be repeated for further evaluation.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which requires frequent platelet transfusions. Neutropenia is present and the patient is on neupogen injections. Anemia is stable, and the patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells. Refractory CLL has been identified"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She is experiencing persistent hypoxia despite receiving respiratory support, and there is suspicion of an ongoing infectious process. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and refractory CLL. She has undergone allo stem cell transplantation in the past, but her disease has relapsed. Treatment for her CLL is currently on hold due to pulmonary processes and infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia indicates a possible complication of her underlying respiratory condition. It is crucial to continue providing respiratory support and investigate any potential infectious causes contributing to her respiratory failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts her at risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and platelet transfusions when necessary are recommended to prevent bleeding events.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count makes her more susceptible to infections. Neupogen injections should be continued to stimulate the production of neutrophils, and strict neutropenic precautions should be maintained to prevent infection.
4. Anemia: Although the patient's anemia is currently stable, regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels is essential. Red blood cell transfusions may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity."

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia (PNA) and hypoxia. The patient's condition has not improved significantly since admission. The patient is experiencing ongoing desaturation, tachycardia, and negative fluid balance. Medical recommendations have been made to discontinue acyclovir, vancomycin, azithromycin, and consider holding cefepime. The patient's allergies include morphine and pruritis. Antibiotics were administered at various times. The patient is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including furosemide. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals crackles and wheezing in the lungs, purpura on the skin, and non-purposeful movement. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of chronic leukemia and impaired skin integrity. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing desaturation and hypoxia indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Pneumonia and the presence of purpura on the skin may suggest a risk of infection.
3. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Organ dysfunction: Impaired skin"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA and [**Hospital 13192**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypoxic respiratory failure
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Not improving despite broad coverage. Her hypoxia is likely [**2-21**] shunt
   from large portions of consolidated lung. ID recommends stopping vanc,
   azithro and considering stopping cefepime as she has known pathogens,
   repeat additional cultures negative and while she is neutropenic, she
   is not febrile.  They recommended continuing bactrim and ambisome.
   Continued concern for embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo
   negative for R-sided strain, and severely thrombocytopenic.
   - stopped vanc and azithro
   - bactrim switched to PO to reduce volume
   - continue Ambisome, cefepime
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   2. Tachycardia
   Sinus tachycardia is most likely [**2-21**] hypoxia.
   When oxygen sat (black line) is up, heart rate (red line) is down:
   [image004.gif]
   And spikes in heart rate correspond to drops in sats
   [image006.gif]
   -- she is asymptomatic so it is okay to not treat this sinus
   tachycardia
   -- could consider fluid challenge to see if it responds to a small
   bolus as there may be also an element of hypovolemia
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: patient with persistent thrombocytopenia [**2-21**]
   chemo requiring frequent platelet transfusions. Platelets 10 this am.
   -- check pm CBC and transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   4. Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   5. Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   6. Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Does not desire further treatment
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD,
   - holding acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk
   7. GERD: Continue home omeprazole

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA and [**Hospital 13192**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypoxic respiratory failure
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Not  improving despite broad coverage. Her hypoxia is likely [**2-21**] shunt
   from large portions of lung with consolidation and not ventilated. She
   has a severe RSV pneumonia with c/b immunodeficiency. She may not
   improve on antibiotics. ID recommends stopping vanc, azitro and
   acyclovir and considering stopping cefepime as she has known pathogen,
   repeat additional cultures negative and while she is neutropenic, she
   is not febrile.  They recommended continuing bactrim and ambisome.
   Continued concern for embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo
   negative for R-sided strain,and severely thrombocytopenic.
   - continue Ambisome, bactrim, Vancomycin and cefepime and azithro
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - follow up final blood cx and BAL cx
   - Wean as tolerated
   2. Tachycardia
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: patient with persistent thrombocytopenia [**2-21**]
   chemo requiring frequent platelet transfusions
   --continue to monitor, transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   #) Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring multiple
   neupagen injections
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   #) Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   #) Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Further treatment on hold given pulmonary processes and infection
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD,
   - hold acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk
   #) GERD: Continue home omeprazole

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and a previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT). She was transferred to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe respiratory distress due to severe RSV pneumonia with compromised lung function. This condition is likely to worsen without appropriate treatment and may result in further respiratory failure.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet transfusions. This could increase the risk of bleeding complications.

3. Neutropenia: The patient has persistent neutropenia requiring multiple neupogen injections. Neutropenic precautions should be continued, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of infection.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia but with negative disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and consider packed red blood cell transfusions if necessary.

5. Refractory CLL: The patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her disease. Further treatment for CLL is on hold due to the current pulmonary processes and infection.

6. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple comorbidities. She is currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and presents with polymicrobial, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and likely fungal pneumonia. She also has persistent hypoxic respiratory failure, which has not improved despite attempts at diuresis. The patient is neutropenic and requires frequent platelet transfusions. Her platelet count is low, and she has stable anemia. She is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which is likely in response to hypoxemia. She also has refractory CLL and a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with relapse of her disease. The patient's current medications include ambisome, bactrim, cefepime, albuterol, ipratropium nebs, omeprazole, and neupogen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxic respiratory failure requires further evaluation and management. The cause could be due to an infectious process or volume overload, but the patient appears euvolemic on examination. This may require additional interventions such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count requires close monitoring and appropriate management. Platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, polymicrobial infection, RSV, and likely fungal pneumonia. She is experiencing persistent hypoxic respiratory failure despite attempts at diuresis. Her thrombocytopenia and neutropenia require close monitoring and treatment. She also has stable anemia, sinus tachycardia, refractory CLL, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxic respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration of her oxygenation and potentially progress to respiratory arrest.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially if her platelet transfusion criteria are not met.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's compromised immune system due to neutropenia makes her more susceptible to infections and delays wound healing.
4. Anemia: The patient's stable anemia should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to prevent further deterioration.
5. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's rapid heart rate may indicate underlying stress or infection and should be managed accordingly.
6. Refractory CLL: The patient's relapsed CLL may continue to progress despite previous treatments, leading to further complications and reduced quality of life.
7. GERD: The patient's GERD symptoms should be managed to prevent complications such as aspiration pneumonia or esophagitis."

   likely [**2-21**] persistent infectious process, previously thought also with
   a component of volume overload, but has appeared euvolemic on exam for
   the last two days and oxygenation has not improved with attempts at
   diuresis.  TTE with no evidence of RH strain, LENIs neg for clot.   ID
   recommended stopping vanco, but continued given lack of clinical
   improvement and persistent neutropenia.
   - continue Ambisome, bactrim, cefepime
   - d/c vanco and azithro
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - resend sputum culture
   - TBB even
   2. Thrombocytopenia:
   patient with persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet
   transfusions. No signs of active bleeding.
   - continue to monitor, check PM CBC and transfuse for platelets<10 or
   signs of bleeding
   3 Neutropenia:
   Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring multiple neupogen
   injections.
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   4. Anemia:
   Stable x several days, w/ neg DIC labs. s/p 1 upRBC
   - daily Hcts
   5. Tachycardia: sinus tach, HRs increase in response to hypoxemia.
   Denies CP or palpitations.
   - Rx of hypoxemic resp distress/insufficiency as above
   6.  Refractory CLL:
   Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her disease, most
   recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**]. Further
   treatment on hold given pulmonary processes and infection
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD, d/c acyclovir as recommended by ID
   6. GERD:
   Continue home omeprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who is currently experiencing hypoxia and respiratory failure. She has a polymicrobial infection, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and likely fungal pneumonia. The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, sinus tachycardia, and refractory CLL. She also has a history of gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying infectious process is not effectively treated or if there are further complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to bleeding complications if it further decreases or if she experiences any trauma or invasive procedures.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's severely low white blood cell count makes her susceptible to infections. It is crucial to continue neutropenic precautions and administer Neupogen injections to stimulate the production of white blood cells.
4. Anemia: The patient's stable anemia requires close monitoring, especially if it worsens or if she experiences any bleeding episodes.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's increased heart rate in response to hypoxemia may progress to more severe cardiac issues if her respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

   57 year old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA and [**Hospital 13192**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypoxic respiratory failure.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worsening respiratory failure, now on
   100% nonrebreather and still satting in mid 80s and looking fatigued.
   Likely due to accelerating worsening RSV or any other of the multiple
   organisms. Currently covered with cefepime, bactrim and ambisome.
   Continued concern for embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo
   negative for R-sided strain, and severely thrombocytopenic.  She has
   had little improvement w/ diuresis suggesting volume overload less
   likely contributing to her clinical picture, therefore will likely hold
   on further diuresis.
   - ABG
   - Intubation today.
   - Probable bronch, if so, will send BAL for gram stain, and culture
   - Fentanyl and midazolam for sedation
   - Consider another dose of antibody to tx RSV, will d/w ID
   - Continue ambisome (for fungal infection), bactrim (for
   stenotrophomonas), and cefepime empirically
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Consider a-line
   2. Tachycardia: Patient remains with sinus tachycardia likely [**2-21**]
   hypoxia.  Also with element of anxiety.
   - Treat respiratory failure as outlined
   - Ativan prn
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: 8 last night, s/p transfusion. Persistent
   thrombocytopenia [**2-21**] chemo requiring frequent platelet transfusions.
   Pts 27 s/p transfusion.
   - Follow and transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   4. Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   5. Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   6. Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Does not desire further treatment
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD, which is theoretically not
   systemically absorbed
   - holding acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and other comorbidities. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently on 100% nonrebreather and still saturating in the mid-80s, indicating persistent hypoxemia. She is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to hypoxia and anxiety. The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 8, which has been treated with platelet transfusion. She also has neutropenia and anemia but does not have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a history of refractory CLL and has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) with relapse of her disease. The patient does not desire further treatment for her CLL. She also has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is on home omeprazole. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory failure, despite being on 100% nonrebreather, is concerning. She is likely experiencing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or pneumonia caused by organisms such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, or other pathogens.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently being treated with ambisome (for fungal infection), bactrim (for stenotrophomonas), and cefepime empirically. The patient continues to be hypoxic with shunt physiology, likely secondary to consolidated lung.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a consolidated lung, which suggests pneumonia. If not effectively treated, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and shunt physiology indicate the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition that can cause low oxygen levels in the blood and may require mechanical ventilation.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is thrombocytopenic, meaning she has a low platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. Platelet transfusions have been given, but careful monitoring is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

4. Neutropenia: The patient also has neutropenia, which is a low white blood cell count. This increases the risk of infections. Neutropenic precautions are being followed, but close monitoring for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on 100% nonrebreather due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including pancytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and refractory CLL. She is also experiencing tachycardia, anxiety, and potential complications such as embolic events and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening despite being on 100% nonrebreather. There is a concern for accelerating worsening respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or other organisms. Current coverage with cefepime, bactrim, and ambisome may not be effective, and further interventions may be necessary.
2. Tachycardia: The patient remains with sinus tachycardia likely secondary to hypoxia and anxiety. Treating respiratory failure and addressing anxiety should help alleviate the tachycardia.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet transfusions. Close monitoring and transfusion for platelets <10 or signs of bleeding are recommended.
4. Neutropenia: The patient has persistent neutropenia"

   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypoxic respiratory failure
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient continues to be hypoxic with
   shunt physiology, likely secondary to consolidated lung.  Currently
   covered with cefepime, bactrim and ambisome.  Continued concern for
   embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo negative for R-sided
   strain, and severely thrombocytopenic.  She has had little improvement
   w/ diuresis suggesting volume overload less likely contributing to her
   clinical picture.
   - Continue ambisome (for fungal infection), bactrim (for
   stenotrophomonas), and cefepime empirically
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   2. Tachycardia: Patient remains with sinus tachycardia likely [**2-21**]
   hypoxia.  Also with element of anxiety.
   - Treat respiratory failure as outlined
   - Ativan prn
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: Persistent thrombocytopenia [**2-21**] chemo requiring
   frequent platelet transfusions. Pts 27 s/p transfusion.
   - Follow and transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   4. Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   5. Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   6. Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Does not desire further treatment
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD,
   - holding acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk
   7. GERD: Continue home omeprazole

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and previous allogeneic stem cell transplant. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She continues to be hypoxic with shunt physiology, likely secondary to consolidated lung. She has been treated with cefepime, bactrim, and ambisome empirically. There is a concern for an embolic event, but it has been ruled out by a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) and echocardiogram negative for right-sided strain.

The patient remains tachycardic due to hypoxia and anxiety, and she is being treated with respiratory support and ativan as needed. She has persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet transfusions. Her neutropenia has been persistent as well, necessitating neutropenic precautions and continuation of neupogen. Her anemia is stable without evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's refractory CLL is noted, with a prior allo SCT and relapse of her disease. She has been treated with bendamustine and rituximab, but does not desire further treatment. She is also on budesonide for gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and her acyclovir prophylaxis has been held due to low risk.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has been experiencing hypoxia and tachycardia throughout the day, requiring increased FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation in the mid-80s. The patient's platelet count has been stable, but there was a transfusion given to increase the platelet count to 45. The patient also has an allergy to morphine and pruritis. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 136 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 109/62 to 122/71 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits at 19 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but her oxygen saturation is low at 93%. 

The patient's lab results indicate pancytopenia with low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium and magnesium, as well as elevated liver enzymes. The patient's kidney function is impaired with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. Other lab results show an elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen level, indicating a possible coagulopathy. 

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neuro"

   57 year old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA and [**Hospital 13192**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypoxic respiratory failure
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Not improving despite broad coverage. Her hypoxia is likely [**2-21**] shunt
   from large portions of consolidated lung. ID recommends stopping vanc,
   azithro and considering stopping cefepime as she has known pathogens,
   repeat additional cultures negative and while she is neutropenic, she
   is not febrile.  They recommended continuing bactrim and ambisome.
   Continued concern for embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo
   negative for R-sided strain, and severely thrombocytopenic.
   - stopped vanc and azithro
   - bactrim switched to PO to reduce volume
   - continue Ambisome, cefepime
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   2. Tachycardia
   Sinus tachycardia is most likely [**2-21**] hypoxia.
   -- she is asymptomatic so it is okay to not treat this sinus
   tachycardia
   -- could consider fluid challenge to see if it responds to a small
   bolus as there may be also an element of hypovolemia
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: patient with persistent thrombocytopenia [**2-21**]
   chemo requiring frequent platelet transfusions. Platelets 10 this am.
   -- check pm CBC and transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   4. Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   5. Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   6. Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Does not desire further treatment
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD,
   - holding acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk

1. The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and previously admitted to [Hospital 13192] with hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. She has not been improving despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Her hypoxia is likely due to shunt from large portions of consolidated lung. ID recommends stopping vancomycin, azithromycin, and considering stopping cefepime as she has known pathogens, repeating additional cultures negative, and while she is neutropenic, she is not febrile. They recommend continuing bactrim and ambisome.
3. The patient has a continued concern for an embolic event, although the LENI is negative, and the echo is negative for right-sided strain, and she is severely thrombocytopenic.
4. The patient's sinus tachycardia is most likely due to hypoxia. She is asymptomatic, so it is okay to not treat this sinus tachycardia. However, a fluid challenge could be considered to see if it responds to a small bolus as there may also be an element of hypovolemia.
5. The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia requiring frequent platelet transfusions. Platelets were checked in the morning, and she should be transfused for platelets <10 or signs of bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and polymicrobial pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and likely fungal pneumonia. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and requires increased oxygen. The patient's condition has not improved despite attempts at diuresis, and there is evidence of evolving disease consistent with diffuse alveolar damage/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on imaging. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation and ARDS-specific management.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to increased bleeding risk, particularly if invasive procedures are required.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be a response to respiratory distress or sepsis, and it could potentially progress to cardiac complications if not addressed.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's compromised immune system due to CLL treatment makes her susceptible to infections, which may require vigilant monitoring and prompt treatment.
5. Anemia: Although stable for several days, the patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed with appropriate transfusion support.
6. Refractory CLL: The patient's leukemia remains refractory to treatment, and further management options should be discussed with the oncology team.

Overall, the patient's critical condition"

   Addendum
   Met with pt
s family.  Family members do not agree with pt
s decision
   for intubation as feel pt would not want a prolonged course on vent.
   They feel her prognosis for recovery is grim and that comfort would be
   a more appropriate course.
   We discussed that pt was lucid and understood the option of
   transitioning toward aggressive comfort verses moving toward continued
   aggressive life supporting care w/ intubation and that she expressed
   understanding that she likely will not be able to wean from the
   ventilator and that she may decline further., Given pt
s expressed
   wished, at this time is seems quite premature to reverse her status.
   Family is in agreement that we continue current aggressive care for
   now.  We will update them regularly and reassess. Pt more tachycardic
   and hypotensive and likely will require vasopressor support.  If
   continued clinical decline, transitioning away from continued
   excalation would be resoanble and we will address this with family and
   onc team.  Oncology team also spoke with pt prior to intubation, with
   her family and has been updated as to her status and this family mtg.
   Additional crit care time spent in meeting and discussion 40 min
   Addendum
   Over course of the day pt with worsening hemodynamics.  Initially
   tachycardiac to 160s, ecg c/w  SVT.  No response to  vagal maneuvers or
   adenosine  Became increasingly hypotensive and getting aggressive
   IVFs.  On amio transiently
stopped in setting of worsening
   hypotension.  With fluids HR improved to ST in 110
s.  Placed on
   vasopressor support, with neo and levophed added.  Suspect she is very
   intravascularly dry, worsened by positive pressure and peep. We
   continue  to adjust vent settings for worsening resp acidosis despite
   stable to slightly improved oxygenation (now at peep 10, fio2 weaned to
   0.8).  She has significant dysynchrony on vent and we will try
   paralytic [**Doctor Last Name **] and increasing sedation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and experienced a relapse. She is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia due to viral RSV, fungal, and polymicrobial pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 133 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 99/61 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.2Â°C.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (azithromycin, vancomycin, cefepime), antifungal medication (Ambisome), and other ICU medications such as lorazepam. However, despite these interventions, the patient's condition has been declining.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's active issues include hypoxemia/respiratory distress, likely evolving into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is euvolemic on examination, and oxygenation has not improved with attempted diuresis. There is no evidence of right heart strain, no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory failure, as indicated by low oxygen saturation levels despite being on 100% FiO2. The need for invasive ventilation suggests a critical condition.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring the administration of multiple vasopressors such as norepinephrine and levophed. This indicates poor perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, ranging from the 160s to the low 100s. This could be due to hypoxia, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.

4. Pneumonia: The presence of worsening pulmonary opacities on chest X-rays suggests pneumonia. The patient's sputum gram stain did not reveal any organisms, but cultures are pending. 

5. Pancytopenia: The patient's laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, indicating a possible bone marrow suppression or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

6. Leukemia: The mention of chronic leukemia raises the possibility of an underlying hematological malignancy contributing to the patient's current condition.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin assessment is not documented, but the mention of fever and impaired skin integrity suggests possible pressure ulcers or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and fungal pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated on two pressors. The patient has a history of immunocompromised status due to chemotherapy treatment.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, ARDS: The patient's PaO2 / FiO2 ratio is 133, indicating severe hypoxemia. She is now intubated and on two pressors.

2. Worsening Polymicrobial Pulmonary Infection: The patient has a worsening polymicrobial pulmonary infection in the setting of immunocompromised status. Empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) have been started, along with treatment doses of bactrim for stenotrophomonas and ambisome for fungal infection.

3. Severe Septic Shock with Multi-Organ System Failure: The patient developed severe septic shock with multi-organ system failure after intubation, likely secondary to positive pressure support. This is likely due to a worsening pulmonary infection leading to sepsis.

4. Respiratory and Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22. This is likely due to sepsis versus renal failure.

5. Tachycardia: The patient had a sinus tachycardia"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs, oxygenation, and ventilation. The patient is on invasive ventilation and arterial lines. Fever is present. There is ongoing concern for pneumonia, as evidenced by worsening pulmonary opacities on chest X-ray and pending sputum and blood cultures. The patient has shown episodes of tachycardia, including a supraventricular tachycardia episode, and required treatment with adenosine and amiodarone. Hypotension has been managed with vasopressors. The patient has pancytopenia, with low platelet count and white blood cell count. Chronic leukemia is noted in the assessment. Impaired skin integrity is mentioned, but no further details are provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infections: The presence of an arterial line and potential use of indwelling devices may increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of vasopressors may predis"

   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Worsening respiratory failure, now on
   100% nonrebreather and still satting in mid 80s and looking fatigued.
   Likely due to accelerating worsening RSV or any other of the multiple
   organisms. Currently covered with cefepime, bactrim and ambisome.
   Continued concern for embolic event though LENI
s negative and echo
   negative for R-sided strain, and severely thrombocytopenic.  She has
   had little improvement w/ diuresis suggesting volume overload less
   likely contributing to her clinical picture, therefore will likely hold
   on further diuresis.
   - ABG
   - Intubation today volume control tidal volumes 6cc/kg
   - Probable bronch, if so, will send BAL for gram stain, and culture
   - Fentanyl and midazolam for sedation
   - Consider another dose of antibody to tx RSV, will d/w ID
   - Continue ambisome (for fungal infection), bactrim (for
   stenotrophomonas), and cefepime empirically
   - Continue vanc per ID
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Consider a-line
   HYPOTENSION: Began after intubation, likely secondary to positive
   pressure support. Worsening pulmonary infection leading to sepsis also
   likely co-contributor.
   -2 pressors, s/p fluid boluses (2.5L NS)
   -Family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] to discuss outcomes and options
   RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS: pH 7.22 after increasing RR and adding 2 amps of
   bicarb (RR and Vt affects PCO2 and pH, whereas FiO2 and PEEP affect
   PO2).
   - Consider more bicarb
   - Continue current parameters while trying to wean FiO2
   - No SBT as pt is critically ill
   - Chlorhexadine, HOB for VAP PPX
   2. Tachycardia: Patient remains with sinus tachycardia likely [**2-21**]
   hypoxia.  Also with element of anxiety.
   - Treat respiratory failure as outlined
   - Ativan prn
   3.  Thrombocytopenia: 5 this am s/p transfusion. Persistent
   thrombocytopenia [**2-21**] chemo requiring frequent platelet transfusions.
   - Follow and transfuse for platelets<10 or signs of bleeding
   4. Neutropenia: Pt has had persistent neutropenia requiring
   - neutropenic precautions
   - continue neupogen
   5. Anemia: Stable, w/ neg DIC labs.
   6. Refractory CLL: Patient has had a prior allo SCT with relapse of her
   disease, most recently treated with bendamustine and rituximab [**12-28**].
   Does not desire further treatment
   - continue budesonide for GI GVHD, which is theoretically not
   systemically absorbed
   - holding acyclovir for prophylaxis as pt low risk
   7. GERD: Continue home omeprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and previous allo SCT, admitted to the MICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient has worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a current oxygen saturation in the mid-80s on 100% FiO2. She is also experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, pneumonia, pancytopenia, and chronic leukemia. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires aggressive management including sedation with fentanyl and midazolam, continuation of antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening despite being on 100% nonrebreather, indicating a severe compromise in oxygenation. This can lead to further deterioration in her condition and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's worsening pulmonary infection suggests a possible septic process, which can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially multiple organ failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering her critical state and potential need for invasive procedures.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia (low counts of red and white blood cells and platelets) puts her at risk for infections, bleeding"

   -Pt intubated in the morning placed on AC
   -Restarted vancomycin per ID
   - Family meetings and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]: patient expressed desire to be
   intubated. After intubated, family wanted to terminally extubate
   -Family mtg today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] to reconvene and see how long this
   trial is going to go before we consider comfort measures
   -Pt was tachycardic to 160s sinus tach vs SVT, adenosine 6 ONCE, then

   - started on amio bolus, then started gtt then stopped when put on
   neosynephrine for hypotension, after which heart rate improved
   -Hypotension, got 500cc x 3, started neosynephrine, then levophed with
   good effect. Heart rate remained low 100s.
   -Post-intubation worsening PCO2, FiO2 decreased, RR went from 18 to 24,
   repeat ABG worse at 7.13/85/111, RR decreased pt more dysynchronous
   with ventilator, repeated CXR, improved with paralytics
   -OGT looked good placement
   -ID decided against redosing RSV antibodies
   -switched her back to PO bactrim on the following dose 2 DS tabs QID
   which is the tx dose equivalent
   -Pt became increasing acidotic and hypercarbic throughout the night. At
   first was dysyncrhonous with vent. After paralytics and fent/midaz
   improved but still acidotic. Switched vents because of suspected air
   leak with no effect. Started to increase RR with some success. No
   autopeeping even at rates of 28. Tried increasing to 34 to try to
   further improve acidosis.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57F CLL s/p BMT / relapse admitted with
   respiratory distress / hypoxemia in the setting of viral (RSV) / fungal
   / polymicrobial pneumonia. Intubated yesterday, now with MODS.
   Progressive tachycardia and hypotension. Remains on 2 vasopressors
   (levo/neo). Worsening resp acidosis and hypercarbia on ACV, some
   improvement with paralytic, adjustment of MV/RR on vent.  Antibx

   and vanco, s/p pavilizumab with ID following. We f/u pending cxs. We
   continue ACV support, weaning FiO2 for paO2 > 60. Her resp acidosis has
   improved with current vent setting with higher MV and improved vent
   synchrony at current level of sedation. We will tolerate permissive
   hypercapnea.  She is now in shock, most likely septic with underlying
   preload dependence and worsening in setting of positive pressure
   ventilation/peep and sedation. She has been adequately fluid resuc and
   remains on 2 vasopressors to maintain MAPS > 60.  She is newly in ARF,
   from hypoperfusion/hypotension, becoming anuric.  We will renally dose
   meds.No acute indication for HD, though given her prognosis,  HD is not
   an appropriate option. Her tachycardia has improved with sedation and
   resp support, though she remains in ST. For thrombocytopenia - we
   will transfuse if <10 or bleeding.  We will follow DIC labs, hct
   remains stable. In terms of malignancy /  BMT - off immunosupression,
   and we continue GVH rx with PO budesonide. For neutropenia - continue
   GCSF.  We continue to communicate and update family and offer support,
   as we honor pt's wishes at this time for aggressive care.  Prognosis
   for meaningful recovery is grim.  Picc, a-line, boots, PPI. Remainder
   of plan as outlined above.

   Total time: 50 min
   Addendum:
   I met with pt's family and updated them as to her current condition.
   Family expresses wishes to transition to aggressive comfort and I have
   explained that at this time we are honoring pt's expressed wishes for
   aggressive care.  Despite this she continues to decline, now in MODS.
   I have contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**], who will also speak with our team and pt's
   family. Clergy support this am.  Family declined SW support.  After
   speaking and updating Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**], we met together with pt's family.
   All questions were answered.  Family expressing frustration, as they
   feel the inevitable is being prolonged.  Family reassured that pt is
   comfortable.  They understand our ethical obligation to honor pt's
   wishes, which we have been doing.  At this time, given MODS and poor
   prognosis, we will not further escalate care, but will continue with
   the current level of support and reassess.  Would consider ethics
   consult, as family may find this helpful.
   Additional critical care time spent in family meetings and clinical
   discussions: 90 min.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed CLL, fungal pneumonia, and polymicrobial infection. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated on two pressors. The patient has developed severe septic shock with multi-organ system failure, refractory tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and refractory CLL. She also has impaired skin integrity, GERD, and is at risk for VAP. The patient's prognosis is grim, and the family is considering transitioning to comfort care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and need for intubation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in cardiac arrest or brain damage.
2. Severe septic shock: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction suggest septic shock. If not adequately managed, this can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and lead to death.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required or if there is trauma.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count makes her susceptible to infections, which could worsen her current condition.
5. Anemia: The"

   which is the tx dose equivalent
   -Pt became increasing acidotic and hypercarbic throughout the night. At
   first was dysyncrhonous with vent. After paralytics and fent/midaz
   improved but still acidotic. Switched vents because of suspected air
   leak with no effect. Started to increase RR with some success. No

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), fungal pneumonia, and hospitalization in another facility. She was transferred to this hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is now intubated and on two pressors. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening pulmonary infection, hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, pancytopenia, impaired skin integrity, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 133. She is currently on invasive ventilation support, but her condition remains critical.
2. Worsening Pulmonary Infection: The patient's pulmonary infection is worsening, as indicated by the increasing pulmonary opacities on the chest X-ray and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she requires two pressors to maintain adequate perfusion. This could be secondary to positive pressure support or worsening pulmonary infection leading to sepsis.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to hypoxia, sepsis, or the use of pressors.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. She also"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), fungal PNA (positive nucleic acid test), and previous hospitalization at Hospital 13192. She was transferred to Hospital Unit 1 with hypoxic respiratory failure and is now intubated, anuric (no urine output), acidemic (low pH), and on maximum doses of two pressors.

Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her current condition includes:
1. MODS: The patient is in MODS, which is a severe form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome that affects multiple organ systems. She requires supportive care and fluid and blood product administration should not cause further harm.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which is characterized by low oxygen levels (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170) and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Acidemia: The patient has acidemia with a pH of 7.17, indicating primary respiratory acidosis and concomitant metabolic acidosis. Bicarbonate therapy is not indicated due to the patient's anuria and potential fluid overload.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be related to hypoxia, sepsis, or electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male in the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has been diagnosed with MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome) and is experiencing oliguria/anuria, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, mixed acidosis, acute thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemia, tachycardia, other pneumonia, pancytopenia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, pressors, and blood products. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows improvement in the appearance of apices on the chest X-ray. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is noted as unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and diffuse crackles on lung auscultation suggest the development of ARDS. This can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's mixed acidosis,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of relapsed CLL, fungal PNA, and previous hospitalization. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is now intubated, anuric (no urine output), acidemic, and on two pressors. The patient has multi-organ dysfunction including worsening acidemia, electrolyte abnormalities, anuria, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's prognosis remains very grim, and after discussions with the ethics committee, oncology, and the family, it was decided not to escalate care or initiate dialysis as these would not align with the patient's wishes. The plan is to continue comfort measures and discuss weaning off the ventilator and terminal extubation.

The patient is experiencing tachycardia due to sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities. She also has electrolyte abnormalities secondary to renal failure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is not in line with the patient's goals.

The patient is transfusion-dependent for anemia and thrombocytopenia but further transfusions may be more harmful given her volume overload and anuria.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including a PICC line and arterial line. Prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP are being implemented.

Overall, the patient"
