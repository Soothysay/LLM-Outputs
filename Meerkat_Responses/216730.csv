   Assessment and Plan
   18F presents with transaminitis following recent acetaminophen
   overdose, concerning for suicide attempt.
   1. Acute hepatic failure, acetaminophen overdose
   Very likely secondary to recent massive acetaminophen overdose. If time
   course accurate, patient is well above the treatment line on the
   Rumack-[**Doctor Last Name 4897**] nomogram. Less likely infectious, ischemic, or
   autoimmune in etiology. Transaminases and INR elevated today, despite
   NAC
   - Continue IV NAC per toxicology guidelines: 50mg/kg over 4 hrs then
   100mg/kg over 16 hrs, to continue thereafter pending transaminases,
   Tylenol level and INR
   - Continue to check acetaminophen levels q2h til peak
   - Follow INR/ glucose Q4H, LFTs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Holding off on FFP at this point, no active bleeding. Keep type and
   screen active. Will defer on lactulose for now as not encephalopathic
   - Serial neurologic exams monitoring for signs of increased ICP
   - F/u Hepatitis B and C serologies, consent for HIV per liver
   recommendations
   - Abdominal ultrasound with dopplers
   - Zofran prn nausea
   - GI and transplant surgery recommendations appreciated
   .
   2. Leukocytosis
   Probably secondary to stress of acute illness, but will check urine and
   blood cultures and CXR - given high risk for infection with liver
   failure. Reculture if febrile.
   - Continue to follow liver recommendations, at this point no
   prophylaxis for SBP.  Will consider vanc/zosyn in future if needed
   .
   3. h/o abdominal pain-currently pain free
   Unclear if patient is fabricating this to explain her tylenol
   ingestion. Abdominal exam currently benign. Will follow closely, with
   further testing based on changing symptoms or exam.
   .
   4. suspected suicide attempt
   - Psychiatry and social work consults tonight. Monitor with sitter,
   suicide precautions.
   - Attempt to obtain further outside records re ?psych history.
   - Based on patient's poor insight (and apparent passive SI) she does
   not have capacity to refuse care at this time; discussed with
   psychiatry who agreed with this assessment.
   5. hyponatremia
   Suspect this is secondary to volume depletion
   - check serum osms, urine osms and urine lytes
   - IVF resuscitation, follow Na

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a young woman who has been admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure following a recent acetaminophen overdose, which is concerning for a suicide attempt. She also has leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and liver function abnormalities. The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Acute hepatic failure: This can lead to decreased production of proteins necessary for blood clotting, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic disturbances. It can also result in encephalopathy, which may progress to coma if not managed appropriately.

2. Leukocytosis: Although it is likely secondary to stress, there is a risk of infection due to liver failure. Monitoring for signs of infection and timely intervention with antibiotics if necessary are crucial.

3. Hyponatremia: This can lead to neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if severe. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and correction if needed is important.

4. Liver function abnormalities: These abnormalities indicate significant liver damage and dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and other relevant parameters will help guide management and determine the extent of liver injury.

5. Suicidal behavior: The patient's recent suicide attempt indicates a high risk of self-harm. Close monitoring, psychiatric evaluation, and appropriate interventions to ensure patient safety are essential.

6. Potential need for liver transplantation: Given the severity of liver damage, the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acetaminophen overdose. The patient's acetaminophen levels are slowly trending down, indicating that the overdose is being managed. The patient's LFTs (liver function tests), INR (international normalized ratio), and glucose levels are stable.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/54 to 122/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has no assessed peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin level, and slightly low platelet count. Liver enzymes AST and ALT are significantly elevated, indicating liver damage. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels except for low sodium and slightly low potassium. The patient has an elevated lactic acid level and high LDH level, suggesting possible tissue damage or injury.

Fluid analysis shows a positive acetaminophen level, which is gradually decreasing. Imaging and microbiology studies are pending.

The patient has several problems including tylenol overdose, liver function abnormalities, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, hyponatremia (low sodium), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   18F presents with transaminitis following recent acetaminophen
   overdose, concerning for suicide attempt.
   1. Acute hepatic failure, acetaminophen overdose
   - Continue IV NAC 6.25mg/kg/hr until INR <2, Transaminases <1000
   - Follow INR/ glucose Q4H, LFTs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Serial neurologic exams monitoring for signs of increased ICP
   - F/u Hepatitis B and C serologies, consent for HIV per liver
   recommendations
   - GI and transplant surgery recommendations appreciated
   2. Leukocytosis
   Probably secondary to stress of acute illness, but will check urine and
   blood cultures and CXR - given high risk for infection with liver
   failure. Reculture if febrile.
   - Continue to follow liver recommendations, at this point no
   prophylaxis for SBP.  Will consider vanc/zosyn in future if needed
   3. h/o abdominal pain-currently pain free
   Unclear if patient is fabricating this to explain her tylenol
   ingestion. Abdominal exam currently benign. Will follow closely, with
   further testing based on changing symptoms or exam.
   4. suspected suicide attempt
   - Psychiatry and social work consults tonight. Monitor with sitter,
   suicide precautions.
   - Attempt to obtain further outside records re ?psych history.
   - Based on patient's poor insight (and apparent passive SI) she does
   not have capacity to refuse care at this time; discussed with
   psychiatry who agreed with this assessment.
   5. hyponatremia
   Suspect this is secondary to volume depletion
   - check serum osms, urine osms and urine lytes
   - IVF resuscitation, follow Na

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a young woman admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure secondary to an acetaminophen overdose, suspected suicide attempt. She is currently stable, with slowly trending down acetaminophen levels. Vital signs are stable, and her mental status is alert and oriented. She has leukocytosis, possibly due to stress, and hyponatremia, likely secondary to volume depletion. The patient's liver function tests and INR are elevated, but she is responding well to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy. Imaging, microbiology, and viral studies are pending. The patient has been placed on suicide precautions and will be monitored closely. A psychiatric and social work consultation has been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acetaminophen overdose leading to acute hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and INR indicate significant liver injury. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary, and continued administration of NAC is recommended until the INR is below 2 and transaminases are below 1000.

2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state with acute hepatic failure, there is an increased risk of infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt investigation of any signs of infection are crucial. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, and prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) will be considered"

","Summary:
The patient, an 18-year-old woman, was admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure due to acetaminophen overdose. Her transaminase levels continue to rise, but her INR, glucose, and PTT are stable. Acetaminophen levels are decreasing. She is receiving IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and will continue until INR is less than 2 and transaminases are below 1000. Serial neurologic exams are being performed to monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Hepatitis B and C serologies, as well as HIV testing, have been consented for. The patient is also being evaluated for potential liver transplantation. Leukocytosis is improving and is likely due to acute stress. Cultures are pending. The patient attempted suicide, and psychiatry and social work follow-up have been arranged. She has resolved hyponatremia and is expected to continue in the ICU for now, with possible consultation with a psychiatrist later today."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a young woman, was admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure due to acetaminophen overdose. She had taken an unknown quantity of Tylenol after experiencing abdominal pain while shopping. The patient denies it being a suicide attempt but is willing to talk with psychiatry. Her transaminases, bilirubin, and INR have peaked and are now trending down. The acetaminophen level is undetectable. She continues to look well considering the quantity of ingestion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hepatic failure due to acetaminophen overdose: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), bilirubin, and INR indicate acute hepatic failure. Continued monitoring of these levels, as well as glucose levels, is necessary. Serial neurologic exams should be performed to monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
2. Suicide attempt: The patient's ingestion of Tylenol raises concerns about a potential suicide attempt. She has denied this, but further evaluation by psychiatry and social work is required. She may need psych hospitalization and cannot refuse life-saving treatment or leave against medical advice (AMA).
3. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient is showing signs of orthostasis, which can be a complication of liver failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and ensuring adequate hydration is essential.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocyt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status and evidence of multiorgan dysfunction. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and abnormal renal function. The patient has a history of abdominal pain after traveling to [**Location (un)**] and took Tylenol without knowing the appropriate dosage. She denies any intentional overdose. The patient is willing to speak with psychiatry but requires a translator. Her vital signs are stable, but she is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Her respiratory support is not required, and her ABG results show a mixed acid-base disorder. Peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examinations are not assessed due to her unresponsiveness. The patient's blood cultures are positive for CMV IgG antibodies and EBV IgG antibodies, indicating past infections. The patient has elevated WBC count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver and kidney function tests. Glucose levels are elevated, and electrolyte imbalances are present. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. She is on prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a young woman who presented to the ICU with acute hepatic failure due to acetaminophen overdose. She has been experiencing abdominal pain after traveling to [**Location (un)**] and took an unknown amount of Tylenol, which she had never taken before. The patient denies any intention of suicide but is willing to speak with psychiatry. She requires a translator for communication. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight decrease in blood pressure. She is on IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent further liver damage from acetaminophen toxicity. The patient's transaminase levels are still elevated, but her INR and glucose levels are stable. She is being monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Further testing for hepatitis B and C serologies, as well as HIV, is recommended. The patient also has leukocytosis and hyponatremia, which have resolved. She is on a regular diet and does not require intravenous fluids anymore. The patient is currently in the ICU and may be transferred to the floor after further evaluation. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver function, potential infections due to immunosuppression, and possible neurological complications."
