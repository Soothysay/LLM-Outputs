   4) Acute MI
   Patient with DKA, with unclear precipitating factor; patient may have
   had a viral gastroenteritis, although the GI symptoms more likely
   reflected consequences of the acidemia. MI can also be cause of DKA and
   patient had ECG changes and elevated enzymes. Patient has correctly
   nicely with resolution of acidosis and electrolytes repleted. Patient
   switched to subcutaneous insulin. Begin feeding.
   Acute elevation in creatinine on admission probably reflects volume
   depletion. Has improved with volume resuscitation. Still probably
   volume depleted; continue fluids today.
   No clear evidence of infection now. Antibiotics to be stopped.
   Continue aspirin for myocardial ischemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), nausea/vomiting, renal failure, and a possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient received insulin infusion, antibiotics, volume resuscitation, and ASA for ST changes on ECG. Troponin levels rose to 0.55, and CPK was 220. The patient's ECG showed resolution of lateral ST depressions. 

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, but the precipitating factor is unclear. The acidemia may have caused gastrointestinal symptoms, and there is a possibility of a viral gastroenteritis. However, the symptoms could also be a consequence of the acidemia. 
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had an acute elevation in creatinine on admission, which was likely due to volume depletion. The creatinine levels improved with volume resuscitation. 
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient experienced nausea and vomiting, which were likely related to the acidemia. 
4. Acute myocardial infarction (MI): The patient had ECG changes and elevated enzymes, indicating a possible MI. The patient was given aspirin for myocardial ischemia. 

Plan:
1. Continue subcutaneous insulin to manage DKA.
2. Begin feeding to provide nutrition.
3. Continue fluids to address acute renal failure"

   function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is mild (non-obstructive) focal
   hypertrophy of the basal septum. The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2118-12-6**], the findings are similar.

   days' duration, and found to be in DKA.
   1) DKA: gap closed yesterday. DDx for precipitating factor include
   diarrhea, gastroparesis, c.diff, mi, infection. Did not restart abx
   after the single dose of levaquin in ED as pt without s/s of infection.
   Trigger may likely be retained Tampon, left in place x 5 days.
   - Can monitor lytes daily now
   - Continue D5
 NS with K until pt tolerating PO
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following. Humalog sliding scale written per recs. Pt to start
   basal insulin dose Lantus 15u at 5pm, then have Insulin and D51/2NS
   drip d/c
ed once tolerates dinner this evening.
   - Continue finger sticks
   - Urine culture NGTD
   - F/u on pending blood culture
   .
   2) Right heel ulcer
   - followed as outpt
   - podiatry consulted, saw pt
s foot in recent weeks and report that
   ulcer status improved. continue Adaptic and gauze dressing for now.
   3) DM, type 1: as above.
   - Re-starting Lantus at 15u today. Will d/c insulin drip and D5 1/2NS
   in evening once pt tolerates dinner.
   4) ARF: resolving. Currently Cr 0.7. Cr 1.7 on admission. No recent
   labs to confirm baseline, however, Cr improving with hydration, thus
   likely pre-renal.
   - U/S of transplanted kidney showing mild pelviectasis- check
   significance
   - Will continue to monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology but resolved.
   6) S/p renal transplant:
   - Continue current immunosuppressive regimen
   - Tacrolimus 4.2 this am (slightly sub-therapeutic). Consider
   re-dosing.
   - Renal team aware of pt's admission. F/u on recs if any.
   7) EKG changes, likely demand ischemia due to tachycardia, mild
   troponin leak but CK WNL. Chest pain this a.m.
   - CE
s re-checked this a.m. Tp trending down (0.44, peak of 0.86
   yesterday.) EKG this a.m. unchanged from previous, with no new signs of
   ischemia/infarction.
   - Continue fluid resuscitation PRN.
   - Cardiology following. F/u on recs.
   - defer heparin gtt for now
   - Continue Aspirin 325 daily, Atorvastatin 80 daily, Isosorbide
   Dinitrate 20 [**Hospital1 **], Metoprolol 50 tid, Lasix 20 daily at home dosages.
   8) Depression:
   - continue cymbalta

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of Type I Diabetes and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant in 2018. She presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and was found to be in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood sugar levels were initially low but improved with the administration of dextrose and insulin. She is currently on an insulin drip and D5 1/2NS infusion.

The patient's abdominal pain and leg pain from the previous day have resolved. However, she reports substernal chest tightness, which was also mentioned by a cardiology fellow. The patient has a history of intermittent chest pain without any specific triggers.

The patient has allergies to Demerol (meperidine HCl), iodine, augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate), and an unknown allergy to antibiotics. She received vancomycin on 08/24/2125.

   Type I Diabetes with ESRD s/p renal transplant in [**2118**] on chronic
   immunosuppressive agents, who presents with nausea and vomiting of 4
   days' duration, and found to be in DKA.
   1) DKA: gap decreasing
   - aggressive hydration/ add K to IVF as needed
   - Insulin drip and Finger sticks per DKA protocol
   - check Chemistry Q 4 hrs, follow anion gap
   2) Right heel ulcer
   - followed as outpt
   - podiatry consult in AM, continue Adaptic and gauze dressing for now.
   3) DM, type 1: on Insulin drip at this time.
   - Will re-start home regimen once stable.
   4) ARF: Cr 1.7 on admission. No recent labs to confirm baseline,
   however, Cr improving with hydration, thus likely pre-renal.
   - U/S of transplanted kidney showing mild pelviectasis- check
   significance of
   - Will continue to monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology. UCG neg. Given large
   RBCs in urine, pt may have nephrolithiasis. Will check with radiology
   in AM regarding the significance of pelviectasis
   6) S/p renal transplant:
   - Continue current immunosuppressive regimen in AM
   - check tacrolimus level given pt's renal insufficiency
   - Renal team aware of pt's admission, request consult in AM
   7) EKG changes, likely demand ischemia due to tachycardia, mild
   troponin leak but CK WNL
   - f/u second set of cardiac enzymes
   - fluid resuscitation
   - defer heparin gtt for now
   - recheck EKG in AM
   - Continue Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Metoprolol at
   home dosages.
   8) Depression:
   - continue cymbalta
   9) FEN
   - clears for now, advance to cardiac/diabetic diet as tolerated.
   - Replete lytes PRN, especially K

Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 47-year-old female with a medical history significant for Type I Diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplantation in [2118]. She presented with nausea and vomiting for 4 days and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is receiving insulin and IV fluids for DKA management. Her labs show elevated blood glucose levels and an increased anion gap, consistent with DKA. She also has elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and creatinine levels. Troponin-T is slightly elevated, but other cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. She has a history of depression and is on cymbalta. She has ongoing issues related to her renal transplant, including potential renal artery stenosis, lower abdominal tenderness, and mild pelviectasis on ultrasound. Her EKG shows changes consistent with demand ischemia, and she has mild troponin leak but normal CK levels. She is currently on immunosuppressive agents and requires close monitoring of her renal function and medication dosages. She has multiple"

   A/P
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old female with medical history significant for
   Type I Diabetes with ESRD s/p renal transplant in [**2118**] on chronic
   immunosuppressive agents, who presents with nausea and vomiting of 4
   days' duration, and found to be in DKA.
   1) DKA: gap decreasing
   - aggressive hydration/ add K to IVF as needed
   - Insulin drip and Finger sticks per DKA protocol
   - check Chemistry Q 4 hrs, follow anion gap
   2) Right heel ulcer
   - followed as outpt
   - podiatry consult in AM, continue Adaptic and gauze dressing for now.
   3) DM, type 1: on Insulin drip at this time.
   - Will re-start home regimen once stable.
   4) ARF: Cr 1.7 on admission. No recent labs to confirm baseline,
   however, Cr improving with hydration, thus likely pre-renal.
   - U/S of transplanted kidney showing mild pelviectasis- check
   significance of
   - Will continue to monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology. UCG neg. Given large
   RBCs in urine, pt may have nephrolithiasis. Will check with radiology
   in AM regarding the significance of pelviectasis
   6) S/p renal transplant:
   - Continue current immunosuppressive regimen in AM
   - check tacrolimus level given pt's renal insufficiency
   - Renal team aware of pt's admission, request consult in AM
   7) EKG changes, likely demand ischemia due to tachycardia, mild
   troponin leak but CK WNL
   - f/u second set of cardiac enzymes
   - fluid resuscitation
   - defer heparin gtt for now
   - recheck EKG in AM
   - Continue Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Metoprolol at
   home dosages.
   8) Depression:
   - continue cymbalta
   9) FEN
   - clears for now, advance to cardiac/diabetic diet as tolerated.
   - Replete lytes PRN, especially K

   Addendum after ICU team rounds:
   Repeat CK and Trop showing ischemia. Started heparin gtt, ASA 325,
   statin 80, metoprolol 50, and cards consulted.
   1)       DKA: anion gap now closed. No clear source for trigger. DDx
   include diarrhea, gastroparesis, c.diff, mi, infection. Did not restart
   abx after the single dose of levaquin in ED as pt without s/s of
   infection. Will check c. diff. get [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult. Send surveillance B

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of Type I Diabetes and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplantation in 2018. She presents with nausea and vomiting for 4 days and was found to be in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues, including DKA, a right heel ulcer, acute renal failure (ARF), lower abdominal tenderness, post-renal transplant management, EKG changes indicating possible ischemia, depression, and nutritional concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient's condition needs to be closely monitored as she is still in DKA. Aggressive hydration, insulin drip, and regular fingerstick glucose monitoring are necessary. Chemistry tests should be repeated every 4 hours to follow the anion gap.
2. Right heel ulcer: The patient's right heel ulcer requires ongoing assessment and management. A podiatry consult has been requested, and the current treatment involves an Adaptic and gauze dressing.
3. ARF: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, especially since her creatinine levels have improved with hydration. Further evaluation of the transplanted kidney's function is needed, and medications should be dosed accordingly.
4. Lower abdominal tenderness: The etiology of the lower abdominal tenderness is unclear, and further investigation is required. Given the presence of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been closely monitored, with various interventions and treatments implemented. These include the placement of a PICC line, removal of a retained tampon, administration of medications such as insulin, Lasix, Requip, Mycophenolate, Tacrolimus, Prednisone, Plavix, Bactrim, Lipitor, Lopressor, and Famotidine.

The patient's allergies include Demerol (meperidine HCl), iodine, and augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate). The last dose of antibiotics given was vancomycin on 08/24/2125 at 02:43 PM.

The patient is currently receiving an insulin drip to manage their blood sugar levels, which have been fluctuating between 50-60 and then rising to 170. The goal is to transition the patient back to d51/2 insulin and attempt to resume oral intake.

Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, which has resolved with hydration, and an episode of nausea and vomiting that has significantly improved. The patient also experienced a suspected acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), for which a cardiology consultation was obtained. The patient was prescribed ASA, a beta-blocker, and Plavix.

The patient's vital signs have been monitored closely, with a maximum temperature of 37.8°C"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old female with medical history significant for
   Type I Diabetes with ESRD s/p renal transplant in [**2118**] on chronic
   immunosuppressive agents, who presents with nausea and vomiting of 4
   days' duration, and found to be in DKA.
   1) DKA: gap closed yesterday. DDx for precipitating factor include
   diarrhea, gastroparesis, c.diff, mi, infection. Did not restart abx
   after the single dose of levaquin in ED as pt without s/s of infection.
   Trigger may likely be retained Tampon, left in place x 5 days.
   - Can monitor lytes daily now
   - Continue D5
 NS with K until pt tolerating PO
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following. Humalog sliding scale written per recs. Pt to start
   basal insulin dose Lantus 15u at 5pm, then have Insulin and D51/2NS
   drip d/c
ed once tolerates dinner this evening.
   - Continue finger sticks
   - Urine culture NGTD
   - F/u on pending blood culture
   .
   2) Right heel ulcer
   - followed as outpt
   - podiatry consulted, saw pt
s foot in recent weeks and report that
   ulcer status improved. continue Adaptic and gauze dressing for now.
   3) DM, type 1: as above.
   - Re-starting Lantus at 15u today. Will d/c insulin drip and D5 1/2NS
   in evening once pt tolerates dinner.
   4) ARF: resolving. Currently Cr 0.7. Cr 1.7 on admission. No recent
   labs to confirm baseline, however, Cr improving with hydration, thus
   likely pre-renal.
   - U/S of transplanted kidney showing mild pelviectasis- check
   significance
   - Will continue to monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology but resolved.
   6) S/p renal transplant:
   - Continue current immunosuppressive regimen
   - Tacrolimus 4.2 this am (slightly sub-therapeutic). Consider
   re-dosing.
   - Renal team aware of pt's admission. F/u on recs if any.
   7) EKG changes, likely demand ischemia due to tachycardia, mild
   troponin leak but CK WNL. Chest pain this a.m.
   - CE
s re-checked this a.m. Tp trending down (0.44, peak of 0.86
   yesterday.) EKG this a.m. unchanged from previous, with no new signs of
   ischemia/infarction.
   - Continue fluid resuscitation PRN.
   - Cardiology following. F/u on recs.
   - defer heparin gtt for now
   - Continue Aspirin 325 daily, Atorvastatin 80 daily, Isosorbide
   Dinitrate 20 [**Hospital1 **], Metoprolol 50 tid, Lasix 20 daily at home dosages.
   8) Depression:
   - continue cymbalta
   9) FEN
   - Advance to cardiac/diabetic diet as tolerated.
   - Replete lytes PRN, especially K
   .
   10) Access
   - two PIVs. PICC now in place ([**8-25**])
   .
   11) PPx
   - Heparin SQ, Famotidine
   .
   12) Code: DNR, but ok to intubate. I confirmed with patient today
   ([**2125-8-25**]). Husband present.
   .
   13) Dispo: ICU until glucose WNL and stable.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of Type I Diabetes with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplant in [**2118**] and is on chronic immunosuppressive agents. She presented with nausea and vomiting for 4 days and was found to be in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient also has a right heel ulcer, Type I Diabetes, Acute Renal Failure (ARF), lower abdominal tenderness, post-renal transplant issues, EKG changes suggestive of demand ischemia, mild troponin leak, chest pain, depression, fluid electrolyte imbalance, and is on multiple medications including insulin, immunosuppressants, cardiac/diabetic diet, and antibiotics. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status but is okay to intubate, and is being kept in the ICU until her glucose levels are normal and she is stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant. She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) without a clear trigger, but it was suspected that a retained tampon may have contributed. Her blood glucose levels have improved, and she is now off the insulin drip, back on Lantus, and tolerating an oral diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) DM - The patient has a history of type I diabetes, which puts her at risk for recurrent episodes of DKA if not managed properly. It is important to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels and adjust her Lantus dosage as needed.
2) Renal Transplant - As the patient had an ESRD and underwent a renal transplant, she is at risk for complications related to the transplant. Regular monitoring of her creatinine levels and immunosuppressant medications is necessary to ensure the success of the transplant.
3) Heel Ulcer - The presence of a heel ulcer indicates poor circulation or pressure sores, which can be common in patients with diabetes and immobility. Proper wound care and regular follow-up with a podiatrist are essential to prevent further complications.
4) CAD - The patient's history of CAD post CABG puts her at risk for recurrent cardiac events. It is important to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of Type I Diabetes and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who underwent renal transplantation in [**2118**]. She presented with nausea and vomiting for 4 days and was found to be in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's DKA has resolved, but she had multiple potential precipitating factors including diarrhea, gastroparesis, Clostridium difficile infection, myocardial infarction, infection, and viral gastroenteritis. The patient was started on vancomycin due to a retained tamponade that was left in place for 5 days. However, the patient is allergic to Augmentin, which is the best alternative for empirical treatment of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and she will be monitored for clinical symptoms and WBC trend after discontinuing antibiotics.

The patient's urine culture was negative, and her blood culture for the nasogastric tube (NGTD) was also negative. The patient's right heel ulcer has improved, and she will continue with adaptive and gauze dressing. She is scheduled for an outpatient follow-up with a podiatrist.

The patient's type 1 diabetes is being managed as previously recommended. Her acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, with creatinine levels improving from 1.7 on admission to 0.7 this morning."
