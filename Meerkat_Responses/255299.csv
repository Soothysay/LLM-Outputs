   [**Name (NI) 66**] status:  Full
   Disposition: MICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prior admissions for urosepsis, who is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient presented with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea, indicating signs of sepsis. His white blood cell count initially was 21, now 24.4. An abdominal CT scan revealed air in the gallbladder wall, and a bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed, resulting in purulent fluid aspiration. The initial gram stain showed gram-positive rods and cocci as well as gram-negative rods with 3+ leukocytes. The patient's urine culture was negative.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, daptomycin, and cefepime. He is awaiting sensitivity results to narrow antibiotic coverage. The plan includes follow-up blood and urine cultures, obtaining sputum and stool cultures, serial arterial blood gases (ABGs), surgical consultation for abdominal evaluation, and consideration of an abdominal CT scan when more stable.

The patient also has respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and volume overload, leading to intubation on [**5-30**] at ~0630 due to increased work of breathing and hypoventilation. The chest X-ray"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis, who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, secondary respiratory failure due to sepsis and volume overload, stage V renal disease/acute on chronic renal failure, and decompensated CHF. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its tissues and organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has secondary respiratory failure due to sepsis and volume overload. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs, resulting in respiratory acidosis and potentially organ dysfunction.
3. Stage V Renal Disease/Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated during this admission, with anuria and increased BUN/Cr ratio. This indicates acute kidney injury on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease, which may progress further if not managed appropriately.
4. Decompensated CHF: The patient's CHF is worsening due to fluid overload from resuscitation, leading to pulmonary edema and reduced cardiac output"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis, who is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). He presented with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Blood cultures showed gram-positive rods and cocci, and a bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed due to air in the gallbladder wall. The patient became hypotensive and required norepinephrine (levophed) support. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, daptomycin, and cefepime, while awaiting sensitivity results. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and volume overload, requiring intubation. He also has stage V renal disease, likely secondary to hypotension, and is anuric with a BUN/Cr ratio of 95/4.8. The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of falls.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The presence of air in the gallbladder wall"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), benign hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted to the MICU with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been experiencing high fevers and rigors, which are concerning for a possible bacterial infection. 

The initial workup showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 21, which has now decreased to 3.1. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but given his history of urosepsis and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a urinary source for the infection is suspected. However, no obvious source has been identified yet. 

The patient also has signs consistent with sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute diastolic heart failure on top of chronic CHF. He is currently receiving multiple antibiotics and has been placed on droplet precautions due to suspected influenza.

Additionally, the patient has stage V renal disease and is not yet on dialysis but still produces urine. He may require hemodialysis in the future if fluid overload becomes a problem. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius (104.4 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 58/34 to 138/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of wheezing. The patient has been intubated due to severe work of breathing, hypoventilation, and volume overload. The patient is also hypotensive despite fluid boluses and increasing levophed. Surgery is actively following the patient and discussing surgical intervention. The patient's allergies include metoprolol. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin, vancomycin, daptomycin, cefipime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently on fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure of 118/53 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's CVP is 19 mmHg, with a total input of 6,060 mL and total output of 5,879 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and ABG results of pH 7.34, PaCO2 44 mmHg, PaO2 270 mmHg, and HCO3- 24 mEq/L. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, total CO2, glucose, and lactic acid. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular or skin assessment due to intubation. The patient's neurologic assessment is also not fully assessed. The patient's diagnosis includes fever, heart failure, hypotension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and abnormal lab results indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis. If not properly managed, this can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current symptoms of hypotension and fluid overload suggest the possibility of acute decompensation. This can lead to further cardiac dysfunction and respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and diagnosis of end-stage renal disease indicate impaired kidney function. This can worsen if not managed appropriately and may result in further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and low respiratory rates indicate the need for respiratory support. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma should be monitored for and managed promptly.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent these complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, renal function, and infection parameters. Timely intervention"

   tachycardia, tachypnea
   # Sepsis:  Pt with high fevers, rigors, tachypnea, tachycardia. WBC
   initially 21, now 16.5 from 22.3 yesterday afternoon.  Abd CT shows air
   in gallbladder wall.  Bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain placed by
   IR [**5-29**] with purulent fluid aspirated.  Initial gram stain showed gm+
   rods & cocci as well as gm
 rods with 3+ leukocytes.   Pts DFA was
   negative.  Urine Cx also negative.  Pt became hypotensive during the
   day on [**5-29**] and levophed was initiated.  His hypotension has persisted
   after intubation on [**5-30**] requiring higher doses of levophed and
   continued fluid boluses.

Septic Source / Cholecystitis
         - Awaiting sensitivities to narrow abx coverage.  Currently on
   Cipro, Flagyl, Dapto, Cefepime.  Will D/C cipro.
         -f/u blood and urine cx, obtain sputum and stool cx as well
         - Surgery actively following patient and appreciate their
   involvement.  If patient deteriorates further may require ex-lap and
   open cholecycstecomy.

 Hypotension: Likely result of sepsis coupled with cardiac injury.
         - Continue Fluid resuscitation until hypotension becomes
   refractory to additional fluid
         - Continue escalating levophed PRN to maintain MAP > 60
         - [**Month (only) 60**] add additional pressor (neosynephrine) as needed to achieve
   MAP goal.  Would not add dobutamine in light of elevated Trop.
          - Was started on stress dose steroids (Solumedrol 125 mg IV
   q8).  If cortisol normal will d/c steroids.
   #Cardiac [**Last Name (un) **] / NSTEMI: Troponin elevation concerning, however given
   patients current status would not treat at this time and will cycle
   enzymes.  If continues to rise will c/s cardiology.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to Sepsis and volume overload.  Pt
   intubated [**5-30**] at ~0630 [**12-30**] increased work of breathing and
   hypoventilation.  ABG as above.  As this is a direct result of both the

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, secondary to cholecystitis. He has also developed hypotension, respiratory failure, stage V renal disease/acute on chronic renal failure, and possibly NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction).

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient presented with high fevers, rigors, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The initial white blood cell count was elevated at 22.3, which decreased to 16.5. The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, and cultures have shown gram-positive rods and cocci as well as gram-negative rods with 3+ leukocytes. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the sensitivity results are still pending.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation and the initiation of vasopressors. This is likely a result of sepsis coupled with cardiac injury.

   tachycardia, tachypnea
   # Sepsis:  Pt with high fevers, rigors, tachypnea, tachycardia. WBC
   initially 21, now 16.5 from 22.3 yesterday afternoon.  Abd CT shows air
   in gallbladder wall.  Bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain placed by
   IR [**5-29**] with purulent fluid aspirated.  Initial gram stain showed gm+
   rods & cocci as well as gm
 rods with 3+ leukocytes.   Pts DFA was
   negative.  Urine Cx also negative.  Pt became hypotensive during the
   day on [**5-29**] and levophed was initiated.  His hypotension has persisted
   after intubation on [**5-30**] requiring higher doses of levophed and
   continued fluid boluses.

Septic Source / Cholecystitis
         - Awaiting sensitivities to narrow abx coverage.  Currently on
   Cipro, Flagyl, Dapto, Cefepime

         - Surgery actively following patient and appreciate their
   involvement.  If patient deteriorates further may require ex-lap and
   open cholecycstecomy.

 Hypotension: Likely result of sepsis coupled with cardiac injury.
         - Continue Fluid resuscitation until hypotension becomes
   refractory to additional fluid
         - Continue escalating levophed PRN to maintain MAP > 60
         - [**Month (only) 60**] add additional pressor (neosynephrine) as needed to achieve
   MAP goal.  Would not add dobutamine in light of elevated Trop.
          - Was started on stress dose steroids (Solumedrol 125 mg IV q8)

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prior admissions for urosepsis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) carrier status. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of fever, chills, tachycardia, and tachypnea.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. He developed sepsis, likely secondary to cholecystitis, as indicated by the presence of air in the gallbladder wall on abdominal CT and purulent fluid aspirated from the gallbladder during a percutaneous drain placement. The initial gram stain showed gram-positive rods and cocci, as well as gram-negative rods with 3+ leukocytes. The patient's DFA test for pneumococcal pneumonia was negative, and his urine culture was also negative.

The patient has experienced persistent hypotension, which has required higher doses of norepinephrine and continued fluid boluses. His blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation. He has been intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and volume overload. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as evidenced by an increase in BUN/Cr from 85/3.9 on admission to 95/4.8. This is likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prior admissions for urosepsis. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to cholecystitis as evidenced by air in the gallbladder wall and purulent fluid aspirated during percutaneous gallbladder drainage. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and awaiting sensitivities to narrow antibiotic coverage. The patient's hypotension has persisted despite fluid resuscitation and the initiation of vasopressors. He also has respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and volume overload, for which he has been intubated. Additionally, the patient has stage V renal disease/acute on chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis. He is also being treated for dCHF, BPH, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a possible femoral neck fracture.

Potential medical complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prior admissions for urosepsis. He was admitted to the MICU with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, secondary to cholecystitis. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but awaits sensitivities to narrow antibiotic coverage. A bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed due to air in the gallbladder wall. The patient's hypotension is likely a result of sepsis and cardiac injury. He is receiving fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. The patient also has stage V renal disease/acute on chronic renal failure, not yet on hemodialysis (HD), and has become anuric during this admission.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis, who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, a percutaneous gallbladder drain due to air in the gallbladder wall, and an infection caused by an unidentified organism in the urine. The patient also has stage V renal disease/acute on chronic renal failure, NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), respiratory failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis is a life-threatening complication that requires immediate medical attention. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and closely monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.

2. Gallbladder issues: The presence of air in the gallbladder wall indicates a possible gallbladder perforation or emphysematous cholecystitis. This condition can lead to further complications such as peritonitis or abscess formation. Close monitoring of the patient's abdominal symptoms and regular imaging studies may be necessary to assess the progress.

3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and anuria suggest acute on chronic renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis, who presented with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
- He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a diagnosis of sepsis.
- An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed air in the gallbladder wall, and a bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed.
- MRCP showed a collapsed gallbladder with the drain inside and no surrounding fluid collections.
- The patient is currently being treated with Flagyl, Dapto, and Cefepime, awaiting sensitivities.
- Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and sputum and stool cultures will also be obtained.
- Surgery is actively following the patient and may require an exploratory laparotomy and open cholecystectomy if the patient deteriorates further.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis coupled with cardiac injury.
- Fluid resuscitation will continue until hypotension becomes refractory to additional fluids.
- Levophed will be administered as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- If the patient's condition deteriorates further, additional pressors (such as neosynephrine) may be added to"

   - appreciate surgery recs
   - continue fluids for hypotension
 pt has been off of pressors since
   yesterday evening
   #Cardiac Enzyme Elevation
   - troponin continued to rise yesterday (up to 0.31)
   - this troponin bump is consistent with demand ischemia in the setting
   of renal failure, which would prevent clearing of the troponin
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - if WBC continues to improve and pt improves clinically, can wean
   ventilator to pressure support to try to get pt extubated
   - will switch to bolus sedation
 this will help in weaning pt
   sedation in preparation for extubation
   - will also switch flagyl to PO
 this will give pt less fluid load and
   make it easier to wean him from vent
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Pt has begun to produce more urine
   - Continue to renally dose meds, but keep in mind that we will have to
   stop this when the pts GFR increases
   - Give pt aluminum hydroxide 30 TID instead of renagel (renagel does
   not work with TFs)

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to a gallbladder infection indicated by air in the gallbladder wall seen on abdominal CT. A percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed, and the patient is currently being treated with antibiotics (Flagyl, Daptomycin, and Cefepime) while awaiting sensitivity results. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes show elevation in troponin levels, which may indicate myocardial injury or demand ischemia due to renal failure. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Plans are in place to wean the patient off the ventilator by switching to pressure support and eventually extubation.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with plans to continue renal dosing of medications while monitoring the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fluid overload is a concern, and measures will be taken to monitor for signs of CHF exacerbation. Medications for BPH and diabetes mellitus type 2 are being held.

The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen central line and an"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and previous admissions for urosepsis who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of rigors, fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, possibly secondary to a gallbladder infection, as evidenced by air in the gallbladder wall on a CT scan. A percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed by interventional radiology. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics including flagyl, dapto, and cefepime, awaiting sensitivity results. Cultures are pending, and the urine culture is growing an unspecified organism. 

The patient also has an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible cardiac involvement, and a consultation with cardiology is recommended. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and there is a plan to wean off mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has stage V renal disease, which has progressed to acute on chronic renal failure during this admission. He is currently anuric (no urine output) with a BUN/Cr ratio of 122/5.9, likely due to hypotension. Renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis, will be necessary soon. 

Other medical conditions include decompensated CHF, BPH, diabetes mellitus type"

   Sepsis now responding to abx with him off pressors, no longer requiring
   boluses.  We are continuing abx, decreasing IVF, dosing all meds for
   renal failure (paying attention to possible improvement in creat
   today), switching to bolus sedation in attempt to move vent to PSV.
   Will discuss possible tube feeds with surgery.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis due to an emphysematous gallbladder. The patient underwent an ERCP which showed no abnormalities in the pancreatic duct, no biliary dilation, or choledocholithiasis. The patient is currently on pressors, receiving antibiotics, and has had blood cultures showing growth of gram-negative rods. The patient's allergies include metoprolol and wheezing. The patient is being diuresed poorly at a rate of 10-20 cc/hr. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to an emphysematous gallbladder, which is a serious infection that can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating acute respiratory failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for dose adjustment of medications for renal failure.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient is suspected to have had an acute myocardial infarction, possibly secondary to sepsis and other underlying conditions.
5. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation or obstipation, which may be due to decreased mobility and medications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, indicating hypocalcemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis due to an emphysematous gallbladder. The patient underwent an ERCP, which showed no abnormalities in the pancreatic duct, no biliary dilation, or choledocholithiasis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PS of 8/5 and 35% FIO2. He is diuresing poorly at a rate of 10-20 cc/hr. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's ABG results indicate good oxygenation and ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to metoprolol, wheezing, and is currently receiving antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, metronidazole, and cefipime. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of sepsis. The patient's flow sheet data shows stable hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values within normal ranges. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable.

   #Cardiac Enzyme Elevation
   - troponin rise to 0.31, felt to be c/w demand ischemia in the setting
   of renal failure, which would prevent clearing of the troponin
   # Respiratory Failure
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - oxygenating and ventilating well on PS 5/5
   - have switched to bolus sedation in preparation for possible
   extubation today

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), previous admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gallbladder. The abdominal CT scan showed air in the gallbladder wall, and a percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed by interventional radiology (IR). The MRCP showed a collapsed gallbladder with the drain inside, but no surrounding fluid collections or ductal dilation. The patient is currently on metronidazole, daptomycin, and cefepime, awaiting sensitivities. Follow-up cultures are also planned. Blood cultures from 05/29 grew Gram-negative rods (GNR) in one bottle, while stool cultures were negative for campylobacter and Clostridium difficile. Sputum cultures were contaminated, and urine cultures grew <[Numeric Identifier 182] organisms/ml. The patient remains off pressors and not requiring fluid boluses. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to an emphysematous gallbladder. The source of infection is the gallbladder, as evidenced by air in the gallbladder wall and the presence of GNR in the blood cultures. The patient is currently being treated with appropriate antibiotics, and follow-up cultures are planned. Surgical recommendations are appreciated.
2. Cardiac enzyme elevation: The patient's troponin level rose to 0.31, which is consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of renal failure. This prevents the clearance of troponin.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be well-oxygenated and ventilated on PS 5/5. ABGs are being monitored, and the patient is being switched to bolus sedation in preparation for possible extubation today. Flagyl has been changed to oral administration to minimize fluid load and facilitate weaning from the ventilator.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient is making 10-20 cc of urine per hour. Renal dosing of medications will be continued, but it is important to note that this will need to be stopped when the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases. Aluminum hydroxide has been given 30 TID instead of renagel (renagel does not work with TFs) for hyperphosphatemia.
5. CHF: The patient's congestive heart failure is being monitored, and signs of fluid overload are being assessed through clinical exam and chest X-ray.
6. BPH: The use of tamsulosin has been held, but finasteride is being continued.
7. DM2: The use of glyburide has been held, but ISS (insulin sensitivity syndrome) is being continued.
8. FEN: The patient is nil per os (NPO), receiving intravenous normal saline. Consideration is being given to total parenteral nutrition (TF) in the next few days.

ICU care:
- Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs are being addressed.
- Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed.
- Lines: The patient has a multi-lumen line placed on 05/29 and an arterial line placed on 05/29.
- Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His head of bed (HOB) is being elevated, and mouth care is being performed daily to prevent VAP.

Code status: The patient has a full code status.

Disposition: The patient is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), previous admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms including rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gall bladder. An abdominal CT scan showed air in the gallbladder wall, and a percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed. The patient is currently on antibiotics, awaiting sensitivity results. Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods, and urine cultures showed the presence of organisms. The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He is also experiencing respiratory failure and acute-on-chronic renal failure. Other medical conditions include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient is being closely monitored for signs of fluid overload related to CHF and is receiving appropriate ICU care."

   Although incr WBC is a concern, overall he is improving.  Will discuss
   abx with ID
 one question is whether he still needs dapto?  Creat is
   rising
 sl incr in UO but suspect he has reached the point at which it
   makes sense to start HD.  We are weaning vent.  He is off sedation and
   we will try an SBT.  Checking C diff. Will start  tube feeds today with
   likely extubation tomorrow.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), previous admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gallbladder. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, and an abdominal CT scan showed air in the gallbladder wall. A percutaneous gallbladder drain was placed, and MRCP showed a collapsed gallbladder with the drain inside, without any surrounding fluid collections or ductal dilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient's troponin levels have risen, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. This could be a result of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to potential myocardial damage.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with positive pressure support. There is a risk of respiratory failure if he does not respond well to weaning off the ventilator or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o male with CHF, prior admissions for urosepsis, VRE carrier who
   is admitted to MICU with rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea,
   emphysematous gall bladder.
   # Sepsis/new leukocytosis
  abdominal CT showed air in gallbladder
   wall, bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain placed by IR [**5-29**]
   - MRCP showed collapsed gallbladder with drain inside - no surrounding
   fluid collections or ductal dilation
   - currently on flagyl, dapto, cefepime (DAY 5)
 awaiting sensitivities
   - consult ID as to whether we need to keep dapto and duration of Rx
   - f/u cultures
 blood cx [**5-29**] growing GNR in one bottle, stool negative
   for campylobacter and c.diff, sputum cs contaminant, urine cx growing
   <[**Numeric Identifier 182**] organisms/ml
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - continue fluids for hypotension
 pt remains off pressors and not
   requiring fluid boluses
   - send C diff toxin assay given leukocytosis, large volume stool, and
   fact that he
s been on 5 days of antibiotic therapy.
   #Cardiac Enzyme Elevation
   - troponin rise to 0.31, felt to be c/w demand ischemia in the setting
   of renal failure, which would prevent clearing of the troponin
   # Respiratory Failure
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - oxygenating and ventilating well on PS 8/5
   - have switched to bolus sedation in preparation for possible
   extubation today or tomorrow
   - flagyl changed to PO
 this will give pt less fluid load and make it
   easier to wean him from vent
   - would like to diurese 2L neg prior to extubation.  Will start bolus +
   lasix gtt but may need HD (pressures can tolerate).
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Pt making 10-20 cc of urine per hr
   - Continue to renally dose meds, but keep in mind that we will have to
   stop this when the pts GFR increases
   - Give pt aluminum hydroxide 30 TID instead of renagel (renagel does
   not work with TFs) for hyperphosphatemia
    # CHF
   -continue to monitor CXR and clinical exam for signs of fluid overload
   # BPH
   -hold tamsulosin, continue finasteride
   # DM2
   - hold glyburide, continue ISS

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, prior admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gall bladder. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a gall bladder infection, and has undergone a percutaneous gall bladder drain. He is currently on antibiotics (flagyl, dapto, cefepime) awaiting sensitivities. The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute on chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary hypertension (BPH), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not properly managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the low urine output and elevated creatinine levels."

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC count suggests an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if ventilatory support is discontinued prematurely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is goal 2L negative for the day, indicating respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation. The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for an infection, specifically cefipime, metronidazole, and daptomycin. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/66 mmHg to 154/148 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen at 35%, and respiratory system compliance index of 15. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is a slight decrease in bicarbonate level. Renal function tests indicate a decrease in creatinine clearance. Liver enzymes and cardiac markers are within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, regular heart rhythm, distended abdomen without tenderness, and edema in the extremities. Imaging studies are not provided in the given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has been mechanically ventilated since admission and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 35%. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.3°C, heart rate 75 bpm, blood pressure 146/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 100% on SpO2. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and other medications including pantoprazole, furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is at risk of worsening renal function, potentially leading to acute renal failure.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has acute decompensated heart failure with diastolic dysfunction on top of chronic heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac deterioration and fluid overload.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, which can lead to muscle cramps, tetany, or arrhythmias.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has high phosphate levels, which can contribute to further renal dysfunction and metabolic bone disease.
7. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation due to immobilization and medications such as pantoprazole.
8. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which increases the risk of further cardiac complications.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require blood transfusions.
10. Cholecystitis: The patient has cholecystitis, which can lead to complications such as gallstone pancreatitis or biliary sepsis.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for an extended period, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
12. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of DVT.
13. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
14. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function is severely compromised, putting him at risk of developing ESRD.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, prior admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gallbladder. The patient underwent a percutaneous gallbladder drain placement by interventional radiology (IR) and had a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) that showed a collapsed gallbladder with the drain inside, without any surrounding fluid collections or ductal dilation. The patient remains off pressors and not requiring fluid boluses, showing clinical improvement. His white blood cell (WBC) count is stable.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Leukocytosis: The patient has sepsis and leukocytosis, indicated by fever, rigors, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The presence of Enterococcus in the biliary fluid suggests ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 15. He is expected to be extubated soon.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), previous admissions for urosepsis, and being a carrier of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). He was admitted to the MICU with symptoms including rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gallbladder. An abdominal CT scan showed air in the gallbladder wall, leading to the placement of a percutaneous gallbladder drain. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has been stable, and he has been improving clinically. He is currently on antibiotics for suspected sepsis, awaiting sensitivity results. Cultures have been taken, including blood, stool, sputum, and urine, with some growing gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient's respiratory status is good, and he is expected to be extubated soon. He also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and dialysis is being considered. His CHF is currently stable, and his other medical conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FEN) are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to his symptoms and the presence of GNR in some cultures. Appropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving invasive ventilation. They have a history of allergies to metoprolol and wheezing, as well as previous antibiotic treatments. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/61 mmHg to 155/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a weight of 99 kg, with a height of 65 inches. 

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 998 mL and output of 2,590 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,592 mL. The respiratory support shows the patient is on standby ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 742 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and plateau pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 135 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22 mEq/L, base excess (-3), ventilation (Ve) of 5.6 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 386.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and lactate. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), glucose, electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-/Ca++), and liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili) are within normal limits or slightly elevated. 

The patient has an arterial line and multi-lumen line inserted, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, but with potential medical complications related to their respiratory support and elevated lab values indicating possible infection or organ dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), who has been admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to rigors, fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and an emphysematous gallbladder. The patient has a past admission for urosepsis and is a carrier of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). 

The patient's recent abdominal CT scan showed air in the gallbladder wall, leading to the placement of a bedside percutaneous gallbladder drain by interventional radiology (IR). The drain was confirmed to be in place without any surrounding fluid collections or ductal dilation on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The patient remains off pressors and is not requiring fluid boluses, showing clinical improvement. 

Laboratory results indicate the presence of leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count ranging from 16.0 to 24.8 thousand/mm3. Blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods (GNR) in one bottle, while stool and sputum cultures were negative for specific pathogens. Urine cultures grew <[Numeric Identifier 182] organisms/ml. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable, allowing for planned extubation. He is oxygenating and ventilating well on a pressure support (PS) level of 5, with a respiratory"
