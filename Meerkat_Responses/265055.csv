","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chest pain and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. fib with RVR). During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced a code blue event after experiencing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, sweating, and clamminess. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, and heart rate was 180 bpm. The patient was given Lopressor IV and nitroglycerin, resulting in resolution of chest pain and improved heart rate in the 70s.

Since discharge from the MICU, the patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placed and the right internal jugular vein was attempted but unsuccessful. Hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has not been started.

The patient's allergies include aspirin, with unknown details. The last dose of antibiotics, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), was administered on [**2172-10-25**] at 03:58 PM.

The patient is currently on several medications, including Oxycodone PRN, Pantoprazole, Zosyn, Fluconazole, and Zofran PRN. Additionally, the patient takes Ferrous Sulfate 325 daily and receives MVI.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned above.

   24 Hour Events:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2275**] is well known to the MICU green team.  He was admitted
   initially for GI bleed at anastamosis site of prior Bilroth surgery.
   He required 3 units PRBCs but remained hemodynamically stable.  He was
   called out to CC7 two days ago. Since discharge from MICU, patient had
   PICC placed.  Right IJ was pulled.  Hct was stable.  He was not started
   on TPN.
   Prior to Code Blue, patient was lying in bed.  He developed sudden
   substernal crushing chest pain and was noted to be diaphoretic, cool.
   He was noted to have A. fib with RVR.  A code blue was called at 9:30
   AM.  He was given NGLx2 with improvement of chest pain.  He was given
   Lopressor 5 IV x 1 and HR improved to 70s.   He remained
   hemodynamically stable and did not loose a pulse during the event.

   1.  Chest pain.  Patient developed crushing SSCP in setting of A. fib
   with RVR with HR in 170s.  ST depressions in V1-V6, II, F.    Normal
   Ech on [**2172-10-22**].  Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia.
   High suspicion for cardiac chest pain.
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - daily EKGs
   - keep HR < 70 with digoxin, standing and prn lopressor
   - nitroglycerin prn SSCP
   - initiate lopressor 12.5 PO BID and uptitrate to keep rate in 70s or
   less
   - start simvastatin
   - consider cards consult if he rules in
   - NPO
   2.  A. fib.  Patient has episode of A. fib with RVR.  Precipitant
   remains unclear though high suspicion for PE given that he has a
   pleuritic element and known significant upper extremity clot burden.
   (Of note, patient has old IVC filter in place).  Has been off HSQ
   during hospital stay due to GIB.  Not on aspirin due to aspirin
   allergy.   Has been getting IVF for NPO status on floor, so less likely
   to be dehydrated.
   - continue digoxin
   - initiate lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - prn IV lopressor
   - CTA to rule out PE
   - monitor on tele
   3.  UGIB.  Bleeding source may be friability at anastamosis site from
   prior bilroth surgery.  Hct stable.  Now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.  No
   transfusiosn since [**2172-10-23**].  Anticoagulation for PE or ACS will be
   challenging given GI bleed.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - surgery following
 conservative management
   - Daily hcts, but switch to TID hcts if patient gets anticoagulated
   (pending CTA results)
   - liver following
   - NPO
   .
   4.  Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving, but will continue NPO for now. There was
   discussion about doing TPN given that patient has been NPO for several
   days.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          NPO for now, consider TPN tomorrow
   .
   5.        B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.
   -hold on anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed, however, may get
   anticoagulated pending results of PE CT
   - IR consult for possible SVC filter
   - outpatient age appropriate cancer screening

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed from anastomosis site and microperforation of the bowel. The patient developed sudden substernal crushing chest pain, diaphoresis, and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A code blue was called, and the patient received naloxone and Lopressor, which improved his condition. The patient has reversed his DNR/DNI status. He has been off heparin during his hospital stay due to gastrointestinal bleeding and has a known significant upper extremity clot burden. The patient's current medications include Oxycodone PRN, Pantoprazole, Zosyn, Fluconazole, Zofran PRN, Ferrous Sulfate 325 daily, MVI, and Lopressor 5 IV x 1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain: The patient developed crushing substernal chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. ST depressions in V1-V6, II, F were noted on the EKG, indicating demand ischemia. High suspicion for cardiac chest pain.

   2.  A. fib.  Patient has episode of A. fib with RVR.  Precipitant
   remains unclear though high suspicion for PE given that he has a
   pleuritic element and known significant upper extremity clot burden.
   (Of note, patient has old IVC filter in place).  Has been off HSQ
   during hospital stay due to GIB.  Not on aspirin due to aspirin
   allergy.   Has been getting IVF for NPO status on floor, so less likely
   to be dehydrated.

   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving, but will continue NPO for now. There was
   discussion about doing TPN given that patient has been NPO for several
   days.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.

   5.        B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from an anastomosis site and microperforation of the bowel. During his stay in the ICU, he experienced chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which resulted in a code blue event. The patient's code status was reversed from DNR/DNI to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain: The patient developed crushing substernal chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR. There were ST depressions in V1-V6, II, F on EKG, indicating a high suspicion for cardiac chest pain. Serial cardiac enzymes, daily EKGs, and medication adjustments were initiated to manage this condition.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR. This could be due to a precipitant such as pulmonary embolism (PE), especially given the pleuritic element and known significant upper extremity clot burden. A CT angiography (CTA) was ordered to rule out PE, and digoxin was continued to manage the atrial fibrillation.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The bleeding source may be friability at the anastomosis site from prior bilroth surgery"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient experienced a code blue event at 9:30 am due to substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and high heart rate. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin and unknown medications. The patient was receiving piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics until 10/25/2172 at 3:58 pm. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), low blood pressure, and a heart rate of 97 bpm. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and requires respiratory support. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a DNR code status and is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's presentation with substernal chest pain and atrial fibrillation suggests possible cardiac issues. The elevated troponin T level indicates myocardial injury, which may indicate a potential cardiac complication.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and previous administration of piperacillin/tazobactam suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient requires respiratory support, which indicates respiratory distress or failure. Monitoring and managing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, and multiple abdominal surgeries, admitted for upper GI bleed from anastomosis site with microperforation of bowel. The patient developed crushing chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, with heart rate in the 170s and ST depressions in V1-V6, II, F. Serial cardiac enzymes, daily EKGs, and keeping heart rate below 100 with amiodarone, prn lopressor are recommended. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, upper extremity clots, microperforation of bowel, anemia, and cirrhosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Myocardial ischemia or infarction due to demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia.
2. Stroke due to atrial fibrillation.
3. Pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremities.
4. Further gastrointestinal bleeding from the anastomosis site or other sources.
5. Infection due to prolonged use of central lines and immobility.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
7. Development of hepatocellular carcinoma given the extensive clot burden.
8. Malnutrition due to prolonged NPO status and difficulty tolerating oral intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's previous clot burden and current symptoms of chest pain increase his risk for PE. Empirical anticoagulation is planned due to the high risk of PE and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain and ECG changes suggest a possible cardiac event. Enzyme trends will be monitored, and a cardiology consult may be necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of EtOH cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status or neurological symptoms.
4. Infection: Given the patient's microperforation of the stomach and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Bleeding: The patient is at increased risk for bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and aspirin allergy.
6. Cardiac arrhythm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a known upper extremity clot burden. He presented with pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). A superior vena cava (SVC) filter was placed, and he was initially concerned for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but his enzymes were flat, and the ECG changes appeared to be rate-related.

The patient's past medical history is complicated by the presence of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He is currently experiencing chest pain, which is likely due to the combined effects of a small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). Due to his aspirin allergy, he is not receiving antiplatelet therapy.

The plan moving forward includes optimizing rate control and medical management for what is likely to be at least in part coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's cardiac enzymes will be trended, and he will be started on a beta-blocker, statin, and continue with digoxin for rate control.

In terms of bowel perfusion, the patient's microperf is being followed by surgery, and he will start receiving oral intake slowly. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and a previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He presented with pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequently had a superior vena cava (SVC) filter placed. Although initially concerned for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), his enzymes were flat, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) changes appeared to be rate-related.

The patient has multiple indications for long-term anticoagulation, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PE, and paroxysmal AFib. It was decided to defer anticoagulation for now, with plans to start it on [**11-5**] (2 weeks after the bleed). Rate control and medical management for possible coronary artery disease (CAD) will be continued. The patient's cardiac enzymes will be finished, beta-blockers, statins, and rate control with metoprolol will be initiated, and digoxin will be continued. A follow-up ECG is planned for today.

The patient also requires bowel perfusion, which will be managed by surgery. The plan is to start oral intake slowly. In the ICU, the patient will receive regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and a prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (P"

   whose hx is complicated by the presence of GI bleed. He was found to
   have small sub seg PE and had a SVC filter placed. Although initially
   concerned for ACS, his enzymes were flat and his ECG changes appear to
   be rate related.
    >Chest pain: likely [**1-11**] combined effects of small PE as well as rate
   related Afib with RVR leading to demand. For now we are deferring
   anti-coagulation, after discussion with GI they feel it would be
   reasonable to attempt long term anti coag on [**11-5**] (2 weeks after
   bleed), he has multiple indications for long term anti coag including
   DVT, PE and paroxysmal Afib. We will cont to optimize rate control and
   medical management for what is likely to be at least in some part CAD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a recent episode on the floor with pleuritic chest pain. He has a known upper extremity clot burden and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) with a superior vena cava (SVC) filter placed. Initially concerned for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), his enzymes were flat and his electrocardiogram (ECG) changes appeared to be rate-related. The patient's allergies include aspirin, and he has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He is currently receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, furosemide, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and others. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/56 to 153/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. He has been receiving fluid resuscitation and has received blood products. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. Physical examination reveals poor dentition, crackles in the bases bilaterally, and decreased bowel sounds. Laboratory tests show"

   Chest pain: there is a pleuritic chest pain component but also an
   underlying demand component in the setting of A-fib with RVR. His
   previous clot burden puts him at increased risk for PE. We will need to
   empirically anti-coag him despite the increased risk of bleeding given
   that he is at high risk for PE and ACS. We will anti-coagulate with
   plan to image PE protocol CT. Would rate control with metoprolol
   - PE protocol CT scan
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - beta blocker, hold ASA given aspirin allergy, statin
   - rate control with metoprolol
   - cont digoxin.
   - Hold on IV Heparin given the the multiple episodes of GIB and the
   recent GIB requiring ICU admission. We will consult IR stat for
   placement of an SVC filter in the presence of documented PE.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and previous episodes of blood clots. He presented with chest pain, which includes pleuritic and underlying demand components. He has an increased risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and requires aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of blood clots, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and pleuritic chest pain raise the concern for PE. Empirical anticoagulation has been initiated, and a CT scan of the chest is planned to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain, along with his risk factors, may indicate ACS. Trending cardiac enzymes and beta-blocker therapy have been initiated to manage this condition.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has had multiple episodes of GIB, which necessitates holding on IV Heparin due to the increased risk of bleeding. Consultation for an inferior vena cava (SVC) filter placement has been requested in the presence of documented PE.
4. Poor glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale has been ordered for glycemic control, indicating the need to monitor and manage the"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo with hx of EtOH cirrhosis, Afib with RVR with an episode on the
   floor and pleuritic chest pain with known upper extremity clot burden
   whose hx is complicated by the presence of GI bleed. He was found to
   have small sub seg PE and had a SVC filter placed. Although initially
   concerned for ACS, his enzymes were flat and his ECG changes appear to
   be rate related.
    >Chest pain: likely [**1-11**] combined effects of small PE as well as rate
   related Afib with RVR leading to demand. For now we are deferring
   anti-coagulation, after discussion with GI they feel it would be
   reasonable to attempt long term anti coag on [**11-5**] (2 weeks after
   bleed), he has multiple indications for long term anti coag including
   DVT, PE and paroxysmal Afib. We will cont to optimize rate control and
   medical management for what is likely to be at least in some part CAD.
   - finish 24h cardiac enzymes
   - beta blocker, hold ASA given aspirin allergy, statin
   - rate control with metoprolol
   - cont digoxin.
   - F/u ECG today

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He presented with pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and a superior vena cava (SVC) filter placed. His initial concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was ruled out due to flat enzymes and rate-related ECG changes. The patient's chest pain is likely attributed to the combined effects of the small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation. Anti-coagulation is being deferred for two weeks after the gastrointestinal bleed, but long-term anti-coagulation will be considered given his multiple indications including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PE, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac enzymes will be monitored, and rate control and medical management for possible coronary artery disease (CAD) will continue. Bowel perfusion will be optimized prior to surgery, and plans for slow initiation of oral intake will be made. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed will be re-evaluated, and he will be transferred to the floor with a code status of full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with
   microperforation of bowel admitted with chest pain in setting of a. fib
   with RVR.
   1.  Chest pain.  Patient developed crushing SSCP in setting of A. fib
   with RVR with HR in 170s.  ST depressions in V1-V6, II, F.    Normal
   Ech on [**2172-10-22**].  Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia.
   High suspicion for cardiac chest pain.
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - daily EKGs
   - keep HR < 70 with digoxin, standing and prn lopressor
   - nitroglycerin prn SSCP
   - initiate lopressor 12.5 PO BID and uptitrate to keep rate in 70s or
   less
   - start simvastatin
   - consider cards consult if he rules in
   - NPO
   2.  A. fib.  Patient has episode of A. fib with RVR.  Precipitant
   remains unclear though high suspicion for PE given that he has a
   pleuritic element and known significant upper extremity clot burden.
   (Of note, patient has old IVC filter in place).  Has been off HSQ
   during hospital stay due to GIB.  Not on aspirin due to aspirin
   allergy.   Has been getting IVF for NPO status on floor, so less likely
   to be dehydrated.
   - continue digoxin
   - initiate lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - prn IV lopressor
   - CTA to rule out PE
   - monitor on tele
   3.  UGIB.  Bleeding source may be friability at anastamosis site from
   prior bilroth surgery.  Hct stable.  Now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.  No
   transfusiosn since [**2172-10-23**].  Anticoagulation for PE or ACS will be
   challenging given GI bleed.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - surgery following
 conservative management
   - Daily hcts, but switch to TID hcts if patient gets anticoagulated
   (pending CTA results)
   - liver following
   - NPO
   .
   4.  Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving, but will continue NPO for now. There was
   discussion about doing TPN given that patient has been NPO for several
   days.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          NPO for now, consider TPN tomorrow
   .
   5.        B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.
   -hold on anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed, however, may get
   anticoagulated pending results of PE CT
   - IR consult for possible SVC filter
   - outpatient age appropriate cancer screening
   6.  Abdominal pain.  Patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to
   pancreatitis, but with concern for microperforation as above.
   - surgery following.
   - NPO for today
   - minimize opioids
   ..
   7. Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver following
   - Collateral information if any, ?need to repeat any workup re:
   etiology
   .
   8.  Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Chest pain and suspected ischemia: The patient developed crushing substernal chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), with heart rates in the 170s. There were also ST depressions in V1-V6, II, and F leads on the EKG. Although an echocardiogram on [**2172-10-22**] was normal, there is a high suspicion for cardiac chest pain. Serial cardiac enzymes should be monitored, along with daily EKGs. The patient should be kept on digoxin to control heart rate, and prn nitroglycerin and lopressor should be used as needed. A cardiology consult may be considered if ischemia is confirmed.

2. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient had an episode of Afib with RVR. The precipitant is unclear, but a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) exists due to the pleuritic element and known significant upper extremity clot burden. The patient has an old inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. Digoxin should be continued, and lopressor 12.5 should be initiated. A CT angiogram (CTA) should be done to rule out PE. Monitoring on telemetry is also recommended.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has undergone several procedures including PICC line placement, central venous thrombus filter placement, and exchange for a neater peripheral port. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate in the high 40s, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal small subsegmental bilateral pulmonary embolisms and peripheral parenchymal opacities of unclear etiology. The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of DVT with small subsegmental bilateral pulmonary embolisms. This condition can lead to complications such as worsening pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and post-thrombotic syndrome.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF with rapid ventricular response. This condition can lead to"

   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with
   microperforation of bowel admitted with chest pain in setting of a. fib
   with RVR  and found to have b/l subsegmental PEs.
   1.  PE.  Patient found to have bilateral subsegmental PEs.  SVC filter
   placed today due to known b/l upper extremity thrombus. Pleuritic chest
   pain likely due to showering of peripheral thrombi.  Cannot get
   anticoagulated due to recurrent GI bleeds, but would consider if stable
   over two weeks.
   - SVC and IVC filter in place
   - no anticoagulation for now
   2.  Chest pain.  Patient developed crushing SSCP in setting of A. fib
   with RVR with HR in 170s with st depressions on EKG.  Cardiac enzymes
   negative.  Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia.
   - daily EKGs
   - keep HR < 70 with digoxin, standing and lopressor
   - nitroglycerin prn SSCP
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - continue simvastatin
   3.  A. fib.  Patient has episode of A. fib with RVR perhaps triggered
   by PE.  Now well rate controlled in 60s after intiation of lopressor.
   - continue digoxin
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - monitor on tele
   - no anticoagulation given GIB
   3.  UGIB.  Bleeding source may be friability at anastamosis site from
   prior bilroth surgery.  Hct stable.  Now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.  No
   transfusiosn since [**2172-10-23**].
   -PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - surgery following
 conservative management
   - Daily hcts
   - liver following
   - NPO
   .
   4.  Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving so will advance to clear diet.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          Advance diet to clears
   -          Continue fluconazole/zosyn but will need to discuss course
   with surgery
   .
   5.        B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.
   -hold on anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed,
   - SVC filter placed yesterday
   - outpatient age appropriate cancer screening
   6.  Abdominal pain.  Patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to
   pancreatitis, but with concern for microperforation as above.
   - surgery following.
   - clear diet
   ..
   7. Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver following
   .
   8.  Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from anastomosis site and microperforation of bowel. The patient also presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. PE: The patient has bilateral subsegmental PEs, which could lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, infarction of lung tissue, or even death if not managed appropriately.

2. SVC filter placement: The patient had a superior vena cava (SVC) filter placed due to known bilateral upper extremity thrombus. This could potentially cause local complications such as SVC syndrome or filter fracture.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding from the anastomosis site, which could result in significant blood loss leading to hypotension, shock, and organ failure if not managed promptly.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has episodes of AF with RVR, which increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications. Rate control measures need to be implemented to reduce these risks.

5. Chest pain: The patient developed crushing supraventricular"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a known upper extremity clot burden. He has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). A superior vena cava (SVC) filter was placed. The patient's chest pain is likely due to the combined effects of the small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation is being deferred for now, but it may be attempted long-term after a 2-week period following the bleed. The patient has multiple indications for long-term anticoagulation, including DVT, PE, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/63 mmHg to 172/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,568 mL, including 375 mL of intravenous fluids, 780 mL of oral intake, and 1,788 mL of intravenous fluids with an output of 1,115 mL of urine and 965 mL of blood products. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), and a known upper extremity clot burden. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pleuritic chest pain and a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has a superior vena cava (SVC) filter in place due to a previous episode of pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/63 to 172/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with poor dentition and icteric conjunctivae. He has crackles in his chest and trace edema in both lower extremities. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, he is alert and oriented, with purposeful movements and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL. The patient's plate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and known upper extremity clot burden. He has experienced pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). A superior vena cava (SVC) filter was placed, and although initially concerned for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), his enzymes were flat, and ECG changes appear to be rate-related. The patient's chest pain is likely due to the combined effects of small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, it is important to monitor for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or progression to ACS.
2. Pulmonary complications: The presence of small subsegmental PE indicates potential pulmonary complications. Monitoring for worsening respiratory status or development of new pulmonary emboli is essential.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may recur if not properly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and serial laboratory tests, including coagulation profiles, is necessary.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Adequate infection control measures and surveillance should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with
   microperforation of bowel admitted with chest pain in setting of a. fib
   with RVR  and found to have b/l subsegmental PEs.
   1.  PE.  Patient found to have bilateral subsegmental PEs.  SVC filter
   placed today due to known b/l upper extremity thrombus. Pleuritic chest
   pain likely due to showering of peripheral thrombi.  Cannot get
   anticoagulated due to recurrent GI bleeds, but would consider if stable
   over two weeks.
   - SVC and IVC filter in place
   - no anticoagulation for now
   2.  Chest pain.  Patient developed crushing SSCP in setting of A. fib
   with RVR with HR in 170s with st depressions on EKG.  Cardiac enzymes
   negative.  Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia.
   - daily EKGs
   - keep HR < 70 with digoxin, standing and lopressor
   - nitroglycerin prn SSCP
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - continue simvastatin
   3.  A. fib.  Patient has episode of A. fib with RVR perhaps triggered
   by PE.  Now well rate controlled in 60s after intiation of lopressor.
   - continue digoxin
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - monitor on tele
   - no anticoagulation given GIB
   3.  UGIB.  Bleeding source may be friability at anastamosis site from
   prior bilroth surgery.  Hct stable.  Now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.  No
   transfusiosn since [**2172-10-23**].
   -PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - surgery following
 conservative management
   - Daily hcts
   - liver following
   - NPO
   .
   4.  Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving so will advance to clear diet.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          Advance diet to clears
   -          Continue fluconazole/zosyn but will need to discuss course
   with surgery
   5.        B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.
   -hold on anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed,
   - SVC filter placed yesterday
   - outpatient age appropriate cancer screening
   6.  Abdominal pain.  Patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to
   pancreatitis, but with concern for microperforation as above.
   - surgery following.
   - clear diet
   7. Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver following
   8.  Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from anastomosis site and microperforation of bowel. The patient also presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and right ventricular overload (RVR), and he was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs). An inferior vena cava (SVC) filter was placed due to known bilateral upper extremity thrombus. Pleuritic chest pain is likely due to showering of peripheral thrombi. The patient cannot be anticoagulated at present due to recurrent GI bleeds, but anticoagulation may be considered if stable over two weeks.

Additionally, the patient developed crushing sternal syndrome post-infarct (SSCP) in the setting of AFib with RVR, with a heart rate in the 170s and st depressions on EKG. Cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating likely demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled in the 60s after initiation of lopressor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from an anastomosis site and microperforation of the bowel. The patient also experienced chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation and was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs). A superior vena cava (SVC) filter has been placed, and no anticoagulation is currently being administered due to recurrent GI bleeds.

The patient's cardiovascular symptoms, including chest pain and irregular rhythm, have resolved, but he still has an irregular rhythm with a heart rate in the 90s. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, and he is oxygenating well at 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has maroon stools and a drop in hematocrit (Hct), indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. He has not received transfusions since October 23rd and October 28th. Prophylactic medications are being administered for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count (Plt), and normal liver function tests (LFTs). His blood glucose levels are within normal limits, and his electrolytes are stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo with hx of EtOH cirrhosis, Afib with RVR with an episode on the
   floor and pleuritic chest pain with known upper extremity clot burden
   whose hx is complicated by the presence of GI bleed. He was found to
   have small sub seg PE and had a SVC filter placed. Although initially
   concerned for ACS, his enzymes were flat and his ECG changes appear to
   be rate related. He had repeat endoscopy on [**10-29**] which revealed no
   additional bleeding.
   >Chest pain: likely [**1-11**] combined effects of small PE as well as rate
   related Afib with RVR leading to demand. For now we are deferring
   anti-coagulation, after discussion with GI they feel it would be
   reasonable to attempt long term anti coag on [**11-5**] (2 weeks after
   bleed), he has multiple indications for long term anti coag including
   DVT, PE and paroxysmal Afib. For now he has SVC and IVC filte but in a
   few weeks will need to re-consider the question of anti-coagulation
   targeting INR 1.8.  We will cont to optimize rate control and medical
   management for what is likely to be at least in some part CAD.
   - beta blocker, hold ASA given aspirin allergy, statin
   - rate control with metoprolol
   - cont digoxin.
   >Afib/VT:run of VT this AM will cont to optimize electrolytes Mg/K and
   rate/ryth control with digox and metop
   >Bowel Perf: micro perf being followed by surgery, we will start PO
   slowly. We have stopped Abx [**10-30**].
    > GI bleed: Hct stable, he did have a dark maroon stool (not bright
   red)[**10-29**]. His Hct fluctuated b/w 26 and 29. Repat endoscopy11/20
   revealed no additional bleeding and his Hct has been stable . Notably
   he had a normal gastrin level.  GI is discussing timing of potential
   colonoscopy

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a known upper extremity clot burden. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and had a superior vena cava (SVC) filter placed. The patient's initial concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was ruled out due to flat enzymes and ECG changes that appear to be rate-related. The patient underwent repeat endoscopy on [**10-29**], which revealed no additional bleeding. The patient's chest pain is likely attributed to the combined effects of small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Anticoagulation therapy has been deferred, with plans to attempt long-term anticoagulation on [**11-5**] (two weeks after the bleed). The patient has multiple indications for long-term anticoagulation, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PE, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient currently has SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in place but will need to reconsider the question of anticoagulation in a few weeks. Rate control and medical management for what is likely to be at least in part coronary artery disease (CAD) will continue, including beta-blocker therapy, holding aspirin due to an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and known upper extremity clot burden. He presented with pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). A superior vena cava (SVC) filter was placed, and he also had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient's enzymes were flat, and his ECG changes appeared to be rate-related. Repeat endoscopy revealed no additional bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's chest pain may be due to the combined effects of small PE and rate-related atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but his enzymes were flat, suggesting it is less likely. However, optimization of rate control and medical management for what is likely to be at least in some part coronary artery disease (CAD) should be continued.

2. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has multiple indications for long-term anticoagulation, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PE, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He currently has SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in place. In a few weeks, he will need to reconsider the question of anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of ethanol cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from an anastomosis site, along with microperforation of the bowel. The patient also presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has bilateral subsegmental PEs, and there is a concern for further clot formation due to immobility and underlying conditions. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary, but it poses a risk of recurrent GI bleeding. Consideration should be given to future anticoagulation options.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is still in AFib, with a heart rate in the 90s, and occasional bradycardia in the 40s at night. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of digoxin and lopressor are recommended. Nitroglycerin should be available for chest pain as needed.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has ongoing maroon stool with oscillating hemoglobin levels, indicating ongoing blood loss. Repeat endoscopy has been performed, and PPI therapy is ongoing. Conservative management will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed from anastomosis site and microperforation of bowel. He also presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Recurrent GI bleeds: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and has experienced recurrent bleeds in the past. This is a significant concern as it can lead to further blood loss and potential shock.

2. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation in the heart and subsequently lead to stroke or other cardiac complications. The presence of RVR suggests uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, which may require further intervention.

3. Pulmonary embolisms: The patient has bilateral subsegmental PEs, indicating blood clots in the pulmonary arteries. This can lead to impaired oxygenation, respiratory distress, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.

4. Infection: The patient is receiving fluconazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), suggesting the presence of an infection. This could be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation and chest pain. The patient underwent an endoscopy to assess gastrointestinal bleeding, with no varices identified. The hct trend increased from 26.9 to 29. The patient has multiple allergies, including aspirin. The patient received fluconazole and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 36.9°C, current temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/88 to 147/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///22/. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, absent peripheral pulses in both extremities, and muscle wasting. Neurologic examination is incomplete.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results include elevated troponin T, amylase, and lactic acid levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan include chest pain, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pain control, electrolyte and"

   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with
   microperforation of bowel admitted with chest pain in setting of a. fib
   with RVR  and found to have b/l subsegmental PEs.
   1.  PE/clots
 bil subsegmental PEs, +svc filter (and ivc filter) in
   place,  no anticoagulation right now due to recurrent GI bleeds, to be
   considered for future.
   - no anticoagulation for now, should be on in future (given bilat UE
   clotting, history of LE DVT, Afib)
   - outpt cancer screening
   2.  Cardiovascular/chest pain/afib
 now resolved, still in Afib in
   90s, brady (to 40s at times, asymptomatic) at night, CEs negative.
   - cont digoxin, lopressor 37.5 daily in AM, decrease to 25 in PM,
   adjust prn.
   - nitroglycerin prn SSCP
   - continue simvastatin
   - Intermittent NSVT; check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and maximize.
   3.  UGIB
 no transfusions since [**10-23**], [**10-28**] maroon stool with
   oscillating hct.  Repeat EGD [**10-29**] as above.
   -  PPI 40mg
   - surgery following
 conservative management
   - possible colonoscopy this admission, will f/u with liver team.
   4.  mesentery air - concern for [**Last Name (LF) 2332**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] surgery, perhaps
   related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  Abd exam stable.
   - appreciate surgery recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from anastomosis site and microperforation of the bowel. The patient also experienced chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs).

The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and no anticoagulation is currently being administered due to recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds. However, consideration is being given to future anticoagulation due to the patient's history of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, and bilateral upper extremity clotting.

The patient's cardiovascular status, including chest pain and atrial fibrillation, is now resolved, but he remains in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 90s. His blood pressure fluctuates between 135/88 mmHg and 147/88 mmHg. The patient experiences bradycardia at times, particularly at night, and has had negative cardiac enzymes (CEs).

Regarding the upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient has not required transfusions since October 23rd and has been experiencing maroon stools with oscillating hematocrit levels. A repeat esophagogastro"
