","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, heart failure, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition has not improved despite receiving aggressive treatment, including multiple diuretics and albumin infusion. The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing when lying flat, resulting in low oxygen saturation levels. The patient also exhibits delirium and has expressed a desire to be made comfortable and ""let go."" The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving IV fluids, Lasix, and other medications. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and is receiving supplemental oxygen. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high blood glucose level, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has been on a PICC line since January 27th and blood cultures have been taken. The patient's condition is complicated by Clostridium difficile infection, impaired skin integrity, and chronic heart failure. The patient has been placed on DNR/DNI status and is currently receiving nutrition through TPN without lipids. The patient's family has been informed of the situation, and the patient's wishes to be made comfortable and allowed to pass away have been respected.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo male dCHF, CAD s/p CABG, afib, CKD4, coagulopathy (factor V
   inhibitor) who has had a protracted hospital course and is now being
   transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and concern for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   # Altered Mental Status: patient was initially found significantly
   somnolent, almost obtunded and responding only to sternal rub. He was
   initially found to be markedly hypoxic when his oxygen was taken off.
   Possible causes include hypoxia, hypercarbia, infection, uremia or
   ICH.  His mental status has improved throughout the morning without any
   intervention except replacing his O2.  Hypernatremia may also be
   contributing as well
   - will repeat ABG, if still significantly hypercarbic, can consider
   placement on BiPAP to help correct the hypercarbia partially, though he
   is DNI
   - will check UA/culture and blood culture for r/o infection
   - family does not want to pursue HD; can attempt to continue diuresis
   gently given his effusions, though he appears intravascularly volume
   deplete at this time.
   - continue nasal cannula- maintain O2>95%
   - will hold off on CT head currently; no focal neuro deficits noted on
   exam and mental status has improved.
   - will give 1L D5W over 10 hrs with repeat Na check this evening
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: patient with significant edema,
   pleural effusions, but possibly intravascularly volume deplete.
   - will give furosemide 40 mg IV BID for goal -500cc/-1L; will start
   albumumin 25 gm Q8H to help with diuresis as well.  Also will add
   metalozone
   - per cards, can consider cardiac CT looking for restrictive process,
   though not necessarily indicated at this time
   # Coagulopathy: based on labs from OSH, likely have Factor V
   inhibitor.  Epistaxis now resolved.  Patient being followed by
   hematology here, repeat Factor V inhibitor pending.  No clear reason
   why patient should have developed this- usually associated with surgery
   (particuarly cardiac) but patient's CABG was >6 months ago.  Also,
   associated with underlying malignancy as well, though no clear
   malignancy at this time.
   - f/u  heme recs
   - will continue to give Vitamin K for goal INR<2 though unlikely to
   make any benefit given the reason for his coagulopathy.
   # Hypoxia: persistent O2 requirement, likely component of pleural
   effusion vs volume overload.  No obvious PNA on CXR.  although PE is
   possible, with patient's elevated INR this is unlikely and we could not
   anticoagulate anyway
   - continue diuresis as above
   - maintain nasal cannula for sat >95%
   # Epistaxis: stable.  ENT has signed off
   # Paroxsymal Afib: currently rate controlled.  not on anticoagulation
   given coagulatopathy
   - cont metoprolol and diltiazem at current dose for rate control
   # C.Diff: C-diff positive at OSH. Diarrhea appears to have improved.
   - cont PO vanco 250 for 2wks after d/c of cefazolin (last day [**2-6**])
   - cont metamucil for bulking
   # CAD: Hx of CABG, no evidence of active issue
   - cont lipitor, BB.
   - holding ASA in setting of epistaxis.

   given his coagulopathy and difficulty correcting with FFP
   -continue BiPAP for now

   -likely in setting of hypercarbia which is likely exacerbated by ativan
   administration. Delirium likely a component
   -avoid opiates and benzodiazepines unless patient is made CMO
   -receiving vitamin supplementation
   #severe diastolic CHF
   -will need aggressive diuresis but we are having difficulty using
   diuretics given his acute on chronic renal failure
   -inotropes not useful in the setting of diastolic heart failure
   -will discuss with renal if we are able to ultrafiltrate through
   peripheral large bore access
   -continue diltiazem and metoprolol

   4)       Pleural Effusions
   Disussion/Plan: I had a long discussion with family today about current
   condition and options for treatment.  In short, I believe that
   medically we could attempt hemodialysis and also thoracentesis to see
   if that will reverse the respiratory decompensation while maintaining
   patient on bipap.  The family has already discussed code status that is
   DNR/DNI and do not wish that to change.  Moreover, after discussing the
   next medical options and considering his long and steady decline since
   last summer with recurrent infections, worsening nutrition, and
   multiple organ injury, they would like to pursue a pathway of comfort
   care and related they believe the patient would want this path if he
   were able to make his own decision.  We will not escalate care and the
   patient
s daughter is arriving tomorrow so we will continue bipap for
   now.  After the daughter arrives, will move toward comfort care.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old man with a complex medical history, including CABG, acquired factor V deficiency, severe diastolic CHF, recurrent infections, malnutrition, and C. difficile colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure while receiving Ativan.

The patient's current condition shows worsening hypercarbia, more somnolent, and unable to diurese despite lasix drip, diuril, and metolazone. His vital signs indicate a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range. He is on BiPAP for respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases, right and left lower extremity edema, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan include worsening hypercarbia, altered mental status, severe diastolic CHF, acute on chronic renal failure, acquired factor V deficiency, malnutrition, and C. difficile colitis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family prefers comfort care rather than aggressive treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, renal failure, heart failure, and pleural effusions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of CABG, acquired factor V deficiency, severe diastolic CHF, recurrent infections, malnutrition, and C. difficile colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure while receiving Ativan. The patient has been on various medications including furosemide, metolazone, diltiazem, and metoprolol. He also received FFP and Vitamin K due to acquired factor V deficiency. The patient is on TPN for malnutrition and oral vancomycin for C. difficile colitis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds at the bases, right and left lower extremity edema, and he is alert and oriented. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his ABG results indicate a low pH level. This suggests inadequate ventilation and carbon dioxide retention. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery and ventilation support may be necessary.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated, and there are signs of fluid overload. Diuretics (such as lasix and"

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), acquired factor V deficiency, severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recurrent infections, malnutrition, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure while receiving Ativan. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening hypercarbia and altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is unable to effectively remove carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to increased levels of CO2 in the blood. This can cause respiratory acidosis and may lead to further complications such as hypoxemia and respiratory arrest if not addressed promptly.

2. Severe diastolic CHF: The patient's heart failure is impacting his ability to effectively pump blood, leading to fluid buildup and congestion in the body. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products and toxins in the body. This can further compromise his overall health and increase the risk of other complications.

4. Acquired factor V deficiency: The patient has a deficiency in factor V, a clotting factor necessary for normal blood clotting. This increases the risk of bleeding and can"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo male dCHF, CAD s/p CABG, afib, CKD4, coagulopathy (factor V
   inhibitor) who has had a protracted hospital course and is now being
   transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and concern for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   # Altered Mental Status: patient was initially found significantly
   somnolent, almost obtunded and responding only to sternal rub. He was
   initially found to be markedly hypoxic when his oxygen was taken off.
   Possible causes include hypoxia, hypercarbia, infection, uremia or
   ICH.  His mental status has improved throughout the morning without any
   intervention except replacing his O2.  Hypernatremia may also be
   contributing as well
   - will repeat ABG, if still significantly hypercarbic, can consider
   placement on BiPAP to help correct the hypercarbia partially, though he
   is DNI
   - will check UA/culture and blood culture for r/o infection
   - family does not want to pursue HD; can attempt to continue diuresis
   gently given his effusions, though he appears intravascularly volume
   deplete at this time.
   - continue nasal cannula- maintain O2>95%
   - will hold off on CT head currently; no focal neuro deficits noted on
   exam and mental status has improved.
   - will give 1L D5W over 10 hrs with repeat Na check this evening
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: patient with significant edema,
   pleural effusions, but possibly intravascularly volume deplete.
   - will give furosemide 40 mg IV BID for goal -500cc/-1L; will start
   albumumin 25 gm Q8H to help with diuresis as well.  Also will add
   metalozone
   - per cards, can consider cardiac CT looking for restrictive process,
   though not necessarily indicated at this time
   # Coagulopathy: based on labs from OSH, likely have Factor V
   inhibitor.  Epistaxis now resolved.  Patient being followed by
   hematology here, repeat Factor V inhibitor pending.  No clear reason
   why patient should have developed this- usually associated with surgery
   (particuarly cardiac) but patient's CABG was >6 months ago.  Also,
   associated with underlying malignancy as well, though no clear
   malignancy at this time.
   - f/u  heme recs
   - will continue to give Vitamin K for goal INR<2 though unlikely to
   make any benefit given the reason for his coagulopathy.
   # Hypoxia: persistent O2 requirement, likely component of pleural
   effusion vs volume overload.  No obvious PNA on CXR.  although PE is
   possible, with patient's elevated INR this is unlikely and we could not
   anticoagulate anyway
   - continue diuresis as above
   - maintain nasal cannula for sat >95%
   # Epistaxis: stable.  ENT has signed off
   # Paroxsymal Afib: currently rate controlled.  not on anticoagulation
   given coagulatopathy
   - cont metoprolol and diltiazem at current dose for rate control
   # C.Diff: C-diff positive at OSH. Diarrhea appears to have improved.
   - cont PO vanco 250 for 2wks after d/c of cefazolin (last day [**2-6**])
   - cont metamucil for bulking
   # CAD: Hx of CABG, no evidence of active issue
   - cont lipitor, BB.
   - holding ASA in setting of epistaxis.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, and coagulopathy due to a factor V inhibitor. The patient was initially found to be significantly somnolent and hypoxic, but his mental status has improved without intervention. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation using BiPAP and is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/64 to 77/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F). His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for altered mental status.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,085 mL with output of 347 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,738 mL. He is receiving TPN and has been transitioned to oral medications if possible. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased potassium and sodium levels. His blood gases show a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.27.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular abnormalities, and his neurologic examination is not assessed"

s family discussed wanting patient to be CMO.
   Awaiting for daughter to return from out of the country.  Will use
   BiPAP and levophed as bridge until then
   - can try morphine 0.5 mg IV PRN for respiratory distress

   no response to diuretics.
   - minimize fluid in; stopped TPN
   - no further diuretics
   # Hypotension: patient
s BP low overnight; VBG without worsening
   acidosis last night.  Possibly septic physiology from ? PNA vs UTI
   - started on levophed overnight to maintain MAP >55 while awaiting for
   daughter to arrive
   - no IVFs
   # Coagulopathy: likely has Factor V inhibitor.  Epistaxis now

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, and coagulopathy due to factor V inhibitor. The patient has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and is now admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for altered mental status and concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's family wishes to pursue comfort measures only (CMO), but they want to maintain a holding pattern until their daughter can arrive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) and has a history of acute respiratory failure, which may progress to require mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is significantly volume overloaded, indicating poor cardiac function. This could lead to worsening of heart failure symptoms and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is ongoing concern for septic physiology. If not managed appropriately, hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a factor V inhibitor, which increases the risk of bleeding. Any invasive procedures or trauma could exacerbate this condition.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's persistent oxygen requirement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old man with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic malnutrition, anuric renal failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure while receiving Ativan.
- The patient's daughter is expected to arrive at 4 PM, after which the plan is to transition to comfort care.
- Current treatments include BiPAP, levophed, antibiotics, tube feeds, and morphine as needed.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%.
- The patient has a history of CABG, acquired factor V deficiency, recurrent infections, malnutrition, and C. difficile colitis.
- Physical examination reveals cachectic appearance, dullness at the lung bases, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and attentive mental status.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, albuterol/atrovent nebs, atorvastatin, citalopram, thiamine, albumin, vitamin C, levaquin, and vitamin K.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is in the ICU.
- The attending physician agrees with the assessment and plan, with modifications regarding blood pressure management and anticipation of the patient's daughter's arrival.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, and his condition may worsen without appropriate respiratory support.
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, requiring vasopressor support, indicating a possible state of shock.
3. Malnutrition: The patient has chronic malnutrition, which can contribute to poor wound healing, decreased immune function, and impaired recovery.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient is not producing urine, indicating renal failure. This can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid accumulation, and metabolic disturbances.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent infections, and he is currently receiving antibiotics. Infections can complicate his overall condition and increase the risk of sepsis."

The patient requires BiPAP for respiratory support and has been started on levophed for hypotension. The plan is to keep the patient alive until his daughter arrives at 4 PM, after which the plan is to transition to comfort care. A scopolamine patch has been initiated for oral secretions, and diuretics have been stopped due to refractory anuria and rising creatinine levels.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received infusions of norepinephrine at a dose of 0.01 mcg/kg/min and morphine sulfate. Other ICU medications include albuterol/atrovent nebs, vancomycin 250mg po q6hr, lopressor, diltiazem on hold, atorvastatin 80mg daily, citalopram 10mg daily, thiamine 100mg IV daily, albumin 25gm IV q8hr, vitamin C, levaquin 250mg daily, and vitamin K 5mg daily.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/64 mmHg to 77/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm. The patient's height is 60 inches, and his weight is not mentioned. His fluid balance shows an intake of 2,085 mL with outputs of 347 mL urine, 280 mL TF, 436 mL IVF, 300 mL blood products, and 5 mL drain. The patient's respiratory support includes Bipap mask, CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, cachectic appearance with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and dullness at the bases of the lungs. He has right and left lower extremity edema, soft and non-tender abdomen, and bowel sounds present. His extremities show no assessment, and his skin is also not assessed. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows commands, and states he is comfortable.

The patient's lab results show hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 219 K/uL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4."

   Assessment and Plan
   #worsening hypercarbia
   -patient did not receive any sedatives overnight
   -increase lasix drip to maximum dose, continue diuril and metolazone,
   continue SPA
   -switch all medications to oral to minimize intake
   -discuss with family a thoracentesis-which would be a risky procedure
   given his coagulopathy and difficulty correcting with FFP
   -continue BiPAP for now

   -likely in setting of hypercarbia which is likely exacerbated by ativan
   administration. Delirium likely a component
   -avoid opiates and benzodiazepines unless patient is made CMO
   -receiving vitamin supplementation
   #severe diastolic CHF
   -will need aggressive diuresis but we are having difficulty using
   diuretics given his acute on chronic renal failure
   -inotropes not useful in the setting of diastolic heart failure
   -will discuss with renal if we are able to ultrafiltrate through
   peripheral large bore access
   -continue diltiazem and metoprolol
   #acute on chronic renal failure
   -may be in setting of poor forward flow
   #acquired factor V deficiency
   -factor V levels improving
    -change Vitamin K to enteral
   #malnutrition
   -stop TPN given large fluid intake
   # C. difficile colitis

   77 yo male dCHF, CAD s/p CABG, afib, CKD4, coagulopathy (factor V
   inhibitor) who has had a protracted hospital course and is now being
   transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and concern for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   # Goals of care: patient
s family discussed wanting patient to be CMO.
   Awaiting for daughter to return from out of the country.  Will use
   BiPAP and levophed as bridge until then
   - can try morphine 0.5 mg IV PRN for respiratory distress
   - start scopalmine patch for secretions
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: significantly volume overloaded, but
   no response to diuretics.
   - minimize fluid in; stopped TPN
   - no further diuretics
   # Hypotension: patient
s BP low overnight; VBG without worsening
   acidosis last night.  Possibly septic physiology from ? PNA vs UTI
   - started on levophed overnight to maintain MAP >55 while awaiting for
   daughter to arrive
   - no IVFs
   # Coagulopathy: likely has Factor V inhibitor.  Epistaxis now
   resolved.  Patient being followed by hematology here, repeat Factor V
   inhibitor pending.  No clear reason why patient should have developed
   this- usually associated with surgery (particuarly cardiac) but
   patient's CABG was >6 months ago.  Also, associated with underlying
   malignancy as well, though no clear malignancy at this time.
   - stop vitamin K given no improvement
   # Hypoxia: persistent O2 requirement, likely component of pleural
   effusion vs volume overload.  No obvious PNA on CXR.  although PE is
   possible, with patient's elevated INR this is unlikely and we could not
   anticoagulate anyway
   - on BiPAP for hypercarbia as bridge to CMO once daughter arrives
   # Epistaxis: stable.  ENT has signed off
   # Paroxsymal Afib: holding meds at this time given lowish BP
   # C.Diff: C-diff positive at OSH. Diarrhea appears to have improved.
   - cont PO vanco 250 for 2wks after d/c of cefazolin (last day [**2-6**])
   - cont metamucil for bulking
   # CAD: Hx of CABG, no evidence of active issue
   - cont lipitor, BB.
   - holding ASA in setting of epistaxis.

   Code status: Comfort measures only
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and a coagulopathy caused by a factor V inhibitor. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course and is now being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for altered mental status and concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's family has discussed their desire for comfort measures only (CMO) and wants to maintain this status until the patient's daughter can arrive. The patient is currently on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and is being supported with vasopressor medication (levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. Diuretics have been stopped due to the patient's minimal urine output.

The patient also has a coagulopathy, which is suspected to be caused by a factor V inhibitor. Epistaxis has been resolved, and the patient is being followed by hematology with pending repeat factor V inhibitor tests. There is no clear reason for the development of this coagulopathy.

The patient requires supplemental oxygen and is likely experiencing hypercarbia, possibly due to a pleural effusion or volume overload. The patient's elevated INR makes pulmonary embolism unlikely, and anticoagulation is not feasible at this time.

Other medical issues include a resolved episode of epistaxis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo male dCHF, CAD s/p CABG, afib, CKD4, coagulopathy (factor V
   inhibitor) who has had a protracted hospital course and is now being
   transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and concern for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   # Goals of care:  Patient now CMO.  Off pressors.
   - morphine 0.5 mg IV PRN for respiratory distress
   - will start scopalmine patch for secretions
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: significantly volume overloaded, but
   no response to diuretics.
   - minimize fluid in; stopped TPN
   - no further diuretics
   # Coagulopathy: likely has Factor V inhibitor.  Epistaxis now
   resolved.  Patient being followed by hematology here, repeat Factor V
   inhibitor pending.  No clear reason why patient should have developed
   this- usually associated with surgery (particuarly cardiac) but
   patient's CABG was >6 months ago.  Also, associated with underlying
   malignancy as well, though no clear malignancy at this time.
   - stop vitamin K given no improvement
   # Hypoxia:  likely from pleural effusions/heart failure.
   - morphine for dyspnea
   # Epistaxis: stable.  ENT has signed off
   # Paroxsymal Afib: holding meds at this time given lowish BP
   # C.Diff:  No further antibx.

   Code status: Comfort measures only
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD4), and coagulopathy caused by a factor V inhibitor. He has had a prolonged hospital stay and is now being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for altered mental status and concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include discussions with the family regarding prognosis and goals of care, with the family opting for comfort measures only (CMO). The patient has been on BiPAP throughout the day with significant secretions, for which he was given morphine and a scopolamine patch overnight. His blood pressure has been low, so he was started on levophed overnight to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55. Diuretics were stopped as the patient only made about 10cc/hr despite maximum doses. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was also stopped, and all non-essential medications were transitioned to oral intake.

The patient's daughter arrived at 4 pm, and he was taken off BiPAP and pressors, and discharged. All non-essential medications were stopped, and the patient did well throughout the night.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius (97.2 Fahrenheit), a"
