","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented to the emergency department with fevers and an obstructed biliary tree. She underwent an ERCP procedure and was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and concern for sepsis. The patient's overnight events were stable, with resolution of tachycardia, fevers, and no requirement for fluid rehydration. Her blood pressure has been averaging around 100/60. She has a chronic anemia, likely due to chronic blood loss or ACD, with a hematocrit level of 21.5. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including fevers and tachycardia. While her condition has improved overnight, there is still a risk of sepsis due to the ongoing infection in her biliary tree.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. This condition requires prompt antibiotic treatment and may require further interventions such as endoscopic procedures.
3. Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia, which could be due to chronic blood loss from her colon cancer or autoimmune causes. Monitoring her hemoglobin levels and providing appropriate transfusions if necessary will be important.
4. Metastatic Colon Cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented to the emergency department with fevers and an obstructed biliary tree. She underwent ERCP and was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and concern for sepsis. Overnight, she remained stable, and her tachycardia resolved. The patient is not requiring fluid rehydration, with an average blood pressure of 100/60. Her fevers resolved with the addition of broader spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn). She has chronic anemia, with a hematocrit level of 21.5%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fevers and tachycardia, indicating a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, which resolved her fevers. However, ongoing monitoring for signs of sepsis is necessary.
2. Biliary Tree Obstruction: The patient has an obstructed biliary tree, which can lead to complications such as cholangitis or cholecystitis if not managed appropriately.
3. Chronic Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level of 21.5%, indicating chronic anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient's underlying condition is metastatic colon cancer. This may contribute to her overall vulnerability and potential complications related to her cancer.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids overnight, with a total fluid intake of 369 mL. Close monitoring of her fluid balance is necessary to prevent fluid overload.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose level is slightly elevated at 117 mg/dL. Monitoring and management of her blood sugar levels are important to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia."

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer who presents with cholangitis. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.4°C (102.9°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 128/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin, and unasyn for GNR coverage. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's physical examination findings are largely unremarkable except for the presence of cholangitis. The plan includes continuing vancomycin and starting unasyn for GNR coverage, monitoring WBC count and liver enzymes, performing serial abdominal exams, and tailoring antibiotics based on culture data. Other ongoing plans include addressing anemia, advancing diet as tolerated, managing peripheral IV access, administering heparin subcutaneously, and discussing code status with the patient's daughter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and cholangitis, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Organ Dysfunction:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma presenting with rigors, leukocytosis, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient was initially seen by an oncologist for a second opinion and then experienced rigors in the office, leading to a visit to the emergency department (ED). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Ampicillin) for presumed cholangitis. She also underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but did not show evidence of pus. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 247,000/uL, elevated hematocrit at 25.0%, and normal platelet count of 255,000/uL. Liver function tests are elevated with ALT/AST at 54/59 and alkaline phosphatase at 774 U/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is currently receiving nutrition through a tube and has well-controlled blood sugar levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma presenting with rigors, leukocytosis, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She was seen by an oncologist for a second opinion regarding treatment options and subsequently developed high fevers and rigors, indicating a likely biliary source of infection, presumed cholangitis.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but did not show evidence of pus or malignant obstruction. Since then, she has been receiving continuous antibiotics for presumed cholangitis. Her daily LFTs and white blood cell (WBC) counts are being monitored. She is also being followed for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and continues to receive antibiotics.

Regarding her metastatic colon cancer, the plan is to clarify the extent of the cancer with prior medical records and imaging studies. Consultation with Dr. [Last Name (Title)] is planned to discuss additional imaging, other necessary studies, and treatment options.

In the ICU, the patient's nutrition is being advanced as tolerated, and her blood sugar levels are well-controlled. She has two peripheral IV lines inserted on [2116-6-25] at 02:15 AM and 04:09 AM, respectively. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilator"
