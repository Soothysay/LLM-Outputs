   DISPOSITION:  ICU level of care
","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis and previous admissions for MS changes. She presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and recent admissions for MS changes. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been treated with various medications, including dopamine, morphine sulfate, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 94/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show normal T3 levels, low FT4 levels, and normal cortisol levels. The patient also has pending microbiology cultures for stool, urine, and blood.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia could be secondary to infection, adrenal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism. The patient has been recently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, raising concern for multi-drug resistant organisms. There is also concern for sepsis given the urinary tract infection and low blood pressures at admission. Serum cortisol does not suggest adrenal insufficiency. The patient has a history of being hospitalized at NWH from 05/21-12/12 and was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for sepsis. Infectious workup with cultures: blood, urine, and follow-up stool cultures should be done. Start vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin since the patient may have resistance to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. DFA to rule out flu. Surveillance blood cultures should be done.

2. Hypoglycemia: The etiology of hypoglycemia is unclear. There is a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in the chart, but the patient is not on any glycemic control medications. Q2H finger sticks should be done.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis. Infectious workup as above should be done. Prn boluses given DNI status. Continue dopamine now for goal systolic blood pressure >110. May need central line access.

4. Hypothyroidism: T4 levels are at appropriate levels, so continue home levothyroxine dose at IV dosing.

5. MS: [Name13 (STitle) 4934] baclofen 10mg TID while unable to take PO due to somnolence.

6. HTN: Hold home antihypertensives in setting of hypotension.

   DISPOSITION:  ICU level of care
","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent admissions for MS changes. She is currently in the ICU due to bradycardia, hypothermia, and other medical complications. The patient's recent events include speaking with her son, feeling dyspneic, receiving IV morphine and Lasix, and expressing fear of dying. She has no known drug allergies. Her vital signs show low blood pressure, but her heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal range. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion and other ICU medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 3,241 mL since 12 AM. Respiratory support is not required as her SpO2 is 99%. Laboratory results indicate normal thyroid hormone levels and cortisol levels, suggesting it is not adrenal insufficiency. Microbiology cultures are pending for stool, urine, and blood. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes hypothermia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and possible sepsis. The plan includes starting Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro due to potential resistance to previous antibiotics, conducting infectious workup with cultures, ruling out flu with DFA, and performing surveillance blood cultures. The patient's hypoglycemia and hypotension are also being addressed, along with her MS and other comorbidities"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and previous admissions for MS changes. She presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and recent hospitalization for sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is nonresponsive. She has multiple medical complications including hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and hypothyroidism. She is on multiple medications including dopamine, furosemide, morphine, and levothyroxine. The patient's family has chosen a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient is experiencing hypothermia, with a recorded temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F). This can lead to various complications such as decreased metabolism, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of infection.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels, which can result in confusion, weakness, seizures, and even coma if left untreated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure, decreased tissue perfusion, and shock if not promptly addressed.
4. Hypothyroidism: Although the patient's T4 levels are within the appropriate range, she is currently receiving IV levothyroxine. Thyroid hormone"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU for recent changes in her MS. She is currently experiencing bradycardia and hypothermia. The patient has been on various medications including dopamine, morphine, Lasix, and ciprofloxacin. She also has an ongoing urinary tract infection (UTI) and low blood pressure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is below normal, indicating hypothermia. This could be secondary to infection or other factors.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which may be related to her MS or an underlying condition.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels, which could be due to diabetes management or other causes.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, possibly due to sepsis or other factors.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid levels are slightly low, but her current medication dose seems appropriate.
6. Multi-drug resistant organisms: There is concern for multi-drug resistant organisms due to previous antibiotic use.
7. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including UTI and low blood pressure, raise concern for sepsis.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving D"

   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Hypotension: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Currently still
   requiring BP support with norepinephrine.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.
   - Continue sepsis treatment with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro
   - Prn boluses gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   - Continue norepi as needed, will attempt to wean today as tolerated
   -FU blood, urine cultures
   - FU Stool cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures, will order for today
   #.  Hypothermia: Could be secondary to infection as by labs does not
   appear to be adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism.  Patient recently
   on vanc/zosyn so concern for multi-drug resistant organisms.  Feel that
   most likely is urosepsis given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.
   Per notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was
   treated with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   #. Shortness of breath: Patient with some shortness of breath
   associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely an
   anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   #.  Hypoglycemia: There is a diagnosis of DM in chart, however not on
   any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have been 129-164 now and
   admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology
   - Check [**Name (NI) 3365**] fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   #.  hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with recent admissions for multiple sclerosis (MS) changes and a history of MS, presenting with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with septic shock due to urosepsis. The assessment and plan indicate the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistently low blood pressures suggest septic shock as a likely cause. The current treatment involves BP support with norepinephrine. The plan includes continuing sepsis treatment with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro, administering prn boluses for low UOP and CVP, attempting to wean norepinephrine as tolerated, and monitoring blood cultures.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature is likely secondary to infection, as there is no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. The patient was recently on vancomycin and zosyn, which raises concern for multi-drug resistant organisms. Urosepsis is considered the most likely cause, given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission. The plan involves continuing warming blanket as needed.

3. Shortness of breath: The patient experiences some shortness of breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures. This may have an anxiety component, as oxygen saturation levels remain within normal limits and improved with IV Ativan. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Hypotension: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Currently still
   requiring BP support with norepinephrine.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   - Give another 500cc NS now for blood pressure support
   - Continue sepsis treatment with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro, today is day 2,
   course pending culture data
   - Prn boluses gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   - Will attempt to wean norepinephrine today as tolerated
   -FU blood, urine cultures
   - FU Stool cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures, will order for today
   - Will get CT scan to look for source of infection in urinary tract,
   will need contrast.  Can look at CT chest as well to better
   characterize causes of hypoxia.
   - Check vanc trough this am
   #.  Hypothermia: Could be secondary to infection as by labs does not
   appear to be adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most
   likely is urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at
   admission.  Per notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**]
   and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   #. Shortness of breath: Patient with some shortness of breath
   associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely an
   anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   #.  Hypoglycemia: There is a diagnosis of DM in chart, however not on
   any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have been 129-164 now and
   admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been drug-related
   vs sepsis-related on admission.
   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   #.  MS: Hold baclofen 10mg TID while can't take PO because of
   somnolence
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].
   - Will discuss with family
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will advance diet to soft diet, prn boluses.  Will check

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with recent admissions for multiple sclerosis (MS) changes and a history of MS, presenting with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires support for low blood pressure with norepinephrine. The vital signs indicate low CVP, low urine output, and SvO2 of 79%. The patient has been given IV fluids, and a CT scan is planned to look for pyelo or other sources of infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistently low blood pressures suggest the possibility of septic shock, especially considering evidence for urosepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment with IV fluids and antibiotics are necessary.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature may be secondary to infection, as there is no indication of adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. Warming measures should be continued as needed.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath may have an anxiety component, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her hypoxia. Oxygen saturation levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to maintain adequate oxygenation.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus but is not currently on glycemic control medications. Fre"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and showing signs of shock, likely due to sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. The arterial line and multi-lumen catheter were inserted to monitor the patient's condition.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning with crackles in the chest and an abnormal chest X-ray showing effusions bilaterally. There are indications of potential complications such as pneumonia or an intraabdominal source of infection. However, the latter seems less likely given the patient's benign examination.

The patient's renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels, and there are signs of fluid overload as indicated by the edema in the lower extremities. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is a concern for hypoglycemia, which may be medication-induced or related to sepsis.

The patient's anemia is not explained by any obvious site of bleeding, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. Additionally, the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and may require a CT scan to evaluate for a perinephric abscess.

In terms of management, the patient remains on vasopressor support with levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing with the aim of achieving a central venous pressure (C"

   88 F h/o papillary thyroid ca, MS, CAD, T2DM and hypothyroidism
   admitted from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with hypoglycemia,
   hypotension, and AMS.
   Suspect septic shock likely from urinary source.  Other possible
   sources include intraabdominal, though latter less likely given benign
   exam and difficult to exclude pneumonia given abnormalities on chest
   x-ray, though continues to oxygenate well on minimal NC O2. SVO2 > 70
   and lactate remains normal suggestive of adequate O2 delivery and
   extraction .  Improving but remains on pressor support.
   Ongoing issues include:
   # Shock: likely distributive/septic, suspect from urinary source

","Summary:
The patient is a 88-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU from another facility with hypothermia, hypotension, and altered mental status. She was recently treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with vancomycin and zosyn, but cultures from that admission never became positive. The patient's current condition is improving, but she remains on pressor support due to septic shock likely from a urinary source. Other possible sources of infection include intraabdominal or pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 126/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination findings include right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and liver enzymes, but elevated creatinine and lactate levels. Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusions but no focal process on chest x-ray. Microbiology tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock likely from a urinary source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated pending culture data"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Hypotension: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Currently still
   requiring BP support with norepinephrine.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   - Give another 500cc NS now for blood pressure support
   - Continue sepsis treatment with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro, today is day 3,
   course pending culture data
   - Prn boluses gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   - Will attempt to wean norepinephrine today as tolerated
   -FU blood, urine cultures
   - FU Stool cultures
   - Check vanc level this am
   #.  Hypothermia: Could be secondary to infection as by labs does not
   appear to be adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most
   likely is urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at
   admission.  Per notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**]
   and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   #. Shortness of breath: Patient with some shortness of breath
   associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely an
   anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   #.  Hypoglycemia: There is a diagnosis of DM in chart, however not on
   any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have been 129-164 now and
   admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been drug-related
   vs sepsis-related on admission.
   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   #.  MS: Hold baclofen 10mg TID while can't take PO because of
   somnolence
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent admissions for MS changes. She is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and hypotension. The patient is experiencing bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. She has a fever and her blood cultures are pending. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and her urine cultures are also pending. The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and right ureteral and bladder wall thickening with right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter. A CT scan of her torso shows cholelithiasis. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. Her vital signs are stable with the assistance of norepinephrine. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but she has had episodes of hypoglycemia. Her thyroid hormone levels are normal, and she is being treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. The patient's MS and hypertension are being managed conservatively. Her goals of care include a discussion with a palliative care consult regarding her wishes to remain out of the hospital and leave the hospital for holidays."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Hypotension: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Currently still
   requiring BP support with norepinephrine.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors since early this am.
   CT torso showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.
   Discussed with urology and IR and decided intervention would not help.
   - Give another 500cc NS now for blood pressure support
   - Continue sepsis treatment with Vanc/Meropenem and d/c Cipro, today is
   day 3 for likely 14 day course for complicated UTI
   - eval for PICC line
   - Prn boluses with LR gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   (currently at 6)
   - attempt to keep off pressors
   -FU blood, urine cultures
   - FU Stool cultures
   - Check vanc level this pm- will likely need 1G Q24H dosing
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload
   - wait to diurese until BPs more stable
   #.  Hypothermia:Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   #.  MS: restart baclofen 10mg TID if BPS stable today
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent admissions for MS changes. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient presents with hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. She has been off pressors since early in the morning and is receiving treatment for urosepsis with Vancomycin and Meropenem. The CT torso shows hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux, and intervention is not recommended by urology and interventional radiology (IR). The patient's blood cultures are pending, while stool and urine cultures have already been done and are negative for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) and other infections. The patient's fluid overload and low urine output are being addressed, and she is being evaluated for a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Her TTE reveals mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable, and she is not hypoglycemic. Her thyroid function tests are normal, and she is already on levothyroxine. The patient's goals of care include discussing palliative care due to her wish to remain out of the hospital and leave the hospital for a holiday. In the ICU, her nutrition"

   88 F h/o papillary thyroid ca, MS, CAD, T2DM and hypothyroidism
   admitted from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with hypoglycemia,
   hypotension, and AMS.
   Presentation appears most c/w suspect septic shock likely from urinary
   source, though cx data has been unrevealing.  Clinically pt continues
   to improve from shock/sepsis standpoint, on broad antbx course for
   presumed pyelo.
   Ongoing issues include:
   # Hypotension: pressors now off sicne this am
   -monitor urine out put, cvp. Goal MAPS > 60
   # Presumed UTI/pyelo /ureteral and bladder thickening
   --cx data has been unrevealing.  Suspect she had a partially treated
   infection.  Given CT appearance and h/o MS suspect she has neurogeneic
   bladder with ineffective empyting putting her at high risk for
   recurrent UTIs. [**Month (only) 11**] have had transient bacteremia leading to septic
   shock.
   - Urology input much apprieicated.
   --continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] to complete 14 day course. Adjust vanco dosing
   given elevated level.  Will d/c cipro today.
   --will need intermittent straight cath
   --given baldder thickening, which may all be [**12-29**] inflammation, will
   send urine cytology
   # Hypoxia
   Has sig effusions in setting of fluid resus, but with minimal O2
   requirements to maintain sats and without evidence of hypercarbia to
   suggest fatigue
   --should mobilize fluids as she continues to improve, consider gentle
   diuresis down the line if she remains stable off pressors.
   # Hypoglycemia
on admit, remains euglycemic, raises concern for
   possible medication induced vs sepsis related

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU from another facility with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient is suspected to have septic shock, likely originating from a urinary source, and is currently improving.

The patient's ongoing issues include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to septic shock. Levophed has been discontinued as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is now above 60. The urine output and central venous pressure (CVP) will be monitored.

2. Presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis: The CT scan showed significant ureteral inflammation and hydro on the right kidney. Urology consultation has been obtained, and it is suspected that the patient has a longstanding reflux and ineffective emptying of the bladder, putting her at high risk for recurrent UTIs. Ciprofloxacin will be discontinued, and vancomycin will be continued for a complete 14-day course. The patient will most likely need intermittent straight catheterization.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature has improved, likely due to infection, without evidence"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.

 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors for more than 24 hours.  CT torso
   showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.   Discussed
   with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be indicated
   currently.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 4 (d/c
d Cipro)
   - plan for PICC line  today
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   - Will dose vanc now and check level in AM
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload.  LOS
   9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have improved,
   she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit from
   diuresis today.
   - can start gently diuresis today; will live lasix 10 mg IV this AM and
   reasses in PM
   .
   #.  Hypothermia: Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: restartec baclofen 10mg TID
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   .
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].
   - Will discuss with family

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who was admitted for MS changes. She presented with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and septic shock, likely due to urosepsis. She has been off pressors for more than 24 hours and continues to have low blood pressures. The patient's total body fluid overload and pulmonary edema have resulted in hypoxemia. She is currently on Vanc/Meropenem for a 14-day course of treatment for complicated UTI, and her blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient's hypothermia is stable, and she has shown improvement in her shortness of breath. Her hypoglycemia is being monitored, and she is restarting baclofen for MS. The patient's goals of care include considering a palliative care consult given her wish to remain out of the hospital and leave for the holiday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistently low blood pressures suggest ongoing intravascular volume depletion and total body fluid overload. This could lead to further hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's total body fluid overload and pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation.
3. Infection: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, there is"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.

 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors for more than 24 hours.  CT torso
   showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.   Discussed
   with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be indicated
   currently.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 4 (d/c
d Cipro)
   - plan for PICC line  today
   - Prn boluses with LR gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   (currently at 5)
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   - Check vanc level this pm- will likely need 1G Q24H dosing
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload.  LOS
   9 L positive.
   - can start gently diuresis today
   .
   #.  Hypothermia: Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: restartec baclofen 10mg TID
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   .
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].

   Disposition: ICU for now, possible callout in PM
","The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who was admitted to the ICU for changes in mental status. She presented with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The assessment and plan indicate that her hypotension is most likely due to septic shock, as evidenced by urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures. The patient has been off pressors for more than 24 hours.

The patient has several medical conditions, including chronic reflux, complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), pulmonary edema, volume overload, hypothermia, shortness of breath, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, multiple sclerosis, and hypertension. The goals of care mention considering a palliative care consult given the patient's wish to remain out of the hospital and leave for a holiday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35°C (95°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her CVP is at 5 mmHg, and she has received a total of 1,570 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 802 mL. Her WBC count is 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count is 22.6 K/uL. Her blood cultures are pending.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including vancomycin, meropenem, enoxaparin, and ativan. She also has a PICC line planned for today.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressures suggest ongoing sepsis, which could worsen if not appropriately managed.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's shortness of breath and crackles at the bases of her lungs indicate possible fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature of 35°C indicates hypothermia, which can increase the risk of further complications if not addressed.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation of 96% suggests some level of hypoxemia, which may be due to pulmonary edema or other factors.
5. Hypoglycemia: Although the patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal limits since admission, her history of diabetes and previous hypoglycemia should be monitored closely.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's T4 level is appropriate, but it is important to continue her home levothyroxine dose at IV dosing.
7. MS exacerbation: Restarting baclofen, which is used to manage MS symptoms, is essential.
8. Hypertension: Holding home antihypertensive"

   looks clinically much improved.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   # Leukopenia; WBC count has been declining since admission, but never
   had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and declinic
   platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.  Will continue
   to monitor.  Will also attempt to obtain outside labs to get baseline
   WBC count.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rising, likely secondary to contrast administration,
   with possible component of ATN from hypotension when first admitted.
   - PM lytes
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry this AM; looks like accelerated
   idioventricular rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised
   hemodynamic stability.
   - will obtain cardiology input on ECG
   - will contact outpatient cardiologist; per family, she sees
   cardiologist at [**Hospital1 966**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), who has been admitted to the ICU for MS changes, bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. She has been off pressors for more than 24 hours and is currently on a planned 14-day course of vancomycin and meropenem for complicated UTI. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed coarse breath sounds with crackles at the bases bilaterally, increased edema in all four extremities, and no murmurs on cardiac auscultation. Laboratory results show leukopenia, rising creatinine levels, low sodium levels, and low platelet count. Imaging studies show right-sided pleural effusion, unchanged left-sided pleural effusion, and no new imaging findings.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: Most likely due to septic shock with evidence of urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.
2. Hypoxemia: Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload.
3. Hypothermia: Currently stable, possibly secondary to infection or sepsis.
4. Leukopenia: WBC count declining"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.

 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors for more than 24 hours.  CT torso
   showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.   Discussed
   with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be indicated
   currently.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 4 (d/c
d Cipro)
   - plan for PICC line  today
   - Prn boluses with LR gently given DNI status for low UOP, CVP
   (currently at 6)
   - attempt to keep off pressors
   -FU blood, urine cultures
   - FU Stool cultures
   - Check vanc level this pm- will likely need 1G Q24H dosing
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload
   - wait to diurese until BPs more stable
   .
   #.  Hypothermia: Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath

   - Check QID fingersticks
   - FU Insulin and C-peptide levels
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. They have been on pressors all morning and their temperature is within normal range. The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 96%. They are currently receiving antibiotics, enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, and pain management with Tylenol. The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and previous doses of antibiotics. They are being monitored closely with arterial and multi-lumen lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's organs may continue to deteriorate due to the ongoing infection and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, indicating a potential risk for further hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Infection: Although C. diff has been negative twice, there is still a possibility of other infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as enoxaparin, are in place.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted from another facility with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient remains off pressors since yesterday morning and has been improving from a shock/sepsis standpoint. She has been on a broad antibiotic course for presumed pyelonephritis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Presumed UTI/pyelo/ureteral and bladder thickening: The patient may have a neurogenic bladder with ineffective emptying, putting her at high risk for recurrent UTIs. She will continue on Vancomycin to complete a 14-day course. Intermittent straight catheterization will be needed after Foley removal, and urology input is appreciated. Urine cytology will be sent, and repeat imaging will be necessary after treating the acute infection/inflammation.
2. Hypothermia: The patient experiences recurrent hypothermia overnight, although all other infectious parameters continue to improve. Monitoring clinical status closely, and restarting Cipro if additional signs of clinical decline occur.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count has not mounted a response and is now slowly declining. It is unclear whether this is related to medication effect (Vanco) or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The assessment suggests that the patient's presentation is consistent with septic shock, likely originating from a urinary source.

The patient has shown improvement since being admitted to the ICU and has been off pressors for a day. However, there are several ongoing issues that need to be addressed:

1. Presumed urinary tract infection (UTI)/pyelonephritis: The patient has been on a broad antibiotic course for presumed pyelo (pyelonephritis), but the culture data has been unrevealing. Given her history of MS and the possibility of a neurogenic bladder, she is at high risk for recurrent UTIs. The plan is to continue with vancomycin to complete a 14-day course and perform intermittent straight catheterization after the removal of the Foley catheter. Additionally, urine cytology will be sent due to the presence of bladder thickening.

2. Hypothermia: The patient has recurrent episodes of hypothermia, but all other infectious parameters are improving. Monitoring will continue, and if there are any additional signs of clinical decline, restarting ciprofloxacin may"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.

 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors for more than 24 hours.  CT torso
   showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.   Discussed
   with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be indicated
   currently.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 4 (d/c
d Cipro)
   - plan for PICC line  today
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   - Will dose vanc now and check level in AM
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload.  LOS
   9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have improved,
   she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit from
   diuresis today.
   - can start gently diuresis today; will live lasix 10 mg IV this AM and
   reasses in PM
   .
   #.  Hypothermia: Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be intermittently
   hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount a fever and
   this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.  However, patient
   looks clinically much improved.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   # Leukopenia; WBC count has been declining since admission, but never
   had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and declinic
   platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.  Will continue
   to monitor.  Will also attempt to obtain outside labs to get baseline
   WBC count.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rising, likely secondary to contrast administration,
   with possible component of ATN from hypotension when first admitted.
   - PM lytes
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry this AM; looks like accelerated
   idioventricular rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised
   hemodynamic stability.
   - will obtain cardiology input on ECG
   - will contact outpatient cardiologist; per family, she sees
   cardiologist at [**Hospital1 966**]
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: restart baclofen 10mg TID
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home antihyptertensives in setting of hypotension
   .
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient
s wish to remain out of the hospital and to leave the hospital
   for [**Holiday 3326**].
   - Will discuss with family

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and previous admissions for MS changes. She was admitted with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to urosepsis. She also has hypotension, which has been managed without the use of pressors for over 24 hours. Imaging showed hydronephrosis, possibly due to chronic reflux.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 33.9°C (93.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on intravenous lasix and has had an output of 600cc over the past 4 hours.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.0 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 110 mg/dL, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is low at 100 K/uL.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, enoxaparin, and furosemide. She is also on home medications for MS, hypertension,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent admissions for MS changes. She presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient is currently in the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures suggest septic shock, likely secondary to urosepsis. The CT torso showed hydronephrosis, which may be a contributing factor. The patient is still intravascularly volume depleted and has total body fluid overload. Continuous treatment with Vancomycin and Meropenem for complicated UTI is recommended.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirements have improved, but she is still total body fluid overloaded. Pulmonary edema and volume overload are likely causes of hypoxemia. Slow diuresis is advised to manage fluid overload.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is around 95 degrees Fahrenheit without the use of a warming blanket. Urosepsis-related hypothermia is suspected, and the patient should continue to be warmed as needed.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is stable, but all lines are down. This could be due to an acute infection or drug reaction. Monitoring and obtaining outside labs for baseline WBC count are recommended.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, possibly due to contrast administration and ATN from hypotension during admission. Renal dosing of medications and monitoring are advised.

6. Arrhythmia: An accelerated idioventricular rhythm was observed on telemetry but did not compromise hemodynamic stability. Cardiology does not consider it concerning, and further workup is not necessary.

7. Shortness of breath: The patient experienced shortness of breath associated with movement or procedures. Anxiety may be a contributing factor, as oxygen saturation levels remained within normal limits and improved with Ativan administration.

8. Hypoglycemia: Although the patient had hypoglycemia on admission, it has not recurred. The patient's fingerstick glucose levels have been stable between 129-164 mg/dL. The cause of hypoglycemia is unclear, and monitoring is advised.

9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's T4 levels are appropriate, so continuing home levothyroxine dose at IV dosing is recommended.

10. Multiple sclerosis (MS): Baclofen 10mg TID should be restarted for MS management.

11. Hypertension: Holding home diltiazem is advised in the setting of hypotension and diuresis.

Overall, the patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing management of sepsis, hypotension, hypoxemia, hypothermia, pancytopen"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   # Altered mental status: Likely med-effect due
 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Feel that she is still
   intravascularly volume depleted and total body fluid overloaded.
   Patient has now been off pressors for more than 24 hours.  CT torso
   showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.   Discussed
   with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be indicated
   currently.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 5 (d/c
d Cipro)
   - PICC may need to be removed, then ? permanent access for antibiotics.
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   - vanco supratherapeutic (28.0), will hold dose and recheck in PM.
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload.  LOS
   9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have improved,
   she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit from
   continued slow diuresis.
   - can start gently diuresis today; will live lasix 10 mg IV this AM and
   reasses in PM
   .
   #.  Hypothermia: Currently stable.   Could be secondary to infection as
   by labs does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or
   hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is urosepsis-related given
   recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per notes, patient was
   hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for
   sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be intermittently
   hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount a fever and
   this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.  However, patient
   looks clinically much improved.
   - continue warming blanket as needed
   .
   # Pancytopenia: WBC count stable but all lines are down.  Could be from
   acute infection.  WBC count has been declining since admission, but
   never had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and
   declinic platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.  Will
   continue to monitor.  Will also attempt to obtain outside labs to get
   baseline WBC count.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rising, likely secondary to contrast administration,
   with possible component of ATN from hypotension when first admitted.
   - PM lytes
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry this AM; looks like accelerated
   idioventricular rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised
   hemodynamic stability.  Not concerning per cardiology, no need to work
   up further.
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Now improved.  Patient had some shortness of
   breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.  Feel likely
   an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal limits and improved
   with 0.5mg IV Ativan last night.  ABG reassuring.
   - Ativan VERY conservatively for subjective shortness of breath
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: restart baclofen 10mg TID
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home diltiazem in setting of hypotension/diuresis.
   .
   #.  Goals of care: Could consider palliative care consult given the
   patient

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical issues, including chronic reflux, who was admitted for MS changes. She presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. She is hypotensive and has evidence of urosepsis. Septic shock is a possible cause of her hypotension. The patient's SvO2 of 79% suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause. She is intravascularly volume depleted but has total body fluid overload.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to pulmonary edema and volume overload. She has been on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support, and her oxygen requirements have improved. However, she still benefits from continued slow diuresis.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia is currently stable. It could be secondary to infection, as her labs do not appear to be adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. The hypothermia is most likely related to urosepsis given her recent urinary tract infection and low blood pressures at admission. The patient was previously hospitalized for sepsis and treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   # Altered mental status: Likely med-effect due to ativan, though other
   possibilities include worsening infection, hypercarbia and an acute
   intracranial process.  We will check an ABG and give her a couple of
   hours to clear.  If she remains altered, can consider CT head.
   - ABG for hypercarbia.  If acidotic, can consider temporary BiPAP until
   clears.
   #.  Hypothermia: Hypothermia and altered mental status worrisome for
   infection in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 11**] have a
   resistant pseudomonas species.  Labs do not support adrenal
   insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is
   urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per
   notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated
   with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be
   intermittently hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount
   a fever and this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 5.
   - Add back ciprofloxacin given worsening status.
   - f/u pseudomonas sensitivities.
   - Bair hugger as needed, though it does make patient agitated at times.
   .
 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Patient has now been
   off pressors for more than 24 hours and tolerating gentle diuresis.  CT
   torso showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.
   Discussed with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be
   indicated currently.
   - PICC site likely simply traumatic, not likely infected at this time.
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   - vanco supratherapeutic (28.0), will hold dose and recheck in PM.
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary effusions and volume overload.
   LOS 9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have
   improved, she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit
   from continued slow diuresis.
   - can continue diuresis today; will live lasix 10 mg IV this AM and
   reasses in PM
   - family does not want to do thoracenteses at this time.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: WBC count stable but all lines are down.  Could be from
   acute infection.  WBC count has been declining since admission, but
   never had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and
   declinic platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.
   Thrombocytopenia is concerning for HIT.
   - hold heparin products with pneumoboots for prophylaxis.  Send HIT
   antibody.
   - pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rose from 0.3 to 0.9, now stabilized.  Likely
   secondary to contrast administration, with possible component of ATN
   from hypotension when first admitted.
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry this AM; looks like accelerated
   idioventricular rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised
   hemodynamic stability.  Not concerning per cardiology, no need to work
   up further.
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Improves with ativan.  Patient had some
   shortness of breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.
   Feel likely an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal
   limits.  Given somnolence with ativan, will attempt to simply reassure
   patient.
   - Avoid ativan for now.
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: restart baclofen 10mg TID
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home diltiazem in setting of hypotension/diuresis.
   .
   #.  Goals of care: Patient has been against escalation of care and has
   been in and out of the hospital repeatedly.   If she remains less
   responsive, will have to weigh discomfort of further procedures against
   wishes for comfort and desire to go home.
   - palliative care consult to discuss other options.
   - Will discuss with family

   Disposition: ICU for now.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent admissions for MS changes. She is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), hypothermia, hypoxia, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected urosepsis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. There is also mention of resistant pseudomonas species, which further supports the risk of infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures suggest septic shock as the cause, possibly due to urosepsis. It is crucial to closely monitor her blood pressure and ensure adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if needed.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's persistent hypothermia is concerning, especially since she is unable to mount a fever. This could be a manifestation of an inflammatory response or a sign of sepsis. Active warming measures should be implemented to maintain her body temperature within normal limits.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to pulmonary effusions and volume overload. Continued slow diuresis may help alleviate fluid overload, but further intervention such as thoracentesis might be necessary if there is worsening respiratory distress.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 F h/o papillary thyroid ca, MS, CAD, T2DM and hypothyroidism
   admitted from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with hypoglycemia,
   hypotension, and AMS.  Presentation appears most c/w septic shock
   likely from urinary source (presumed pyelo), though cx data has been
   unrevealing.  Has been improving from HD standpoint, though she
   continues to have intermittent hypothermia.  This am her MS was at
   baseline, but now she is somnolent and confused after receiving
   ativan.  Suspect med effect as primary etiology of her clinical change,
   though given the ongoing hypothermia, and ongoing or resistant
   infection remains a concern.
   Agree with plan to check abg to r/o hypercarbia, and consider use of
   NPPV if present. Follow MS/neuro exam, as suspect med effect to clear
   rather quickly.  Would reassess for presence of an underlying infection
   that might be resistant to current treatment, as we have had no pos cx
   to guide therapy.  Would pan cx and recheck ua.  We continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   for presumed pyelo and  would empirically add cipro for ? resistant GN
   infection, though this seems unlikely.
   --Her resp status has not really changed though she has large b
   effusions on imaging.  These seem likely from aggressive fluids given
   at presentation in pt with low albumin.  She has minimal o2
   requirements and is not in resp distress.  Will attempt to gently
   diurese, though would consider therapeutic and dx [**Female First Name (un) 231**] if resp status
   declines attempt gentle diuresis.
   --Etiology of her pancytopenia iremains unclear--? Related to meds,
   infection,? underlying marrow process. Infection work-up, monitor
   counts. She has notable thrombocytopenia ongoing since day 2 of
   hospital course.  Moderate prob for HIT if she had recent hep
   exposure.  Will d/c hep and check HIT ab.
   -Her arrythmia is an intermittent accelerated idioventricular rhythm,
   without impact on BP.
   --Her cr is up from her baseline, but holding.  Suspect ATN from
   hypotension and pressors.  Urine outpt remains adequate.  Will monitor
   closely with gentle diuresis.
   --We will continue to communicate with family and address goals of
   care.  Nutritional status is another issue, noting poor PO and low
   albumin.  Will ask for palliative care consultation .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The presentation appears to be consistent with septic shock, likely originating from a urinary source, although chest X-ray data has been unrevealing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C (95.7°F) at one point, but currently 34.9°C (94.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 76 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/40 mmHg to 132/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, somnolence, confusion, edema, diminished bilateral lower limb pulses, normal respiratory effort, and warmth with palpable distal pulses. There is also echymosis at the site of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 F h/o papillary thyroid ca, MS, CAD, T2DM and hypothyroidism
   admitted from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with hypoglycemia,
   hypotension, and AMS.  Presentation appears most c/w septic shock
   likely from urinary source (presumed pyelo), though cx data has been
   unrevealing.  Has been improving from HD standpoint, though she
   continues to have intermittent hypothermia.  This am her MS was at
   baseline, but now she is somnolent and confused after receiving
   ativan.  Suspect med effect as primary etiology of her clinical change,
   though given the ongoing hypothermia, and ongoing or resistant
   infection remains a concern.
   Agree with plan to check abg to r/o hypercarbia, and consider use of
   NPPV if present if pt can tolerate or trial of flumazenil. Follow
   MS/neuro exam, as suspect med effect to clear rather quickly.  Would
   reassess for presence of an underlying infection that might be
   resistant to current treatment, as we have had no pos cx to guide
   therapy.  Would pan cx and recheck ua.  We continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for
   presumed pyelo and will empirically add cipro for ? resistant GN
   infection, though this seems less likely.
   --Her resp status has not really changed though she has large b
   effusions on imaging.  These are most likely from aggressive fluids
   given at presentation in pt with low albumin.  She has minimal o2
   requirements and is not in resp distress.  Will attempt to gently
   diurese, though would consider therapeutic and dx [**Female First Name (un) 231**] if resp status
   declines and if family feels this would be in line with goals of care.
   --Etiology of her pancytopenia remains unclear--? Related to meds,
   infection,? underlying marrow process. Infection work-up, monitor
   counts. She has notable thrombocytopenia ongoing since day 2 of
   hospital course.  Moderate prob for HIT if she had recent hep
   exposure.  Will d/c hep and check HIT ab.
   -Her arrythmia is an intermittent accelerated idioventricular rhythm,
   without impact on BP.
   --Her cr remains up from her baseline, but holding.  Suspect ATN from
   hypotension and pressors.  Urine outpt remains adequate.  Will monitor
   closely with gentle diuresis.
   --We will continue to communicate with family and address goals of
   care.  Nutritional status continues to be an issue, noting poor PO and
   low albumin and will d/w family various options which include NGT or
   peg tube if pt continues to improve.  Will ask for palliative care
   consultation to assist with addressing these issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The presentation is consistent with septic shock, likely originating from a urinary source. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient continues to experience intermittent hypothermia, somnolence, and confusion. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation suggests septic shock, possibly due to a urinary source infection. There is concern about the effectiveness of current antibiotic therapy, as no positive culture results have guided treatment. Further infection work-up and monitoring are recommended.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has large effusions on imaging but minimal oxygen requirements. Respiratory status has not changed significantly. Diurese attempts will be made to manage fluid overload. Therapeutic options for respiratory distress, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), may be considered if the patient's respiratory status declines.
3. Pancytopenia: The etiology of the patient's low blood cell counts is unclear. Infection, medication, or an underlying marrow process could be contributing factors. Monitoring of blood counts and an infection work-up are advised.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

Chief Complaint: sepsis

History of papillary thyroid cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypothyroidism.

Admitted from another hospital with hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status (AMS). The presentation appears to be consistent with suspect septic shock likely from a urinary source, although chest data has been unrevealing.

The patient continues to improve from shock/sepsis standpoint and remains on a broad antibacterial course for presumed pyelonephritis.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line and central line, with a peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line being placed. The patient's temperature was low, so a Bair Hugger was used, and diuresis was also administered.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Goals of care: Conversation with family overnight; optd to make
   patient comfortable despite possible hypotension and oversedation.
   Will clarify goals of care further this AM regarding need for continued
   blood draws, abx, etc.
   - palliative care following, recs appreciated
   - Will discuss with family
   #.  Hypothermia: Hypothermia and altered mental status worrisome for
   infection in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 11**] have a
   resistant pseudomonas species.  Labs do not support adrenal
   insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is
   urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per
   notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated
   with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be
   intermittently hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount
   a fever and this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem for a total 14 day course for
   complicated UTI, today is day 5.
   - Add back ciprofloxacin given worsening status.
   - Bair hugger as needed, though it does make patient agitated at times.
   .
 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Patient has now been
   off pressors for more than 24 hours and tolerating gentle diuresis.  CT
   torso showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.
   Discussed with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be
   indicated currently.
   - PICC site likely simply traumatic, not likely infected at this time.
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   .
   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely due to pulmonary effusions and volume overload.
   LOS 9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have
   improved, she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit
   from continued slow diuresis.
   - can continue diuresis today; will live lasix 10 mg IV this AM and
   reasses in PM
   - family does not want to do thoracenteses at this time.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: WBC count stable but all lines are down.  Could be from
   acute infection.  WBC count has been declining since admission, but
   never had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and
   declinic platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.
   Thrombocytopenia is concerning for HIT.
   - hold heparin products with pneumoboots for prophylaxis.  Send HIT
   antibody.
   - pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rose from 0.3 to 1.0.  Likely secondary to contrast
   administration, with possible component of ATN from hypotension when
   first admitted.
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry ; looks like accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised hemodynamic
   stability.  Not concerning per cardiology, no need to work up further.
   .
   #. Shortness of breath: Improves with ativan.  Patient had some
   shortness of breath associated with being turned/moved or procedures.
   Feel likely an anxiety component as O2 sat always within normal
   limits.  Given somnolence with ativan, will attempt to simply reassure
   patient.
   - Avoid ativan for now.
   .
   #.  Hypoglycemia:  None since admission.  There is a diagnosis of DM in
   chart, however not on any glycemic control meds.  Fingersticks have
   been 129-164 now and admission hypoglycemia of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have been drug-related vs sepsis-related on admission.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: holding  baclofen 10mg TID per pall care recs
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home diltiazem in setting of hypotension/diuresis.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU for changes in mental status. She is experiencing bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient's family has decided to focus on comfort care rather than aggressive treatment. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected urosepsis, which may be resistant to certain antibiotics. She is also being treated for a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient is intermittently hypothermic, which could be a manifestation of an inflammatory response due to sepsis.
2. HYPOTENSION: The patient has persistently low blood pressures, likely due to septic shock. She was off pressors for over 24 hours but still required gentle diuresis. Chronic reflux resulting in hydronephrosis was found on a CT scan.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirements have improved, but she is total body fluid overloaded, suggesting the need for continued slow diuresis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is stable but all lines are down. It could be due to acute infection or drug reaction, possibly from vancomycin.
5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine has risen from 0.3 to 1.0, likely"

- The patient's urinary analysis still shows lots of bacteria despite receiving ciprofloxacin.
- The patient became somnolent after receiving Ativan and had an abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) result.
- Bipap was unsuccessful in tolerating, and flumazenil was given to reverse the effects of Ativan.
- The patient complained of discomfort and difficulty breathing, leading to the administration of 0.5 mg IV morphine.
- Palliative care was consulted and suggested holding baclofen and Ativan until mental status improves.
- Heparin was stopped, and a HIT antibody test was sent.
- Pneumoboots were applied, and urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.
- Family decided to prioritize patient comfort, even if it means compromising mental status and blood pressure.
- Patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/63 mmHg to 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 910 mL and a total output of 1841 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Goals of care: Conversation with family overnight; opted to make
   patient comfortable despite possible hypotension and oversedation.
   Will clarify goals of care further this AM regarding need for continued
   blood draws, abx, etc.
   - palliative care following, recs appreciated
   - Will discuss with family goals for dispo
   #.  Hypothermia: Hypothermia and altered mental status worrisome for
   infection in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 11**] have a
   resistant pseudomonas species.  Labs do not support adrenal
   insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is
   urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per
   notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated
   with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be
   intermittently hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount
   a fever and this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem/cipro for a total 14 day
   course for complicated UTI, today is day 6 (cipro day 2)
   - dose vanc by level
   - Bair hugger as needed, though it does make patient agitated at times.
   .
 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Patient has now been
   off pressors for more than 48 hours and tolerating gentle diuresis.  CT
   torso showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.
   Discussed with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be
   indicated currently.
   - PICC site likely simply traumatic, not likely infected at this time.
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   .
   #  Dyspnea:  Likely due to pulmonary effusions and volume overload.
   LOS 9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have
   improved, she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit
   from continued slow diuresis.
   - can continue diuresis today with goal of total 500-1L negative
   - symptomatic tx with morphine and ativan prn
   - family does not want to do thoracenteses at this time.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: WBC count stable but all lines are down.  Could be from
   acute infection.  WBC count has been declining since admission, but
   never had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and
   declinic platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.
   Thrombocytopenia is concerning for HIT.
   - hold heparin products with pneumoboots for prophylaxis.  Send HIT
   antibody.
   - pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine rose from 0.3 to 1.0.  Likely secondary to contrast
   administration, with possible component of ATN from hypotension when
   first admitted.
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry ; looks like accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised hemodynamic
   stability.  Not concerning per cardiology, no need to work up further.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: holding  baclofen 10mg TID per pall care recs
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home diltiazem in setting of hypotension/diuresis.
   .

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with recent admissions for multiple sclerosis (MS) changes and a history of MS. The patient presented with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The goals of care discussed with the family overnight were to make the patient comfortable despite possible hypotension and oversedation. 

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypothermia: The patient's persistent hypothermia is worrisome for infection, especially in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lab results do not support adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. It is believed that the hypothermia is likely related to urosepsis, given the recent urinary tract infection (UTI) and low systolic blood pressures at admission. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for a total 14-day course for complicated UTI, which is day 6 of treatment.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures are most likely due to septic shock, considering the evidence for urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures. The SvO2 of 79% suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause. The patient has been off pressors for more than 48 hours and is tolerating gentle diuresis. Chronic reflux causing hydronephrosis was identified on CT"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and multiple hospitalizations for urinary tract infections (UTIs), hypothermia, and altered mental status (AMS). She was admitted with AMS and shock and treated for a suspected UTI with partial improvement.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. She was treated for a UTI but still shows signs of decline, which may indicate a systemic infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure, which can be a result of sepsis and shock. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure.

3. Pleural effusions: The patient has large pleural effusions, likely due to fluid overload. These effusions need to be managed through diuresis to prevent further complications.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood counts are low, indicating pancytopenia. This can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, medication, or a hematological disorder.

5. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is below normal, suggesting hypothermia. This can be attributed to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

6. AMS: The patient's mental status remains significantly declined, indicating ongoing alterations in mental function. This may be due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MS), multiple hospitalizations for urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypothermia, and altered mental status (AMS). She was admitted with AMS and shock and treated for a suspected UTI. The patient has shown some improvement in AMS but remains significantly declined compared to yesterday morning. The cause of AMS is multifactorial, with concerns for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates signs of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Immediate attention should be given to managing the infection and monitoring for any further deterioration.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.
3. Pleural Effusions: The presence of large pleural effusions suggests fluid overload. Diuretic therapy may be attempted to remove excess fluid and reduce the effusions.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood count results indicate pancytopenia, which is characterized by low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause, and appropriate management should be initiated to address the low blood cell counts.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's core body temperature remains low, indicating persistent hypothermia. Active warming measures should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) changes, was admitted recently for MS changes. She presented with bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The family decided to focus on comfort care, discontinuing unnecessary medications, stopping blood pressure monitoring, and stopping morning labs. They also agreed to stop antibiotics for now. The patient is currently on a low-dose morphine drip for comfort and has a Bair Hugger for hypothermia and comfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a yeast infection in her urine with a high colony count, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures are pending, so there may be a risk of systemic infection as well.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,040 mL and output of 387 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 653 mL. This indicates potential fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 34.1°C (93.4°F), which is below the normal body temperature range. Prolonged hypothermia can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, decreased metabolic rate, and impaired organ function.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within the bradycardia range"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU for MS changes. She is currently unresponsive and experiencing bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The patient's family has requested comfort measures only, and all unnecessary medications, blood pressure monitoring, and morning labs have been discontinued. Blood cultures are pending, and the urine culture revealed a yeast infection with over 100,000 organisms/mL. The patient has been started on a low-dose morphine drip for comfort and is using a Bair Hugger for hypothermia and comfort. The patient's code status is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and DNI (Do Not Intubate). The patient is currently in the ICU with plans for palliative care and discussions about hospice disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The presence of a yeast infection in the urine suggests a potential infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated appropriately.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is consistently below normal levels, indicating hypothermia. If left untreated, hypothermia can cause various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, organ damage, and even death.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently below the normal range, indicating bradycardia. Bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and potentially"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo woman with recent admissions for MS changes and hx of MS, p/w
   bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoxia.
   #.  Goals of care: Multiple conversations with family, decided to make
   patient comfort measures only.  We will discontinue unnecessary
   antibiotics, blood draws, and blood pressures.  However, we
ll keep on
   antibiotics for now.
   - Palliative care following, recs appreciated
   - Will discuss with family goals for dispo including hospice, if
   patient stabilizes a bit.
   - Patient started on low-dose morphine drip for comfort.
   #.  Hypothermia: Hypothermia and altered mental status worrisome for
   infection in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 11**] have a
   resistant pseudomonas species.  Labs do not support adrenal
   insufficiency or hypothyroidism.   Feel that most likely is
   urosepsis-related given recent UTI and low SBPs at admission.  Per
   notes, patient was hospitalized at NWH from [**Date range (1) 9983**] and was treated
   with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis.   Unclear why patient continues to be
   intermittently hypothermic; it is possible that she is unable to mount
   a fever and this is a manifestation of an inflammatory response.
   - Continue treatment with Vanc/Meropenem/cipro for a total 14 day
   course for complicated UTI, today is day 7 (cipro day 2)
   - dose vanc by level
   - Bair hugger as needed, though it does make patient agitated at times.
   .
 HYPOTENSION: Most likely due to septic shock given evidence for
   urosepsis and persistently low blood pressures.  Had SvO2 of 79% which
   suggests against cardiogenic shock as a cause.  Patient has now been
   off pressors for more than 48 hours and tolerating gentle diuresis.  CT
   torso showed hydronephrosis likely secondary to chronic reflux.
   Discussed with urology and IR and decided intervention would not be
   indicated currently.
   - PICC site likely simply traumatic, not likely infected at this time.
   - FU blood, urine cultures
   .
   #  Dyspnea:  Likely due to pulmonary effusions and volume overload.
   LOS 9 L positive.  Although patient
s oxygen requirements have
   improved, she is total body fluid overloaded and would likely benefit
   from continued slow diuresis.
   - can continue diuresis today with goal of total 500-1L negative
   - symptomatic tx with morphine and ativan prn
   - family does not want to do thoracenteses at this time.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: WBC count stable but all lines are down.  Could be from
   acute infection.  WBC count has been declining since admission, but
   never had a left shift or bandemia.  It is possible that low WBC and
   declinic platelets could be a drug reaction, maybe to vancomycin.
   Thrombocytopenia is concerning for HIT.
   - hold heparin products with pneumoboots for prophylaxis.  HIT
   antibodies pending.
   - pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine is still 1.0 from 0.3 on admission.  Likely secondary
   to contrast administration, with possible component of ATN from
   hypotension when first admitted.
   - continue to monitor, renally dose medications
   .
   # Arrhythmia seen on telemetry ; looks like accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm.  This is transient and has not compromised hemodynamic
   stability.  Not concerning per cardiology, no need to work up further.
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism: T4 at appropriate level, continue home
   levothyroxine dose at IV dosing
   .
   #.  MS: holding  baclofen 10mg TID per pall care recs
   .
   #.  HTN: holding home diltiazem in setting of hypotension/diuresis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU for MS changes. She is experiencing bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The family has decided to focus on comfort care and discontinue unnecessary medications, including antibiotics for now. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 34.2°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/25 mmHg to 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has a yeast infection in the urine culture, with more than 100,000 organisms per mL. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 110 K/uL, anemia with an Hct level of 28.7%, and thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 100 K/uL. Other labs indicate renal impairment with a Cr level of 1.0 mg/dL, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactic acid levels.

The patient's assessment includes hypothermia, altered mental status, hypotension, dyspnea, pancytopenia, acute kidney injury, and arrhythmia. The most likely cause of hypothermia is urosepsis, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU for changes in her MS symptoms. She has developed bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypoxia. The family has requested comfort measures only, discontinuing antibiotics, blood draws, and temperature monitoring. The patient is currently on a low-dose morphine drip for comfort and is using a Bair Hugger for hypothermia and comfort. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to MS and the use of immunosuppressive medications. This increases the risk of infections, especially if antibiotics are discontinued.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which can progress to respiratory failure if oxygenation levels continue to deteriorate.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: Bradycardia is already present, and there is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's MS and potential electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and decreased nutrition can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT.
6. Autonomic dysreflexia: This is"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including MS and DM. She was admitted with hypothermia, altered mental status, and suspected sepsis not responding to antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs show hypotension, with a blood pressure of 78/25 mmHg, and a temperature of 34.1°C (93.4°F). The patient is also on low-dose morphine and CMO.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.3 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 94 to 141 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels. The liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are within normal range, as well as the kidney function tests (creatinine, BUN, etc.). The electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and her cardiovascular and respiratory systems are normal. However, she has decreased peripheral pulses and no neurologic assessment was performed.

Based on this information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's suspected sepsis not responding to antibiotics indicates a potential risk of septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests hypot"
