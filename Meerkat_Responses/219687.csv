   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] is a 57-year-old man with h/o ILD, recent admission for
   alveolar hemorrhage, also h/o afib, CAD, DM2, HTN who was transferred
   from [**Location (un) 206**] for hypoxia. He presented to OSH with hypoxia, was
   intubated.
   # Respiratory failure: with hypoxia requiring intubation. Hemoptysis
   raises concern for recurrent or persistent alveolar hemorrhage that was
   diagnosed from last admission. Also likely due to worsening of ILD
   despite prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Productive coughs also raises
   concern for pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented to the hospital with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and other supportive treatments. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient's physical examination shows coarse breath sounds bilaterally, regular heart rate and rhythm, and no other significant findings. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18000 cells/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated troponin-T, and elevated lactate levels. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, insulin, and other supportive therapies. The assessment and plan include continuing ventilatory support, empirical antibiotic therapy, and further diagnostic tests such as chest CT and bronchoscopy to evaluate for recurrent alveolar hemorrhage or pneumonia. The patient's code status is set to FULL code, and his family has been notified.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented to the hospital with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by recurrent or persistent alveolar hemorrhage and possible pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving sedation, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. The patient is also being treated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent or persistent alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's history of ILD and recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage raises concern for recurrent or persistent alveolar bleeding. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially require more aggressive interventions such as repeated transfusions or surgery.
2. Pneumonia: The productive cough and concern for pneumonia indicate a potential infection in the lungs. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can progress and lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased mortality.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   57M h/o presumed ILD, recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage
   syndrome, also h/o afib, CAD, DM2, HTN was transferred from [**Location (un) 6648**] hospital in NH last evening for management of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.  Pt was d/c on [**5-1**] from [**Hospital1 5**] admission to rehab
   where he was until a week and a half ago.  Over last several days at
   home developed progressive DOE and at rest with increasing oxygen
   requirement (inc to 8-10L via NC)   At ED in OSH initial sats in 70
   placed on NRB w/ sats in mid 90
s.  Intubated prior to transfer.  Of
   note, wife told son that pt had been having some hemoptysis last
   several days.  Sxn here has not revealed any bloody secretions.
   Hypoxemic resp failure
   -progressive over last several days prior to admission
   -presentation/onset similar to presentation at last admission
   -reasonable to restart on solumedrol empirically since seemed to lead
   to improvement last admission

   vent
   -CXR without significant focality and no bloody secretions on
   suctioning
   -CT of chest to better visualize parenchyma
 assess for
   focality/region where might benefit from FOB/BAL.  Right now, no clear
   target
   -presumed alveolar hemorrhage vs. acute progression of ILD vs. PE

He was transferred from another hospital for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient had been discharged from a rehabilitation facility a week and a half ago and developed progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and at rest, along with increasing oxygen requirements.

Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the 70s and he was placed on a non-rebreather mask with improved saturation levels in the mid-90s. The patient was subsequently intubated prior to transfer. The wife reported that the patient had been experiencing hemoptysis over the last several days, and during the hospital stay, only blood-tinged thick sputum was observed.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] is a 57-year-old man with h/o ILD, recent admission for
   alveolar hemorrhage, also h/o afib, CAD, DM2, HTN who was transferred
   from [**Location (un) 206**] for hypoxia. He presented to OSH with hypoxia, was
   intubated.
   # Respiratory failure: with hypoxia requiring intubation. Hemoptysis
   raises concern for recurrent or persistent alveolar hemorrhage that was
   diagnosed from last admission. Also likely due to worsening of ILD
   despite prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Productive coughs also raises
   concern for pneumonia.
   - continue ventilatory support; wean sedation, wean settings SBT and
   extubate if tolerated
   - methylpred 1 gm q24h
   - empiric vanc and ceftaz; d/c if negative sputum/blood cx
   - consider chest CT and bronch if CT positive for diagnosis
   # Afib: currently in sinus rhhtym.
   - hold warfarin given hemoptysis
   - hold sotalol 160 mg [**Hospital1 **] given recent hypotensive episodes with
   sedation; will restart once BP more stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from [**Location (un) 206**] for hypoxia and presented to OSH with hypoxia, subsequently being intubated.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with hypoxia requiring intubation, hemoptysis, and a productive cough, which raises concerns for recurrent or persistent alveolar hemorrhage and potential pneumonia. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 142/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient's medical history also includes atrial fibrillation, for which he is currently in sinus rhythm. However, warfarin has been held due to hemoptysis, and sotalol has been temporarily discontinued due to hypotensive episodes with sedation. His diabetes mellitus type 2 requires insulin supplementation. 

In terms of nutrition, the patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with plans to replete electrolytes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] is a 57-year-old man with h/o ILD, recent admission for
   alveolar hemorrhage occurring after afib ablation, CAD, DM2, HTN who
   was transferred from [**Location (un) 206**] for hypoxia. He presented to OSH
   with hypoxia, was intubated.
   # Respiratory failure/Interstitial lung disease:  History of ILD and
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**].  Was treated with prednisone for ILD starting
   in [**2111-1-1**] and did have radiological and clinical improvement, but
   admitted with alveolar hemorrhage in [**2111-4-1**], thought to be
   secondary to vasculitis (though ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative), resulting in
   course of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.   Now admitted again for
   dyspnea in setting of hemoptysis and productive cough per report.  Also
   re-started on coumadin in interim by cardiologist for afib.  Chest CT
   from [**5-24**] shows largely stable disease, diffuse ground glass opacities
   bilaterally.  Intubated for hypoxia and dyspnea.  Previously on APRV
   but now on AC.
   - bronch to eval for infectious disease, alveolar hemorrhage
   - wean sedation as tolerated, consider SBT tomorrow
   - reduce methyprednisolone dose to 60 mg IV qd
   - restart vanc/ceftaz after bronch
   - poor candidate for surgical biopsy
   # Afib: currently in sinus rhythm, s/p recent ablation.
   - hold warfarin given hemoptysis
   - restart sotalol 160 mg [**Hospital1 **]; initially held because of
   sedation-related hypoxia
   # DM2:
   - insulin s.s.
   # Spinal stenosis:  has caused significant debilitation per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 104**].
   - pain management as needed when extubated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation (afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from another location for hypoxia and presented to the hospital with hypoxia, leading to intubation. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure. The chest CT shows diffuse ground glass opacities bilaterally, which indicates ongoing inflammation and potential complications such as pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes restarting pcp prophylaxis and cyclophosphamide, holding antibiotics due to lack of infiltrate, weaning off APRV and transitioning to assist-control ventilation (AC), and stabilizing the patient's heart rhythm. The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin, and he is also on pain management for spinal stenosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic status to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension. He presented with hypoxia and was intubated. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure/ILD, presumed vasculitic ILD (NSIP). He underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday with gross evidence of bloody fluid. His current medications include vancomycin, ceftazidime, propofol, midazolam, sotalol, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a primary concern, especially considering his underlying ILD and recent alveolar hemorrhage. The ventilator settings and oxygen delivery device should be closely monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime) due to the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Regular assessment of his temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory parameters will help monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure readings show some fluctuations, which could indicate hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of his vital signs and appropriate adjustments in fluid administration and medication dos"

   admitted with alveolar hemorrhage in [**2111-4-1**], thought to be
   secondary to vasculitis (though ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative), resulting in
   course of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.   Now again with respiratory
   failure in setting of hemoptysis and productive cough per report.  Also
   re-started on coumadin in interim by cardiologist for afib.  Chest CT
   from [**5-24**] shows largely stable disease, diffuse ground glass opacities

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from another location for hypoxia and presented to the hospital with hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to presumed vasculitic ILD (NSIP) and has undergone bronchoscopy with a BAL HCT < 2. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal kidney and liver function. He has been treated with various medications including prednisone, cyclophosphamide, methyprednisolone, vanc/ceftaz, and insulin. The patient is a poor candidate for surgical biopsy. His condition is being closely monitored, and the medical team is considering weaning PEEP as tolerated and continuing with current medications. The patient's family has been informed of his condition and provided with contact information for communication.

   admitted with alveolar hemorrhage in [**2111-4-1**], thought to be
   secondary to vasculitis (though ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative), resulting in
   course of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.   Now again with respiratory
   failure in setting of hemoptysis and productive cough per report.  Also
   re-started on coumadin in interim by cardiologist for afib.  Chest CT
   from [**5-24**] shows largely stable disease, diffuse ground glass opacities

","Summary of the progress note:

Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**], a 57-year-old man, is admitted to the ICU with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented with hypoxia and was intubated. 

The patient has been treated with prednisone for ILD but had a recurrence of alveolar hemorrhage, possibly due to vasculitis. He received a course of prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Currently, he is on methyprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and underwent percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) ablation. He is currently in sinus rhythm but on sotalol. Warfarin is held due to hemoptysis. 

Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He requires insulin for glycemic control and will start captopril for hypertension. 

The patient also suffers from spinal stenosis, which has caused significant debilitation. Pain management will be provided when extubated. 

Family contact information is provided.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure/Interstitial lung disease: The patient's history of ILD and recurrent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to his lung condition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage occurring after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from another location for hypoxia and presented to the hospital with hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure due to ILD with acute decompensations attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). He is being treated with mechanical ventilation and sedation, and his PEEP and FiO2 levels are being adjusted as tolerated. The patient is also receiving medications such as methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and Bactrim prophylaxis. Cultures are being monitored for any fungal or bacterial growth, and beta glucan and galactomannan tests are pending. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm following a recent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation. Sotalol is being used for maintaining sinus rhythm, and warfarin has been held due to hemoptysis. The patient's hypertension is being managed with increased captopril. Constipation/ileus is being addressed with the initiation of po naloxone. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 requires insulin supplementation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] is a 57-year-old man with h/o ILD, recent admission for
   alveolar hemorrhage occurring after afib ablation, CAD, DM2, HTN who
   was transferred from [**Location (un) 206**] for hypoxia. He presented to OSH
   with hypoxia, was intubated.
   # Respiratory failure/Interstitial lung disease:  History of ILD and
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**].  Was treated with prednisone for ILD starting
   in [**2111-1-1**] and did have radiological and clinical improvement, but
   admitted with alveolar hemorrhage in [**2111-4-1**], thought to be
   secondary to vasculitis (though ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative), resulting in
   course of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.   Now again with respiratory
   failure in setting of hemoptysis and productive cough per report.  Also
   re-started on coumadin in interim by cardiologist for afib.  Chest CT
   from [**5-24**] shows largely stable disease, diffuse ground glass opacities
   bilaterally.  Intubated for hypoxia and dyspnea.  Presumed vasculitic
   ILD (NSIP) although this is not certain.  Bronched on [**5-26**].  Hct from
   BAL < 2.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - cont methyprednisolone 100 mg IV qd (started [**5-28**]; previously
   received  3x doses of 1g solumedrol) and bactrim ppx
   - continue cyclophosphamide
   - d/c vanc/ceftaz given neg bacterial cultures
   - f/u bronch cultures, growing fungus in prelim
   - check beta glucan and galacatamannan
   - poor candidate for surgical biopsy
   - f/u bcx from [**5-24**] (one set; anaerobic bottle growing bacteria,
   aerobic bottle with no growth); likely contaminant
   # Afib: currently in sinus rhythm, s/p recent PVI ablation. On sotalol.
   - hold warfarin given hemoptysis
   # HTN: Cont captopril.
   # Constipation/Ileus:  Will start po naloxone.
   # DM2:

","Summary:
- 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN).
- Transferred from another location for hypoxia.
- Presented to the hospital with hypoxia, intubated.
- Diagnosed with respiratory failure/ILD.
- Treated with prednisone for ILD and cyclophosphamide for suspected vasculitis.
- Currently on methyprednisolone IV, cyclophosphamide, and bactrim prophylaxis.
- Cultures are pending, and beta glucan and galactomannan tests are being checked.
- Poor candidate for surgical biopsy.
- Previous bronchoscopy showed no evidence of infection.
- Recent chest CT shows diffuse ground glass opacities bilaterally.
- Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), spinal stenosis, and constipation/ileus.
- Family history includes a wife who is a co-healthcare professional.
- ICU care includes arterial line, 20-gauge line, and PICC line placement, as well as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old obese man who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, not ARDS. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of acute and chronic pain, hypertension, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), interstitial lung disease (ILD), ineffective coping, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility.
3. Stress ulcers - Prolonged critical illness and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections - The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Complications related to diabetes - The patient's poorly controlled diabetes may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Fluid overload - The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating the possibility of fluid overload.
7. Barotrauma - The high peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures suggest the potential risk of barotrauma.
8. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) - The patient's lung condition and high ventilator settings may predispose him to VILI."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with respiratory failure due to alveolar hemorrhage. They have been on mechanical ventilation in the ICU and have shown improvement over the past 4-5 days. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics, including ceftazidime and vancomycin. They are sedated and intubated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.5Â°C (97.7Â°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/77 mmHg to 174/85 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration of 0, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,533 mL with 301 mL given through total fluid, 1,013 mL given through IV fluids, and 200 mL given through tube feeding. The output includes 2,560 mL of urine and 555 mL of blood products. The overall fluid balance is negative by 1,027 mL.

Respiratory support indicates that the patient is on continuous mandatory ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O, and inspiratory pressure of 27 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits, with a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 345 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

Physical examination findings include coarse ventilation, trace edema in extremities, and a benign abdomen. The patient has a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 205 K/uL, and other laboratory values within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has hypertension, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), acute respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) post-ablation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to alveolar hemorrhage. The patient has a history of hypertension, benign, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), interstitial lung disease (ILD), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and type II diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C (97.7Â°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/77 mmHg to 174/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 25.4%, platelet count of 204 K/uL, blood glucose level of 102 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 1.8 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.8 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 345, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 29 mEq/L.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including ceftazidime and vancomycin, as well as midazolam, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,533 mL and output of 2,560 mL since 12 AM, with a negative balance of 1,027 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,560 mL since 12 AM.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and fluid overload. The patient's respiratory support and high tidal volumes may increase the risk of VILI. The use of high PEEP may also lead to barotrauma or volutrauma. Additionally, the patient's fluid balance suggests a potential risk of fluid overload. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these factors are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure/ILD. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and unresponsive. He has a history of vasculitic ILD (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia) with acute decompensations attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. His current medications include methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and decreased sotalol due to elevated QTc. He is also being managed for hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient has been in the ICU for a while, which increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, especially since there is mention of a growing fungus in the sputum culture.
3. Barotrauma: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with high pressures, which can increase the risk of barotrauma.
4. Pneumothorax: Extubation may pose a risk of pneumothorax due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred from another location for respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes being sedated and non-responsive, with ongoing respiratory failure due to vasculitic ILD (Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia) and acute decompensations attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient's ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 370 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 219 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 25.4% to 28.5%, platelet count (Plt) of [**missing value**], creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 102 to 147 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results, including liver function tests (ALT/AST), kidney function tests (BUN/creatinine), and cardiac markers (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T), are within normal limits or non-specific.

The patient's medical plan includes weaning off sedation, changing to propofol from fentanyl, discontinuing vancomycin and ceftazidime given negative bacterial cultures, and initiating antifungal therapy due to preliminary growth of fungus in sputum culture. The patient's medications also include methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, sotalol (on hold due to elevated QTc), and increased captopril.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, particularly in relation to the use of mechanical ventilation and PEEP, is essential to prevent these complications. Additionally, careful management of the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and close monitoring of fungal infection progression are necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from another location for hypoxia and presented to the hospital with respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated with propofol.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of ILD and recent alveolar hemorrhage indicate underlying vasculitic ILD (Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia) with acute decompensations attributed to DAH (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage). The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which is currently set to a volume-controlled mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 370.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly obese man who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including propofol infusion, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, ceftazidime, vancomycin, sotalol, and captopril. The patient's sedation is being weaned, and there are plans to gradually decrease the steroid dose over a one-month period. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-191 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactic acid levels. Other lab values, such as creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and glucose levels are within normal ranges or show slight variations. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 370 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 30 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%, and base excess (BE) of -8.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and warm, well-perfused extremities.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The patient is also being treated for pain, constipation, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), interstitial lung disease (ILD), ineffective coping, and acute respiratory failure.

Nutrition is being provided through enteral feeds, and the patient's arterial and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines have been placed. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also in place.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory deterioration, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and complications related to diabetes mellitus type II."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-162/50-79 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, along with decreased platelet count and potassium levels. The patient's CXR is clear. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing medical conditions that require management, including hypertension, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), respiratory failure (not ARDS), diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation. The plan includes continuing captopril for hypertension, weaning steroids for DAH, attempting spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for respiratory failure, continuing insulin for DM, restarting sotolol once QTc shortens for atrial fibrillation, and providing ICU care including nutrition support and glycemic control. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are also in place."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage occurring after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred from another location for hypoxia and presented to the hospital with respiratory failure/ILD. He was intubated and received treatment including methyprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and diuresis. His condition improved, and he was extubated on [**2111-5-31**].

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ILD and recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage. These conditions can lead to respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support.

2. Infection: The patient had negative bacterial cultures but grew fungus in preliminary cultures. This indicates a potential fungal infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient underwent PVI ablation for atrial fibrillation. It is crucial to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust medications as necessary to maintain sinus rhythm.

4. Hypotension and shock: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and prompt management of hypotension are essential to prevent shock.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid"

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage occurring after atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented to the hospital with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure/ILD. The patient has undergone several interventions including extubation, restart of sotalol, ECG order placement, increased captopril dose, and extubation. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been weaned off it. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 197 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.4%, and normal platelet count (Plt) of 142 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse infiltrates consistent with interstitial lung disease. The patient's condition is being managed with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, pain management, and glycemic control. His family has been informed of his condition, and he is currently on full code status."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly obese man with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation but was extubated today. The patient restarted sotalol and an ECG order has been placed for tomorrow. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications such as pantoprazole, metoprolol, and captopril.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/68 mmHg to 180/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal blood pressure and heart rate within the normal range. The patient has received a total fluid input of 1,222 mL and has had a total fluid output of 3,730 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 2,508 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on an aerosol-cool O2 delivery device, standby ventilator mode, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 16, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, RSBI of 65, PIP of 11 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 30, HCO3- of 32, and BE of -2.

During the physical examination, the patient appears to be an elderly obese man with no abnormalities noted in the HEENT, neck, lungs, CV, abdomen, or extremities. The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, as well as elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. The patient's arterial blood gases indicate respiratory alkalosis with compensatory metabolic acidosis.

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, constipation, hypertension, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, interstitial lung disease, ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and others. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial line, PICC line, and 20-gauge line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP), and comments regarding communication and code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress or failure, infection due to the presence of lines and tubes, cardiovascular events due to hypertension and/or the patient's pre-existing conditions, and complications related to diabetes mellitus type II."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with her
   note above, including assessment and plan.  PMH, SH, FH and ROS are
   unchanged from admission except where noted above.
   57 yo man with ILD (chronic, likely NSIP) and DAH/vasculitis now with
   ARDS on pulsed solumedrol/cytoxan. Started this course of
   solumedrol/cytoxan [**5-24**].
   Extubated5/31.
   Solumedrol 100 qd. Cytoxan 100mg qd.
   Exam sig for sitting up in stretcher chair. Speaking more easily.
   Crackles at lateral bases. NABS and abd soft NDNT. Trace peripheral
   edema. No rashes.
   Key issue is chronic respiratory failure with ILD now with superimposed
   DAH/vasculitis, readmitted to hospital with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure due to ARDS. The etiology of this exacerbation is unclear, as
   bronch did not reveal recurrent DAH (despite hemoptysis as outpatient
   prior to readmission) and all cultures have been negative. Was treated
   with antibiotics, but stopped since suspicion for infection is low.
   Continue prednisone with taper as outlined above.
   Mr [**Known lastname 5979**] SHOULD NOT BE ANTICOAGULATED because of his recent severe
   hemoptysis and DAH, regardless of his known afib.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage after atrial fibrillation ablation. He was transferred for hypoxia and presented with respiratory failure. The patient has chronic ILD, likely non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage/vasculitis. He was treated with pulsed solumedrol/cytoxan and extubated on 5/31. The patient's medications include methyprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination shows sclera anicteric, ET in place, supple neck, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen is soft and obese with rare bowel sounds, and extremities are warm, well perfused, and without edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for respiratory failure/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and presented with respiratory failure due to ILD. He was intubated and extubated on [**2111-5-31**]. The patient has been diagnosed with a fungal infection in the respiratory tract, and his current medications include methyprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and autodiuresing. He is also being managed for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and spinal stenosis. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying ILD and recent alveolar hemorrhage may predispose him to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.
2. Infection: The presence of a fungal infection in the respiratory tract indicates a potential risk of further infections. Regular assessment of cultures, beta glucan, and galactomannan levels should be performed to detect any new or worsening infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's recent alveolar hemorrhage suggests a predisposition to bleeding. Any signs of hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), recent admission for alveolar hemorrhage following atrial fibrillation ablation, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypertension (HTN). He presented to the hospital with hypoxia, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ILD with acute decompensations due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). He was extubated on May 31st and antibiotics were discontinued on June 1st due to negative bacterial cultures. The patient is currently receiving methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as part of his treatment plan. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) for which he underwent percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) ablation. His medications for afib include sotalol, and warfarin is held due to hemoptysis. The patient has comorbidities such as spinal stenosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He is being managed with pain medication for spinal stenosis, insulin for diabetes, and captopril for hypertension. The patient is also being treated for thrush with nystatin and constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. He experiences restless legs syndrome and is given ropinirole as needed. In the ICU, the patient's"
