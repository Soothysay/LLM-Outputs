","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of metastatic bladder cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for concern of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and has been experiencing chest and epigastric pain. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, and hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 95/38 mmHg to 147/77 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count at 11.1 K/uL, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range at 0.16 ng/mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals thinness, cachexia, and edema of the lower extremities. No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis is present. The patient is alert, oriented, and denies any other specific complaints.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   89 yo F with metastatic bladder cancer and new upper GI bleed.
   # GI bleed/Chest pain:  GI is aware of the patient and has requested
   RUQ U/S this am.  No outward evidence of bleeding since transfer, but
   Hct down from 34
31 this morning.  Pt reporting chest/epigastic pain
   this AM on exam; also pt remains tachycardic to 130
s.  ? if these
   symptoms are related to ongoing GI bleed vs anxiety.    Pt has not
   required transfusion this admission but has active T+S.
   - transfuse for hct <30 if actively bleeding
   - Keep NPO, NGT until  EGD performed
   - Trend hct q4 hours
   - Telemetry
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - morphine PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Anxiety vs PE vs blood loss.  Pt scheduled for LENIs
   this AM to assess for DVT given LE edema.
   - repeat ECG this AM
   - LENIs this AM
   - repeat CXR
   .
   # Bladder cancer: Patient with metastatic disease currently undergoing
   palliative radiation.  Per discussion this AM, the patient does not
   wish to continue with treatment and has asked to go home and die
   naturally.  At this time, the patient may benefit from a palliative
   care consult and discussion with family regarding her goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic bladder cancer who has been admitted to the ICU for concern of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She has a history of taking Plavix and experiences chest pain, burning pressure, and epigastric pain that feels constant and is associated with anxiety. The patient has expressed her desire to stop all treatments and die naturally. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 133 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 99/38 mmHg to 147/77 mmHg. The patient is pale, dry, and cachetic, with edema in her lower extremities. Her blood work reveals anemia, elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and low albumin levels. She has been given IV fluids and is being treated with morphine for pain. The patient has not required a blood transfusion but has active tachycardia and is scheduled for further investigations, including an upper endoscopy (EGD), a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI), and repeat chest X-ray. The patient's condition is complicated by potential ongoing GI bleeding, anxiety, possible pulmonary embolism, hyperkalemia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not int"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo F with metastatic bladder cancer and new upper GI bleed.
   # GI bleed/Chest pain:  GI is aware of the patient and has requested
   RUQ U/S this am.  No outward evidence of bleeding since transfer, but
   Hct down from 34
31 this morning.  Pt reporting chest/epigastic pain
   this AM on exam; also pt remains tachycardic to 130
s.  ? if these
   symptoms are related to ongoing GI bleed vs anxiety.    Pt has not
   required transfusion this admission but has active T+S.
   - transfuse for hct <30 if actively bleeding
   - Keep NPO, NGT until  EGD performed
   - Trend hct q4 hours
   - Telemetry
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - morphine PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Anxiety vs PE vs blood loss.  Pt scheduled for LENIs
   this AM to assess for DVT given LE edema.
   - repeat ECG this AM
   - LENIs this AM
   - repeat CXR
   .
   # Bladder cancer: Patient with metastatic disease currently undergoing
   palliative radiation.  Per discussion this AM, the patient does not
   wish to continue with treatment and has asked to go home and die
   naturally.  At this time, the patient may benefit from a palliative
   care consult and discussion with family regarding her goals of care.
   - treat pain prn
   - Palliative care consult.
   .
   # LE edema: [**Month (only) 11**] be dependent edema, due to DVTs, hypoalbuminemia, or
   lymphatic/vascular obstruction due to the metastatic cancer.
   - LENI
   - elevate legs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/acute on chronic renal failure: Potassium down to 4.8.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have further obstruction of ureters and obstructive renal
   dysfunction.  More likely though to be prerenal azotemia.  Will give IV
   fluids and treat potassium with Kayexelate prn
   .
   # COPD: Patient without signs of current exacerbation.  Normal 02 sat.
   Will continue outpatient meds with albuterol prn
   .
   # Hx CVA: Not currently on aspirin
   .
   # FEN:  IVF as pt appears dry on exam, will need to monitor pulm exam
   as has bibasilar rales.
    NPO for now, but need to address nutritional status after cleared  to
   eat.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of metastatic bladder cancer. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently experiencing tachycardia. The patient has a history of COPD but does not currently exhibit signs of exacerbation. She also has a history of CVA and is not currently on aspirin.

The patient has undergone an endoscopy, which revealed superficial linear ulceration in the distal third of the esophagus and more extensive ulceration at the gastroesophageal junction with a single 1 cm shelf-like lesion. There was a 5 mm red spot without visible vessel and no active bleeding. The esophageal ulcerations could be secondary to prednisone use. No active bleeding was noted to explain her current tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 113/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. Her blood work indicates anemia with a hemoglobin level of 31.1 g/dL. The patient's electrolytes show hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient's overall condition is complicated by several factors. She has widespread metastatic disease in the liver and evidence of old deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic bladder cancer who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The endoscopy did not show any active bleeding, but there were signs of ulceration in the esophagus possibly due to steroid use. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been decreasing, but she has not required a blood transfusion this admission. She also has a history of COPD and evidence of old deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). The patient is currently receiving palliative radiation for her metastatic disease and has been started on heparin therapy for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). She has widespread metastatic disease in the liver and is experiencing lower extremity edema, which may be related to her DVTs, hypoalbuminemia, or lymphatic/vascular obstruction due to metastatic cancer. The patient also has hyperkalemia and acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to prerenal azotemia. She is currently on IV fluids and has been NPO (nothing by mouth) for now. Her nutritional status needs to be addressed after she is cleared to eat. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient has already experienced GIB, which can continue or worsen if not properly managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of metastatic bladder cancer, who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The endoscopy was negative for active bleeding, but there were signs of ulceration in the esophagus, possibly secondary to steroid use. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable, and she has not required a blood transfusion during this admission. However, she is tachycardic and hypoxemic.

The patient has a history of old deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and her Modified Wells criteria score is 7, indicating a high probability of a pulmonary embolism (PE). Due to her baseline lung disease (COPD and metastases), a V/Q scan may not be helpful, and a CT chest is unlikely to be pursued due to renal dysfunction. However, the preliminary results from LENIs indicate positive findings for old DVTs bilaterally. Therefore, the plan is to continue with Heparin therapy and aim for a conservative PTT goal of 55-70.

The patient also has widespread metastatic disease in the liver, which may explain the presence of widespread metastases seen on abdominal ultrasound. She is currently undergoing palliative radiation for her bladder cancer.

The patient has dependent edema in her lower extremities, which could be due to DVTs, hypoalbuminemia, or lymphatic/vascular obstruction due to"

The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic bladder cancer and a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has evidence of old deep vein thromboses (DVTs), persistent tachycardia, and borderline hypoxemia. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss or anemia. The patient's past medical history includes COPD, renal dysfunction, and bladder cancer with metastasis. She is currently undergoing palliative radiation for her cancer.

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has signs of ulceration in the esophagus, which could be secondary to steroid use. She has not required transfusion this admission but has active tachycardia. It is important to monitor her Hct levels and continue IV PPI therapy. Transfuse for Hct <25 and consider ADAT (celiac diet).

   fluids yesterday, depsite signs of hypovolemia on exam. Pt was also
   borderline hypoxemic, but she does have COPD and unknown baseline O2
   saturation. Her Modified [**Doctor Last Name 2617**] Criteria Score is 7, making her high
   probablity of PE. Unfortunately due to baseline lung disease (copd,
   mets) a v/q scan will likely not be helpful. Given renal dysfunction,
   CTA Chest unlikely to be pursued.   LENIs positive for old DVTs

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of metastatic bladder cancer and new upper gastrointestinal bleed. The endoscopy was negative for active bleeding. She is persistently tachycardic with borderline hypoxemia. There is evidence of old deep vein thromboses (DVTs), so Heparin therapy has been initiated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. GI bleed/Anemia: The patient has signs of ulceration in the esophagus, which may be secondary to steroid use. Her hemoglobin (Hct) is stable, but she has active tachycardia. No transfusion has been required this admission, but she has not had any bloody stools or nausea/vomiting. It is recommended to continue IV PPI, monitor Hct trends, provide a celiac diet, and transfuse for Hct <25.

2. Venous Thromboembolus (PE): The patient's tachycardia was not responsive to fluids yesterday, despite signs of hypovolemia on exam. She is borderline hypoxemic but has COPD and unknown baseline O2 saturation. Her Modified [Doctor Last Name 2617] Criteria Score is 7, making her a high probability of having a PE.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). 

The patient's DVT is indicated by preliminary read results showing old DVT bilaterally. Acute renal failure is suggested by a decrease in hemoglobin levels from 30.3 to 31.1 and an increase in serum creatinine from 2.0 to 2.3 mg/dL. The presence of gastrointestinal bleeding is evident from the endoscopy findings, which revealed superficial linear ulceration in the distal third of the esophagus, more extensive ulceration at the gastroesophageal junction with a single 1 cm shelf-like lesion, and a 5 mm red spot without a visible vessel and no active bleeding in the esophagus. Additionally, there was a large greyish material in the fundus. 

The patient's vital signs indicate sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid administration and urine output, but the patient remains oliguric with only 30 cc of urine produced in the last 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with low sodium, potassium, and calcium levels.

The patient has a history of allergies to Plavix and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of metastatic cancer, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, lower extremity clots, and acute renal failure. She has been started on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and others. She has an arterial line, nasogastric tube, and multiple IV lines. Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient has deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan includes continuing with anticoagulation therapy, monitoring for any bleeding complications, and adjusting the dosage as needed. The patient's advance diet will be advanced, and she will undergo further evaluation for potential causes of acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
2. Worsening of renal function or progression to end-stage renal disease.
3. Development of additional deep vein thrombosis or"

   long term in light of her heavy burden of metastasis disease.
   3.       ARF: Cr trending down, but to complete work up she should get
   a renal ultrasound to make sure there is not an obstructive component
   as she has had this complication in the past.
   4.       Resp Distress: DDX has been COPD and vol overload with concern

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of being on heparin for concern of pulmonary embolism (PE) and planning to transition to Lovenox due to cancer. The patient has tachycardia with systolic pressures in the 80's after receiving Lasix 20mg, and subsequent normal blood pressure but persistent tachycardia. The patient has allergies to Plavix and has been on various medications including pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia, and peripheral vascular examination is not assessed. The patient's respiratory support includes an O2 delivery device with SpO2 at 95%. The patient's ABG results are pending. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.1, slightly low hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, elevated potassium levels of 5.8 K/uL, and decreased platelet count of 88 K/uL. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated at 2.3, and troponin-T levels are within normal range at 0.16. The patient's other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic bladder cancer, new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and evidence of old deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). She has been tachycardic and hypoxemic with borderline values. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level remains stable, and there is no evidence of bleeding since transfer. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was negative for an acute bleed, but signs of ulceration in the esophagus are present, possibly due to steroid use. 

The patient continues to be tachycardic, possibly due to fluid status, although not responsive to fluid. There is concern for pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and she is on heparin therapy. Her leg edema is likely dependent edema due to DVTs, hypoalbuminemia, or lymphatic/vascular obstruction due to metastatic cancer. 

The patient has a history of bladder cancer and is currently undergoing palliative radiation. She also has hyperkalemia and acute-on-chronic renal failure, with an estimated creatinine clearance (Cr) of 29.0 mL/min. The patient's COPD is stable without signs of current exacerbation, and she has no evidence of pulmonary edema. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and her disposition is unknown."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with metastatic bladder cancer, who presented with new-onset upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed/Anemia: The patient had signs of an upper GI bleed, but an endoscopy was negative for active bleeding. However, there are signs of ulceration in the esophagus, likely due to steroid use. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) remains stable, indicating that the bleeding has stopped or is minimal. The plan is to transfuse if the Hct falls below 25 and continue IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
2. Venous Thromboembolus (PEs): The patient has evidence of old DVTs and is at risk for PEs. She is currently on heparin therapy, with a conservative activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 55-70. If chronic anticoagulation is pursued, Lovenox may be considered due to her history of malignancy. A CT chest may be considered when renal function improves.
3. Lower Extremity (LE) edema: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of bladder cancer, presenting with respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, and lower extremity clots. She is currently in the ICU and has been started on anticoagulation therapy. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 101/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She has diminished breath sounds in her chest, and her laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and renal failure. The patient is currently receiving IV heparin for her lower extremity DVT, pantoprazole for gastrointestinal bleeding, and being closely monitored for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to further blood loss and potential hypotension.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed lower extremity clots, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Further deterioration in renal function can occur if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may progress if underlying conditions such as COPD exacerbation or fluid overload are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of bladder cancer and gastrointestinal bleed.
- She is currently in the ICU and has experienced respiratory distress, possibly due to COPD, volume overload, and concern for pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity and acute renal failure.
- She is receiving systemic anticoagulation therapy with heparin, but there is a concern about the risk of bleeding considering her heavy burden of metastatic disease.
- The patient's platelet count is low, and there is suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It is planned to convert to Argatroban.
- Her arterial line was inserted on 12/29/2108 at 02:21 PM.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/37 to 83/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 91%, and temperature within normal range.
- The patient has received various medications, including Lasix, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole (Protonix).
- She has been given IV fluids and has received blood products.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and lactate, while her white blood cell count, platelet count, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with metastatic bladder cancer and a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to COPD, fluid overload, or a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/37 to 110/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her arterial line was started on December 29th at 2:21 pm and stopped on December 29th at 9:00 pm. She is receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole. The patient has a history of allergies to Plavix and a rash. She was given ciprofloxacin on December 29th at 12:40 pm. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. Her flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The physical examination reveals tachycardia and diminished breath sounds in the respiratory/chest examination. The patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli"
