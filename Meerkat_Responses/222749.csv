","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with delirium, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypotension of unclear etiology. The patient has a malignant pleural effusion due to ovarian cancer, for which a pleurex catheter was placed since June 23rd. She has poor oral intake at home.

The patient was admitted to the medical unit overnight and remained afebrile and stable. Her history could not be obtained due to encephalopathy. She has allergies to penicillins, influenza virus vaccines, iodine, and metronidazole.

She is currently receiving dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min, as well as other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, dopa, flagyl, and squill. Her medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except where noted above.

Flowsheet data shows that her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 mmHg to 108/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

She has been receiving fluid support, with a total input of 2,877 mL and output of 85 mL. Her blood products and urine output are also recorded. She is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing pH of 7.16.

Physical examination reveals that she is not well-nourished and thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and her peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable. Her respiratory and abdominal examinations are also unremarkable, while her extremities are cool and tender. Her neurologic examination shows that she is attentive and follows simple commands but is not oriented to time or place, with no movement or tone assessment.

Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, and sodium of 103 mg/dL. Her potassium levels are within normal range, but her calcium level is slightly low at 7.2 mg/dL. Imaging reveals streaky base opacity on chest X-ray. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a critically ill 78-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, presenting with subacute delirium and hypotension. She is being treated for possible sepsis, dehydration, and other etiologies such as pulmonary embolism or adrenal insufficiency."

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with delirium, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypotension of unclear etiology. The patient has a malignant pleural effusion due to ovarian cancer, for which a pleurex catheter was inserted on [**6-23**]. She has been unable to tolerate oral intake at home.

24-hour events include being sectioned, admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) overnight, remaining afebrile, and stable overnight. The patient's history was obtained from previous hospital records as she is unable to provide any history due to encephalopathy.

Allergies include penicillins, causing anaphylaxis, influenza virus vaccines resulting in arm swelling, and iodine causing pruritus. The patient received vancomycin on [**2127-7-11**] at 11:45 PM and metronidazole on [**2127-7-12**] at 07:48 AM.

The patient is currently receiving dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min and has been prophylaxed with heparin sodium. Other medications include dopa, flagyl, and subcutaneous heparin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. The patient presents with delirium, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is unclear at this time. Possible causes include severe volume depletion due to poor oral intake, medication effects, adrenal insufficiency from metastatic disease to the adrenal glands, or other factors. 

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV with a baseline creatinine level around 1.8. The ARF is likely prerenal in origin due to poor oral intake. Renal dose medications should be used, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.

3. Delirium: The etiology of the patient's delirium is unclear. Possible causes include uremia based on metabolic abnormalities, ingestions, metastatic disease to the brain, or hypoglycemia. IV fluid resuscitation, frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring, consideration of a head CT when stabilized, and avoiding known toxins are recommended.

4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap of 18, with elevated lactate levels and trace ketones in"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with delirium, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. 

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a positive urine analysis, but there is no evidence of sepsis as she is not tachycardic. The cause of her hypotension remains unclear. Potential causes include severe volume depletion, medication effects, adrenal insufficiency from metastasis to the adrenal glands, or an unknown etiology. An echocardiogram has been performed, ruling out pericardial effusion. 

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV with a baseline creatinine level around 1.8. Her current renal failure is likely prerenal in origin, resulting from poor oral intake. The patient's urine output is consistent with this diagnosis. Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended. 

The etiology of the patient's delirium is also unclear. It could be secondary to uremia based on metabolic abnormalities, or it could be due to other factors such as ingestions, metastatic disease to the brain, or hypoglycemia. The patient's fingerstick glucose levels should be monitored every four hours, and toxic screens should be considered. A CT scan of the head may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with delirium, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and has been receiving IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has been aggressive and wants to sign out against medical advice, refusing to admit that she is actually sick.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is unclear at this time. The patient has positive urine analysis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is no tachycardia or signs of sepsis. The patient's poor oral intake over the past week could suggest severe volume depletion, but again, tachycardia would be expected. The patient may be taking her antihypertensives inappropriately or extra ativan, leading to hypotension. Other possible causes include medication effects, adrenal insufficiency from metastasis to the adrenal glands, or pericardial eff"

She presents with delirium, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear at this time. The patient has positive urine analysis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there are no signs of sepsis.

Renal function is improving with intravenous fluids (IVFs), but the patient has a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level around 1.8. The patient's delirium may be secondary to uremia based on metabolic abnormalities. Anion gap acidosis is likely due to hypotension with mild hypoperfusion or tissue and starvation ketosis.

   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   .
   Hypotension.  Hypotension secondary to infection versus profound
   dehyration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  He has no
   positive culture data, but is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has ascites, but unable to sample this
   fluid.  Patient has been requiring high doses of pressors to support
   blood pressure.  Echo is pending.
   - vanco/aztreonam/flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - CT torso to look for source of infection
   - f/u echo
   .
   Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage IV
   with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine improved with fluids,
   but ongoing renal failure suggesting of worsening baseline or element
   of ATN.
   - hold off on further IVF boluses as patient is postiive 7 L [**Location **] renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   Altered mental status.  Patient was intiiatlly confused, but now more
   and more clear.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension, renal
   failure.  However, given metastatic ovarian ca without recent head
   imaging, will get head CT.
   - monitor mental status
   - head CT
   .
   Metabolic Acidosis.  Likely secondary to renal failure and massive
   saline infusions.
   - use LR if needs further boluses
   .
   Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   - notified [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2377**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9334**] of her arrival to MICU
   .
   Lower extremity edema.  Worsening LE in setting of IVFs.  Likely venous
   obstruction from tumor burden, but possibly thrombus.  Most recent
   LENIs negative.
   - consider LENIs in future

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confusion and hypotension, which could be secondary to hypovolemia or sepsis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole, due to lack of positive culture data but with suspicion of infection.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, as evidenced by an improvement in creatinine levels with intravenous fluid administration but ongoing renal failure suggesting worsening baseline or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is recommended to hold off further intravenous fluid boluses and avoid nephrotoxins.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, hypotension, and renal failure. However, given the patient's history of metastatic ovarian cancer without recent head imaging, a head computed tomography (CT) scan is planned to rule out any other causes of altered mental status.

Metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to renal failure and massive saline infusions. Use of lactated Ringer's (LR) solution for further boluses is recommended instead of normal saline.

Regarding the new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer, the patient has been informed about her condition and plans for future"

   -cont volume prn to keep urine output > 30 cc/hr.
   metabolic acidosis: in the setting of ns resuscitation. Probable anion
   gap and non gap acidosis (anion gap likely secondary to renal failure).
   Consider renal tubular acidosis as well as dilutional acidosis from
   volume resuscitation.
   -next bolus with LR or D5 with bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presented with confusion and hypotension and requires ongoing pressor support. The patient has shown improvement with aggressive fluids, antibiotics, and hemodynamic support. She is at risk for gastrointestinal pathology leading to sepsis, but her overall condition remains unclear. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 99/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

24-hour events include persistent pressor requirement despite aggressive fluids, ongoing goals of care discussion, no evidence of hydro, improvedmentation, and pending test results. The patient has allergies to penicillins, influenza virus vaccines, iodine, and iodine-containing products. She received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. 

The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion and has other ICU medications such as heparin sodium. The patient's medical, social, and family history is unchanged from admission except for the recent diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. Review of systems reveals fatigue, dry mouth, no chest pain, palpitations, edema, or tachycardia. 

Flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presented with confusion and hypotension and now requires persistent pressor support. The patient's overall condition has improved with fluids, antibiotics, and hemodynamic support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal pathology leading to sepsis due to her recent new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. Her current treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics (vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole) for a two-week course unless new information arises. Additionally, a vre swab will be assessed to determine the need for linezolid.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has significant metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology. In the setting of nonsurvival resuscitation, the next bolus with lactated Ringer's (LR) or D5 with bicarb will be given.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF on CKD is resolving, although she is still oliguric. It may be related to abdominal compression. Continuous volume as needed will be provided.

4. Confusion: The patient's confusion is resolving, and a head CT will be done as part of ICU care.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis for DVT has been initiated with subcutaneous"

   Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage IV
   with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine improved with fluids,
   but ongoing renal failure suggesting of worsening baseline or element
   of ATN.
   - hold off on further IVF boluses as patient is postiive 7 L [**Location **] renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   Altered mental status.  Patient was intiiatlly confused, but now more
   and more clear.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension, renal
   failure.  However, given metastatic ovarian ca without recent head
   imaging, will get head CT.
   - monitor mental status
   - head CT
   .
   Metabolic Acidosis.  Likely secondary to renal failure and massive
   saline infusions.
   - Give D5 as needed
   .
   Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   - notified [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2377**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9334**] of her arrival to MICU

   Lower extremity edema.  Worsening LE in setting of IVFs.  Likely venous
   obstruction from tumor burden, but possibly thrombus.  Most recent
   LENIs negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. The patient was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which were initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia or sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 78/38 mmHg, which indicates hypotension. The heart rate is within normal limits at 66 bpm. The respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal at 36.6 degrees Celsius.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole), anticoagulation with heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole. The patient also has a PICC line in place.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 18,000/uL, likely due to infection or inflammation. The hemoglobin level is low at 9.1 g/dL, and the platelet count is slightly below normal at 74,000/uL. Renal function tests show impaired kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but there is evidence of metabolic acidosis with a TCO2 level of "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage and is being closely monitored for infection. She also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with an improvement in creatinine levels but ongoing renal failure. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection, hypotension, and renal failure. A head CT has been ordered to further evaluate her condition. The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to renal failure and massive saline infusions. She has a new diagnosis of widespread metastatic ovarian cancer and is being informed about future treatment options. Lower extremity edema is present, which may be caused by venous obstruction from tumor burden or a possible thrombus. The patient has been counseled about her condition, and a code status of DNR/DNI has been established. She is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which could be secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. There are no positive culture data available yet. An echo is pending to assess for any cardiac abnormalities.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a baseline creatinine level around 1.8. The creatinine has improved with fluids, but there is ongoing renal failure, which could be due to worsening of the baseline condition or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, hypotension, and renal failure. However, given her metastatic ovarian cancer without recent head imaging, a head CT has been ordered.

The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure and massive saline infusions. It is recommended to use lactated Ringer's (LR) if further boluses are needed.

In terms of management, the patient's code status is full code, and she is currently unable to leave against medical advice (AMA). The disposition is pending clinical improvement.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the note mentions several significant events that occurred within the 24-hour period starting from 05:23 AM on 2127-07-14.

The arterial line stopped at 05:23 AM. The patient was weaned off of pressors and showed improvement in mental status. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and torso was considered to evaluate for meningitis (MS) as well as the source of possible infection, but it was decided against due to cleared MS.

The patient has bilateral leg swelling, and iron studies/haptoglobin have been ordered. The patient also presented with dark stool, which was guaiac-positive, and a repeat hematocrit (HCT) test was performed. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been ordered.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, causing anaphylaxis, influenza virus vaccines resulting in arm swelling, and iodine products causing pruritus. The last doses of antibiotics given were ciprofloxacin on 2127-07-12 at 09:17 AM, vancomycin at 12:30 PM on the same day, aztreonam at 12:00 AM on 2127-07-14, and metronidazole at 12:36 AM on the same day.

The patient is receiving heparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis and pantopraz"

   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension secondary to infection versus profound
   dehyration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  He has no
   positive culture data, but is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has ascites, but unable to sample this
   fluid.  Patient has been requiring high doses of pressors to support
   blood pressure.  Echo is pending.
   - cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal course, 7
   day course
   - f/u culture data
   - will defer CT torso for now given patient
s improvement
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine improved with
   fluids, but ongoing renal failure suggesting of worsening baseline or
   element of ATN.
   - continue fluid boluses as needed as needed though patient is postiive
   7L [**Location **] [**Location **] dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - recheck bladder pressure
   - will defer renal consult for now
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   and more clear.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension, renal
   failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - will defer head CT for now
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  Likely secondary to renal failure and massive
   saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH.
   - Give D5 as needed
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.
   - notified [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2377**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9334**] of her arrival to MICU; they will
   see her today
   - will check lipase, amylase, uric acid
   # Lower extremity edema.  Worsening LE in setting of IVFs.  Likely
   venous obstruction from tumor burden, but possibly thrombus.  Most
   recent LENIs negative.
   - F/U LENIs today

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. The patient was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which were initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis. The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (78/38 mmHg), heart rate (66 bpm), respiratory rate (12 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (100% on nasal cannula). The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for presumed intra-abdominal infection, as well as fluids and pressors to support blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure, with an elevated creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low calcium and magnesium levels, and elevated lactate acid and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient also has metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level.

The patient has lower extremity edema, which is worsening, and there is a concern for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the tumor burden. The patient's mental status has improved over time, and there are plans to defer imaging studies such as a head CT and torso CT for now.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and change in mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/36 mmHg to 78/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient has received various antibiotics and is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications. She has been monitored closely with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances, such as low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), but normal calcium (Ca++) and phosphate (PO4) levels. Liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are slightly elevated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with hypotension and change in mental status. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized but remains low, and she is experiencing oliguria (reduced urine output) with persistent renal dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to her underlying cancer or other causes such as peptic ulcer disease.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient initially presented with a change in mental status, indicating possible delirium or confusion. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or metabolic imbalances.

3. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low but stable, indicating hypotension. This could be attributed to factors such as sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguria and persistent renal dysfunction, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be caused by factors like dehydration, sepsis, or direct kidney injury from medications or procedures.

5. Shock/Sepsis: Although there is no clear source identified, the patient is at risk for shock and sepsis due to her hypotension, altered mental status, and ongoing renal dysfunction. These conditions require prompt management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with hypotension and change in mental status. The patient is currently experiencing low but stable blood pressure, oliguria, and persistent renal dysfunction. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as gastrointestinal bleed, delirium/confusion, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/36 mmHg to 78/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, as well as low levels of platelets, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear lungs, and soft abdomen with minimally tender masses. However, there are concerns about potential issues related to her cancer, including shock, sepsis, and renal failure.

The assessment and plan include continuing antibiotics, providing fluids, checking amylase and lipase levels, addressing acute renal failure, evaluating urine output and electrolytes, considering input from renal specialists, monitoring bladder pressure, and discussing the patient's prognosis and potential hospice care if acute issues persist.

In summary, the potential medical complications that can"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with hypotension and change in mental status. The patient's current condition shows low but stable blood pressure, oliguria (low urine output), and persistent renal dysfunction. There are concerns of possible shock and sepsis, although no clear source has been identified. 

The patient has been on antibiotics for a total of seven days, and her fluid status remains borderline. The plan is to continue with antibiotics, monitor the patient's blood pressure and urine output, and reassess the situation. Further tests such as amylase, lipase, uric acid, urine electrolytes, and a bladder pressure check are recommended. The patient may require input from the renal team, and a bladder pressure and abdominal ultrasound will be done to rule out tappable ascites related to cancer. 

Considering the patient's prognosis and acute issues persisting, hospice may be considered as an option. The patient is in the ICU with ongoing nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). The patient remains critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has a history of ovarian tumor and is currently on heparin for bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). She also has elevated uric acid levels, which Oncology does not expect from ovarian tumor. The patient's bladder pressure is 18 mmHg, and she is unable to address concerns about her condition at the current time. Her vancomycin levels are at 18.2, and her urine output has improved with D5 HCO3, with creatinine trending down. She is experiencing diarrhea, and a test for Clostridium difficile toxin has been ordered. The patient has allergies to penicillins, anaphylaxis, influenza virus vaccines, iodine, and pruritus. She received her last dose of antibiotics on day 4. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and pantoprazole (Protonix). There are no changes to her medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged except for the new development of diarrhea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 92/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 90 kg,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no positive culture data have been obtained so far. The patient's blood pressure requires high doses of pressors to be maintained.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern and may be secondary to infection or profound dehydration in the setting of a new diagnosis of malignancy. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure are necessary.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine around 1.8. Despite fluid resuscitation, her renal function has worsened, suggesting either a worsening baseline or an element of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid management should be cautious, avoiding nephrotoxins, and rechecking bladder pressure is recommended.

3. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with confusion, which is now improving. The altered mental status may be secondary to infection, hypotension, renal failure, or a combination of these factors. Monitoring the patient's mental status is crucial.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient presents with hypotension and altered mental status. They have been diagnosed with bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and are currently receiving heparin. Their uric acid levels are elevated at 13.0 mg/dL. The patient is unable to address concerns about their care at the current time. Their vancomycin level is 18.2, and their urine output has improved with the administration of D5 HCO3, with creatinine trending down. Diarrhea is also present, and testing for Clostridium difficile toxin has been ordered.

Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral DVT. This condition involves blood clots forming in the deep veins, typically in the legs. If left untreated, DVT can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient may be experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and other laboratory abnormalities. Gastrointestinal bleeding can result in significant blood loss and can be potentially life-threatening.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium or confusion, as mentioned in the assessment and plan section of the progress note. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of confusion, disorientation, and fluctuations in consciousness."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has moderate ascites, but unable to sample
   this fluid.  Norepinepherine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has
   been stable with periodic fluid boluses since this time, though she is
   now approximately 12 L positive.
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal course, 10
   day course (now Day #4)
   - f/u culture data
   - Continue periodic fluid boluses with D5 with HCO3.
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs performed yesterday, which showed
   bilateral DVTs.  She was started on heparin gtt.
    - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**], as this has shown to be superior
   anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine improved overnight
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1).  DDx
   includes worsening baseline v ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed as needed
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Will defer renal consult for now
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg PO/IM prn for agitation
   - Defer CT head until patient
s Cr has returned to baseline.
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  Likely secondary to renal failure and massive
   saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH.
   - Give D5 as needed
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc yesterday, who
   recommended deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and
   patient is no longer hypotensive.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which could be secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis.

The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and started on heparin gtt. Her uric acid levels are elevated at 13.0, which is not necessarily expected from ovarian tumors according to Oncology. The patient's bladder pressure is rechecked at 18 mmHg. She has an allergy history including penicillins, anaphylaxis, influenza virus vaccines, iodine, and pruritus. 

Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole on days 4 and 5. She is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/40 to 93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of 20.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis. The patient has moderate ascites but unable to sample this fluid. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed intra-abdominal infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate hypovolemia or sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVTs): The patient has bilateral DVTs as shown by lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS). She is currently receiving heparin therapy for anticoagulation. The plan is to change to Lovenox if her creatinine stabilizes, as it is superior for cancer patients.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8. Her creatinine improved overnight with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses. It is important to continue fluid boluses as needed, dose medications based on renal function, avoid nephrotoxins, and obtain a renal consult.

4. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient initially presented with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer, presenting with profound hypotension and suspected sepsis. The patient also has acute renal failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in both lower extremities. The patient's delirium seems to be improving. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, periodic fluid boluses, and heparin for the DVT. The plan includes discussing kidney function and further diagnostic work-up with a renal specialist, as well as a head CT to assess the patient's mental status. The patient's family will be contacted for a consensus on goals of care. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and suspected sepsis indicate a potential complication of infection spreading throughout the body, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's oliguric ARF suggests impaired kidney function, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially life-threatening condition where a blood clot from the leg travels to the lungs.
4. Delirium: The patient's"

   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has moderate ascites, but unable to sample
   this fluid.  Norepinepherine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has
   been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19 L positive in the
   setting of minimal uop.  [**2127-7-15**] restarted Norepinephrine
   - New leukocytosis o/n to 18.4, monitor for fever or other localizing
   source and culture as appropriate
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal course, 10
   day course (now day #5)
   - f/u culture data (NGTD)
   - Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low dose
   Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min)
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with rapidly increased leukocytosis this AM to
   18+.  No new localizing source of infection.  Not on steroids.
   Cultures with NGTD.
   - Monitor for localizing symptoms
   - Send C.diff if loose stool
   - Send UA
   - Blood culture if febrile; CXR if symptomatic or worsened oxygenation
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs, which showed bilateral DVTs.  She was
   started on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] if Cr stabilizes, as this has shown
   to be superior anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1).  DDx
   includes worsening baseline v ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Now
   continuing to worsen with minimal uop.
   - started on pressor for increased flow to kidneys
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow-up renal recs
   - Monitor ionized calcium
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to renal failure
   and massive saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH. AG likely
   multiple contributing factors including mild uremia, possibly lactate.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
    Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc yesterday, who
   recommended deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and
   patient is no longer hypotensive.
    - Continue to follow Heme/Onc recs

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was thought to be secondary to infection versus profound dehydration in the setting of a new diagnosis of malignancy. She is being broadly covered with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl. Norepinephrine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19 L positive in the setting of minimal urine output. On [**2127-7-15**], norepinephrine was restarted.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient had lower extremity edema and increased leg swelling, which showed bilateral DVTs. She was started on heparin gtt.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of COPD and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulation therapy and the potential complications associated with malignancy.

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient initially presented with confusion and altered mental status, which is likely secondary to infection,"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has moderate ascites, but unable to sample
   this fluid.  Norepinepherine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has
   been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19 L positive in the
   setting of minimal uop.  [**2127-7-15**] restarted Norepinephrine
   - New leukocytosis o/n to 18.4, monitor for fever or other localizing
   source and culture as appropriate
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal course, 10
   day course (now day #5)
   - f/u culture data (NGTD)
   - Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low dose
   Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min)
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with rapidly increased leukocytosis this AM to
   18+.  No new localizing source of infection.  Not on steroids.
   Cultures with NGTD.
   - Monitor for localizing symptoms
   - Send C.diff if loose stool
   - Send UA
   - Blood culture if febrile; CXR if symptomatic or worsened oxygenation
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs, which showed bilateral DVTs.  She was
   started on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] if Cr stabilizes, as this has shown
   to be superior anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1).  DDx
   includes worsening baseline v ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Now
   continuing to worsen with minimal uop.
   - started on pressor for increased flow to kidneys
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow-up renal recs
   - Monitor ionized calcium
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to renal failure
   and massive saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH. AG likely
   multiple contributing factors including mild uremia, possibly lactate.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc yesterday, who
   recommended deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and
   patient is no longer hypotensive.
    - Continue to follow Heme/Onc recs
   - Plan for family meeting on Saturday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which were initially thought to be secondary to infection or profound dehydration. The patient has moderate ascites but unable to sample this fluid. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole) for presumed intra-abdominal infection. The patient's condition has been stable with periodic fluid boluses, but she became 19 liters positive in the setting of minimal urine output.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/45 to 123/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, normal skin, and unassessed neurologic status.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 33.5 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, low sodium of 117 mEq/L, high potassium of 5.1 mEq/L, and low hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL. Imaging reveals no"

   Chief Complaint: Altered mental status
   24 Hour Events:
   - Heme/Onc had no new recommendations.  Defer on chemotherapy for now.
   - Psych reassessed patient.  Improved mental status, but may not
   necessarily have the capacity to make decisions regarding treatment at
   present.  Call if any question of leaving.  Recommended Haldol for
   agitation.
   - Spoke to nephew: [**Name (NI) **] will be in town on Saturday.  Until this time, no
   procedures which will cause pain to the patient (i.e. HD), and no
   escalation of care.  As long as patient is stable until Saturday,
   family meeting will occur when he's in town.
   - Renal consulted: agreed with starting Levophed to increase UOP.  Also
   recommended limiting IVFs, check ionized Ca, stop bicarb until Ca is
   corrected, Stop Maalox
   - Ordered HgA1c, as patient's sugars have been high but not on SSI: 6.1
   - UOP on Levo didn't increase.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be secondary to infection versus profound dehydration in the setting of a new diagnosis of malignancy. No positive culture data have been obtained to date, but she is being broadly covered with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. She has moderate ascites, but unable to sample this fluid. Norepinephrine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19 L positive in the setting of minimal uop. On [**2127-7-15**], norepinephrine was restarted.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a new leukocytosis of 18.4, monitor for fever or other localizing source and culture as appropriate. The patient is currently on a broad spectrum antibiotic regimen.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVTs): The patient had lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) which showed bilateral DVTs. She was started on heparin gtt."

   Chief Complaint: Altered mental status
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Heme/Onc had no new recommendations.  Defer on chemotherapy for now.
   - Psych reassessed patient.  Improved mental status, but may not
   necessarily have the capacity to make decisions regarding treatment at
   present.  Call if any question of leaving.  Recommended Haldol for
   agitation.
   - Spoke to nephew: [**Name (NI) **] will be in town on Saturday.  Until this time, no
   procedures which will cause pain to the patient (i.e. HD), and no
   escalation of care.  As long as patient is stable until Saturday,
   family meeting will occur when he's in town.
   - Renal consulted: agreed with starting Levophed to increase UOP.  Also
   recommended limiting IVFs, check ionized Ca, stop bicarb until Ca is
   corrected, Stop Maalox
   - Ordered HgA1c, as patient's sugars have been high but not on SSI: 6.1
   - UOP on Levo didn't increase.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with profound hypotension, bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), oliguric acute kidney injury (ATN), and delirium/confusion. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the past few days, with worsening hypotension, new hypothermia, and leukocytosis.

The patient is currently receiving continuous support with pressors and is being treated with antibiotics for an unknown source of infection. However, considering her recent diagnosis of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) and potential fungal infection, the plan is to expand the antibiotic coverage to include VRE and fungus.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been initiated for acute renal failure (ARF)/ATN, as per the goals of care discussed with the nephew. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and measures are being taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is anxious, with no acute distress.

Physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema, distended abdomen, and warm skin without rash or ja"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She presents with profound hypotension, bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and oliguric acute kidney injury (ATN). The patient's condition has led to several potential medical complications.

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral DVTs, which indicates a blood clot in both lower extremities. This is a serious condition that can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if the clots dislodge and travel to the lungs.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be caused by various factors such as peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, or colorectal cancer. It is important to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be a result of multiple factors including infection, medication side effects, or metabolic disturbances. It is crucial to assess and manage the underlying cause to improve the patient's mental status.

4. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient has profound hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, volume depletion, or other causes. It is important to optimize fluid resuscitation and consider the use of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  Patient with increasing leukocytosis and
   hypothermia yesterday; thus started on Micafungin.  U/A appears dirty,
   but no culture data to date.  Norepi was restarted on [**7-15**] to increase
   UOP, but patient has remained on this to date.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and search for localized source of
   infection
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl (Day #5) and Micafungin (Day #2)  for
   presumed intra-abdominal course, 10 day course
   - f/u culture data (NGTD)
   - Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low dose
   Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min)
   - F/U Cdiff cultures
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs, which showed bilateral DVTs.  She was
   started on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] if Cr stabilizes, as this has shown
   to be superior anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1); however,
   now increased to 2.9.  Renal was consulted, and patient was found to
   have muddy brown casts in U/A.  Aztreonam was decreased yesterday, and
   she has continued on Norepi for increased renal perfusion.
   - Continue Norepi to improve renal perfusion.
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor ionized calcium (normal today)
   - Concentrate fluids as much as possible.
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Haldol PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to lactic
   acidosis.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc, who recommended
   deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and patient is no
   longer hypotensive.
    - Continue to follow Heme/Onc recs
    - Plan for family meeting on Saturday

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine infusion. This may be due to infection, profound dehydration, or hypovolemia.

2. Infection: The patient has increasing leukocytosis, hypothermia, and a ""dirty"" urinalysis. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole) and antifungal medication (micafungin) for presumed intra-abdominal infection.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral DVTs, for which she is receiving heparin. It is planned to switch to low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) if her creatinine levels stabilize.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, with an increase in creatinine from 2.1 to 2.9. She has muddy brown casts in her urinalysis. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  She has moderate ascites, but unable to sample
   this fluid.  Norepinepherine was weaned on [**2127-7-13**], and the patient has
   been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19 L positive in the
   setting of minimal uop.  [**2127-7-15**] restarted Norepinephrine
   - New leukocytosis o/n to 18.4, monitor for fever or other localizing
   source and culture as appropriate
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal course, 10
   day course (now day #5)
   - f/u culture data (NGTD)
   - Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low dose
   Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min)
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with rapidly increased leukocytosis this AM to
   18+.  No new localizing source of infection.  Not on steroids.
   Cultures with NGTD.
   - Monitor for localizing symptoms
   - Send C.diff if loose stool
   - Send UA
   - Blood culture if febrile; CXR if symptomatic or worsened oxygenation
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs, which showed bilateral DVTs.  She was
   started on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] if Cr stabilizes, as this has shown
   to be superior anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1).  DDx
   includes worsening baseline v ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Now
   continuing to worsen with minimal uop.
   - started on pressor for increased flow to kidneys
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow-up renal recs
   - Monitor ionized calcium
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to renal failure
   and massive saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH. AG likely
   multiple contributing factors including mild uremia, possibly lactate.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc yesterday, who
   recommended deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and
   patient is no longer hypotensive.
    - Continue to follow Heme/Onc recs
   - Plan for family meeting on Saturday

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis. The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which is thought to be secondary to infection versus profound dehydration in the setting of a new diagnosis of malignancy. Broad coverage with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl has been initiated, but no positive culture data have been obtained to date.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has rapidly increased leukocytosis this morning to 18.4. No new localizing source of infection has been identified. Cultures with NGTD are pending.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of CKD stage IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8. Creatinine initially improved with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1). Now, it is continuing to worsen with minimal urine output.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVTs): The patient had lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS), which showed bilateral DVTs. She was started on heparin gtt and will continue with this anticoagulation therapy. Considering changing to Lovenox [**"

   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1).  DDx
   includes worsening baseline v ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Now

   - Psych recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to renal failure
   and massive saline infusions.  Also with elevated LDH. AG likely
   multiple contributing factors including mild uremia, possibly lactate.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc yesterday, who
   recommended deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia versus sepsis.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's hypotension is thought to be secondary to infection versus profound dehydration in the setting of a new diagnosis of malignancy.
- She has moderate ascites but unable to sample this fluid.
- She is being broadly covered with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl.
- Norepinephrine was weaned on [2127-7-13], and the patient has been stable with periodic fluid boluses but became 19L positive in the setting of minimal uop.
- She restarted Norepinephrine on [2127-7-15].
- New leukocytosis overnight to 18.4, monitor for fever or other localizing source and culture as appropriate.
- Continue vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl for presumed intra-abdominal source, 10-day course (now day #5).
- Follow-up culture data (NGTD).
- Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low-dose Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min).
- The patient has rapidly increased leukocytosis this AM to 18+. No new localizing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with hypotension and ovarian cancer. She has worsened leukocytosis, hypothermia, and increased pressor requirement. Cultures were taken, and the patient is being treated with Micafungin for suspected gut translocation. Renal recommendations include decreasing Aztreonam dosing. The patient is experiencing mild delirium and has a decreased appreciation of her medical situation. Pharmacy maximally concentrated all meds to minimize fluids, except for Norepinephrine. Oncology notes that chemotherapy is not currently possible due to the patient's instability in the ICU and inability to obtain consent. Lactate levels are rising, indicating possible worsening of the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a known DVT in the lower extremity, which is a blood clot that can lead to serious complications if it dislodges and travels to the lungs or other organs.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening and may require urgent intervention.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is displaying signs of delirium and confusion, which can be a result of various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or organ dysfunction.

4. Hypotension (Not in Shock): The patient's persistent hypotension indicates inadequate blood flow and perf"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian
   cancer admitted with confusion and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia
   versus sepsis.
   # Hypotension.  Hypotension thought to be secondary to infection versus
   profound dehydration in setting of new diagnosis of malignancy.  No
   positive culture data to date, but she is being broadly covered with
   vanco/aztreonam/flagyl.  Patient with increasing leukocytosis and
   hypothermia yesterday; thus started on Micafungin.  U/A appears dirty,
   but no culture data to date.  Norepi was restarted on [**7-15**] to increase
   UOP, but patient has remained on this to date.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and search for localized source of
   infection
   - Cont vanco/aztreonam/flagyl (Day #5) and Micafungin (Day #2)  for
   presumed intra-abdominal course, 10 day course
   - f/u culture data (NGTD)
   - Stopped fluid boluses as 19L positive; continue with low dose
   Norepinephrine (currently 0.16mcg/kg/min)
   - F/U Cdiff cultures
   # DVTs:  The patient had LENIs, which showed bilateral DVTs.  She was
   started on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - Consider changing to Lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] if Cr stabilizes, as this has shown
   to be superior anticoagulation for cancer patients.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of CKD stage
   IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.  Creatinine initially improved
   with periodic D5 with HCO3 fluid boluses (from 2.4 to 2.1); however,
   now increased to 2.9.  Renal was consulted, and patient was found to
   have muddy brown casts in U/A.  Aztreonam was decreased yesterday, and
   she has continued on Norepi for increased renal perfusion.
   - Continue Norepi to improve renal perfusion.
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor ionized calcium (normal today)
   # Altered mental status.  Patient was initiatlly confused, but now more
   alert and oriented.  AMS likely secondary to infection, hypotension,
   renal failure, and now resolving.
   - monitor mental status
   - Psych recommended Haldol PO/IM prn for agitation
   # Metabolic Acidosis.  +Anion gap.  Likely secondary to lactic
   acidosis.
   - Monitor
   - VBG with lactate
   # Ovarian Cancer.  Patient has new diagnosis of widespread metastatic
   ovarian cancer and is saddened by this.  Plan for treatment in future.
   Also with elevated LDH.  She was seen by Heme/Onc, who recommended
   deferring chemotherapy until infection is resolved and patient is no
   longer hypotensive.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted with confusion and hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 95.5°F (36°C), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/52 to 73/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of up to 19.3 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal dysfunction.
- The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole, as well as antifungal treatment with micafungin.
- Imaging studies show evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) in both legs, for which she has been initiated on heparin therapy.
- Renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine levels and the presence of muddy brown casts in the urinalysis.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated between confusion and alertness, possibly due to a combination of factors such as infection, hypotension, renal failure, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic ovarian vs. primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma. She presented with severe hypotension, likely sepsis but with an unidentified source, and aneuric renal failure likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's vital signs show persistent hypotension and signs of poor perfusion. Her respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is not in acute distress, overweight/obese, and has cool skin. There is evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. The neurological assessment is incomplete as the patient did not cooperate with certain tests. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 374. Other lab values show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment, as well as elevated lactate levels and lactic acidosis. Imaging reveals small bilateral effusions on chest X-ray. 

The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleed, delirium/confusion, hypotension, and acute renal failure. 

The plan of care includes continuing pressor support without escalation, continuing antibiotics, continuing heparin, no dialysis, minimizing lab checks, providing nutrition as tolerated, maintaining glycemic control"
