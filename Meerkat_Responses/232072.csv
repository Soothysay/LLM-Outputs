   will follow up with radiology final read.
   Microbiology: Reported negative results from OSH outside of
   C. Diff positive at OSH
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo female who is s/p cardiac arrest and has history of SVT,
   extensive DVT and arterial clot complicated by PE and splenic infarct
   who had recent admission for PE and concern for HIT but was HIT Ab
   negative.  She, at home, had some decreased activity and then at 4am
   had dyspnea, LOC and EMS arrived and had defibrillation and return of
   pulse and had return of spontaneous rhythm.  CTA there had no PE but
   tachycardia persisted and Amiodarone started with hypotension supported
   with Neosynephrine IV.  Vanco/Zosyn started for fever and C. Diff found
   in stool sample.  Furthermore, patient had no sedation given following
   inbutation but with only withdrawl response to pain and eye opening to
   voice following arrest on [**2-11**].  In that setting patient with small SAH
   noted and argatroban stopped.  Head CT with severe atrophy but
   relatively little evidence of anoxic brain injury.  Multiple active
   issues with some significant interaction to be managed as follows-->
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with MMV and will decrease rate to 6
   -Mental status is primary barrier to extubation and will support.
   2)Altered Mental Status/SAH-
   -Some improvement in exam across time, no clear discrete evidence of
   significant edema.  She has sedation  with-held and has shown
   improvement across initial 72 hours.
   -No cooling performed
   -She has small SAH with N-[**Doctor First Name **] input defining it as small and unlikely
   to drive impaired mental status.
   3)Tachycardia-NSVT
likely re-entrant tachycardia noted and with trigger
   into tachycardia
prominent V-waves noted and clear decrease in SBP to
   94.  With return to SR patient has clearly evolved normal A-wave,
   V-wave morphology.  This would suggest that the presence of the
   re-entrant rhythm actually has substantial impact on effective stroke
   volume
   -EP to aid in evaluation and continue to prescribe meds/procedures to
   control
   -Continue  with Amiodarone
   -Needs to maintain sinus rhythm
   4)C. Diff-
   -po vanco to continue
   -Will have to discuss with ID
   5)Sepsis/Hypotension-
   -Continued on Neo IV---discontinued this morning with BP stabilized
   -On Hydrocortisone 50mg q 8
   -Follow up cultures for possible addition of antibiotics
   -Follow up C. Diff cultures
   6)SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)-
   -N-[**Doctor First Name 91**] review of CT scan helpful, clear bias towards anti-coagulation
   given extensive clot and PE history and tenuous hemodynamic status with
   unstable arrhythmia
   -Will anticoagulate with Argatroban to goal PTT-2x upper limit
   -Creatinine is normal
   -Will start when INR <2.0
   -Will need to follow exam and CT in am
   7)Hypercoagulable State/DVT-
   -Will consult Heme to aid in choices of anticoagulation and
   consideration of causes
   -Will pursue Argatroban for anticoagulation in the setting of extensive
   clot

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of cardiac arrest, SVT, extensive DVT, arterial clot, PE, and splenic infarct. She had a recent admission for PE and concern for HIT but was negative for HIT antibodies. The patient experienced decreased activity at home, followed by dyspnea and loss of consciousness, leading to defibrillation and return of spontaneous rhythm. She is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has a C. diff infection, altered mental status, Junctional Tachycardia, sepsis, and a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mental status is a primary barrier to extubation, indicating the need for continued respiratory support.
2. Altered Mental Status/SAH: Despite improvement in the exam across time, the patient's mental status remains impaired due to the SAH. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
3. Tachycardia-NSVT: The patient has a re-entrant tachycardia that needs to be controlled. An electrophysiologist (EP) evaluation is recommended to aid in the evaluation and prescribe medications/procedures to control the tachycardia.
4. C. Diff: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which requires ongoing treatment and discussion with an infectious disease"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which have been managed with amiodarone. The patient also has a history of allergy to erythromycin base and heparin agents.

The patient's most recent echocardiogram shows severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 20%, but when the heart rate is controlled, there is improved function of the basal segments. There is also noted apical aneurysm consistent with a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct pattern distribution, resulting in an overall ejection fraction of 25-30%. Additionally, there is mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

A head CT scan reveals linear foci of high attenuation in the left frontal region, which may represent small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate ranging from 146 to 154 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/69 to 149/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, with total fluid intake of 2920 mL and output of 1925 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 469, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 5.3 L/min, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 64.

The patient's physical examination findings include distant heart sounds, clear chest with crackles at the base, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and decreased distal pulses. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) level, decreased platelet count (Plt), normal creatinine (Cr) level, elevated troponin-T level, low total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level, and normal glucose level. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include cardiac dysrhythmia, Clostridium difficile infection, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient is receiving various ICU care measures, including fibrous nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. He was found to have a large anterior wall myocardial infarction with apical aneurysm, severe global hypokinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%. The patient was resuscitated and intubated, and is currently in the ICU for further management. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to experience episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient has a history of allergy to erythromycin base, rash from heparin agents, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving amiodarone and argatroban infusions, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new onset of confusion and difficulty with movement. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. He has also had multiple episodes of hypotension and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of a large anterior wall myocardial infarction with apical aneurysm puts him at risk for ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, who was admitted to the ICU with severe global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction less than 20%. The patient continues to convert into supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), then back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). He has undergone several interventions, including the placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, removal of a right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter, and initiation of amiodarone therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's ongoing conversion into SVT and back to NSR indicates a potential for cardiac dysrhythmia. This can lead to hemodynamic instability and may require further management with antiarrhythmic medications or other interventions.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications and may necessitate platelet transfusion or other interventions to maintain adequate platelet levels.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction. AKI can occur due to various factors such as hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic drugs, or sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Infection: The presence of C."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo female with SVT, extensive clot burden (aortic, PE,
   splenic infart), here s/p cardiac arrest now intubated, with SVT and
   hypotension.
   .
   1.  S/p Cardiac arrest.  Unclear precipitant of arrest.  Was reportedly
   in a shockable rhythmn upon EMS arrival, so possible ventricular
   arrythmia in the setting of being on quinidine and having a prolonged
   qtc interval (>650) on one EKG at OSH.  Also possibilitiy of SVT with
   hypotension given history of unstable SVT.  Cardiac enzymes were not
   significantly elevated at OSH so not likely to be acute MI.  Echo
   follow arrest showed EF fell to 20-25 from 45% two weeks ago.
   - F/u EP recs: cont amiodarone
   - serial EKGs
   .
   2.  SVT.  Patient has narrow complex tachycardia with no clear p waves,
   possibly AVNRT.  Started on amiodarone and neo, but had been discharged
   2 weeks ago with quinidine and metoprolol.  Reportly normotensive when
   in sinus rhythm.  Echo shows reduced EF from prior echo from 3 weeks
   ago concerning for ischemia versus tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
   - continue amiodarone
   - IVF boluses as CVP low when in NSR
   - F/u EP recs as above
   - hold quinidine
   .
   3. Altered mental status.  Patient has reportedly been off sedation for
   two days, now with some improvement of her neuro exam per OSH.
   Currently opens eyes to name, PERRL, withdraws to noxious stimuli, but
   does not follow commands.  AMS likely multifactorial due to anoxic
   brain injury, new findings of SAH, toxic-metabolic in setting of C.
   diff infection, and baseline generalized atrophy. Repeat head CT
   stable.
   - PO vanco for C. diff
   - Serial head CT for SAH evolution while on argatroban
   - Consider neuro consult
   - no sedation
   - consider repeat EEG
   - neurosurg c/s for safety of using anticoagulation with small SAH
   .
   4.  Hypotension.  Per OSH, when in sinus rhythm not hypotensive, so
   hypotension is likely secondary to tachycardia.  Also likely an element
   of hypovolemia in setting of lasix diuresis at OSH and ongoing C.
   diff.  Will also evaluate for other infectious sources.  Given clot
   burden, concern for recurrent PE, though CTA of chest reportedly
   negative from OSH and was therapeutic on coumadin on arrival to OSH.
   - IVF
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - monitor urine output
   .
   5.  Extensive clot burden.  Patient has extensive clot burden likely
   presumed secondary to HIT, though HIT negative x 2.  Found to have
   large PE, splenic infarcts, large aortic thrombus.  No history of
   malignancy.
   - no heparin products
   - check HIT/SRA given high prob
   - heme consult re: dx of hit in setting of two negative HAB
   .
   6.  C. diff.  Found today to have C. diff and has ongoing diarrhea.
   - PO vanco
   .
   7.  Hyponatremia.  Likely hypovolemic in setting of C. diff and
   diuresis at OSH.
   - follow Na
   - IVF bolus
   .
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: cannot get subcutaneous heparin due to HIT, pneumoboots,
   PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), extensive clot burden (aortic, PE, splenic infarct), and previous cardiac arrest. She was found to have C. difficile infection, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. S/p Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, possibly due to ventricular arrhythmia related to quinidine use and prolonged QT interval. There is also a possibility of SVT with hypotension.

2. SVT: The patient has a narrow complex tachycardia with no clear P waves, possibly AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia). She is currently on amiodarone and neo, but previously discharged with quinidine and metoprolol. The reduced ejection fraction (EF) from prior echo is concerning for ischemia versus tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has been off sedation for two days and shows some improvement in neuro exam. However, she remains AMS (altered mental status) likely due to anoxic brain injury, new findings of SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage), toxic-metabolic in the setting of C. diff infection, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo female now admit with cardiac arrest in the setting of Quinidine
   and now with d/c of agents has shown substantial improvement in
   hemodynamics with volume replacement.  She has had some intermittent
   return to SR with Amiodarone started and QTc has decreased
   significantly.  During times of tachycardia she does have significant
   impairment of effective stroke volume and in the setting of some volume
   replacement has had improved stability of blood pressure.  She has had
   substantial improvement in neurologic exam across the first 24hours
   here.  This is in the setting of argatroban continued in the setting of
   small SAH given extensive arterial and venous clot burden and after
   discussion with Neurosurgery.
   0.5)Respiratory Failure
patient with minimal secretions, patient with
   improved mental status
opens eyes to voice but minimal follow of
   commands.  She does have favorable RSBI and tolerance of SBT with
   modest increase in HR but that is confounded by atrial trachycardia
   intermittent.  She has reasonable gag reflex and in the setting of
   minimal secretions is favorable for extubation.
   -If ABG favorable following SBT extubate
   -Will maintain PSV if SBT unfavorable
   -Will extubate post CT today
   1)CARDIAC ARREST/TACHYCARDIA-Likely related to R on T type phenomena in
   the setting of quinidine
   -Amiodarone to continue
   -EP to follow
   2)C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   -PO Vanco to continue
   3)SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)-
   -Mental status continues slow trend to improvement
   -Will repeat head CT today pre-extubation
   4)Venous Thombosis-
   -Argatroban
   -Careful dosing of levels but is required in the setting of such

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who was admitted with cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. She has shown significant improvement in hemodynamics, neurologic exam, and mental status over the first 24 hours. The patient has been treated for several medical complications including C. difficile infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and venous thrombosis. She continues to receive amiodarone for cardiac arrhythmia and argatroban for venous thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) CARDIAC ARREST/TACHYCARDIA: The patient experienced cardiac arrest likely related to R on T type phenomena in the setting of quinidine use. Amiodarone is being continued to manage the cardiac arrhythmia, and an electrocardiogram (EP) will follow up.
2) C. DIFFICILE INFECTION: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, and PO vancomycin will continue to be administered.
3) SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH): The patient has a slow trend towards improvement in mental status, and a repeat head CT will be done today before extubation.
4) VENOUS THROMBOsis: Argatroban is being used for anticoagulation, and careful dosing of levels is required due to the extensive clot burden. A consultation with the Hematology team will be sought to identify the source of significant thrombosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, with massive clot
   burder, likely secondary to HIT, presenting with cardiac arrest likely
   secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Intermittently HR 150's, otherwise in 80s. Her bp
   tolerated the SVT with SBPs in 110s. She is hypertensive when in sinus.
   patient has had this since [**2147**]. She was planned for ablation prior to
   urological procedure. She was re-admitted for clot burden before this
   could happen, so pt was started on quinidine and metoprolol. She came
   in with cardiac arrest secondary to torsades
   - Anticipate EP ablation today.
   - Amiodarone gtt for now at 0.5mg/min
   - will switch to Amiodarone 200mg TID PO when extubated
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   - Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for now.
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. This is presumably from HIT
   since platelets decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital.
   She has had 2 negative HIT antibodies, but history suggestive of HIT,
   and DIC/hemolyis is not consistent.
   - appreciate hematology consult, will send Serotonin release assay, and
   make PTT goal lower.
   - continue argatroban for now with PTT goal 40-60.
   - hold off on coumadin pending plan for ablation
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will obtain repeat head CT now
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case
   Respiratory Failure: Intubated in setting of cardiac arrest. The
   patient passed SBT this morning. Will extubate in the AM, after patient
   gets repeat head CT for SAH. Not on sedation.
   - extubate in AM
   Clostridium Difficile: No cultures, but patient presumed to have c diff
   because of elevated white count at OSH and c diff like stool
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - Start IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - send stool for c diff
   - PRN loperamide
   Nausea/Gagging: patient gagging. With some green emesis. [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   secondary intubation with no sedation
   - antiemetics PRN
   - propofol
   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute.
   - extubate after EP study
   Hypotension: Resolved. off pressors for >36 hours
   FEN: tube feeds. will hold tube feeds at midnight for probable
   extubation in the AM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), and a massive clot burden likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine and metoprolol.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Torsades de pointes: This is a type of ventricular tachycardia that can lead to cardiac arrest. It is associated with prolonged QT intervals and can be triggered by medications such as quinidine and metoprolol.

2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): This is an immune-mediated adverse reaction to heparin, resulting in low platelet counts and an increased risk of thrombosis. The patient has a history of HIT and has developed multiple thromboses including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts.

3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): The patient may have experienced a small subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely due to anticoagulation and trauma during cardiac arrest. Further evaluation is recommended with repeat head CT scans.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to cardiac"

   Assessment and Plan
   This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, with massive clot
   burder, likely secondary to HIT, presenting with cardiac arrest likely
   secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Intermittently HR 150's, otherwise in 80s. Her bp
   tolerated the SVT with SBPs in 110s. She is hypertensive when in sinus.
   patient has had this since [**2147**]. She was planned for ablation prior to
   urological procedure. She was re-admitted for clot burden before this
   could happen, so pt was started on quinidine and metoprolol. She came
   in with cardiac arrest secondary to torsades
   - Anticipate EP ablation today.
   - Amiodarone gtt for now at 0.5mg/min
   - will switch to Amiodarone 200mg TID PO when extubated
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   - Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for now.
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. This is presumably from HIT
   since platelets decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital.
   She has had 2 negative HIT antibodies, but history suggestive of HIT,
   and DIC/hemolyis is not consistent.
   - appreciate hematology consult, will send Serotonin release assay, and
   make PTT goal lower.
   - continue argatroban for now with PTT goal 40-60.
   - hold off on coumadin pending plan for ablation
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will obtain repeat head CT now
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case
   Respiratory Failure: Intubated in setting of cardiac arrest. The
   patient passed SBT this morning. Will extubate in the AM, after patient
   gets repeat head CT for SAH. Not on sedation.
   - extubate in AM
   Clostridium Difficile: No cultures, but patient presumed to have c diff
   because of elevated white count at OSH and c diff like stool
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - Start IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - send stool for c diff
   - PRN loperamide
   Nausea/Gagging: patient gagging. With some green emesis. [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   secondary intubation with no sedation
   - antiemetics PRN
   - propofol
   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute.
   - extubate after EP study
   Hypotension: Resolved. off pressors for >36 hours
   FEN: tube feeds. will hold tube feeds at midnight for probable
   extubation in the AM

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and supra ventricular tachycardia. She presented with a massive clot burden likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and subsequently developed cardiac arrest likely due to torsades de pointes from quinidine and metoprolol. She was intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. She also has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. She has had two negative HIT antibodies but has a history suggestive of HIT, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis is not consistent. The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage is small on CT scan and she has respiratory failure due to cardiac arrest. She also has Clostridium difficile infection, nausea/gagging, and hematuria likely secondary to anticoagulation. The patient's altered mental status has improved, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering the cardiac arrest. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient already has a pulmonary embolism, which is a potential complication of HIT and deep vein thrombosis.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of supra vent"

   Assessment and Plan
   This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, with massive clot
   burder, likely secondary to HIT, presenting with cardiac arrest likely
   secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Intermittently HR 150's, otherwise in 80s. Her bp
   tolerated the SVT with SBPs in 110s. She is hypertensive when in sinus.
   patient has had this since [**2147**]. She was planned for ablation prior to
   urological procedure. She was re-admitted for clot burden before this
   could happen, so pt was started on quinidine and metoprolol. She came
   in with cardiac arrest secondary to torsades
   - hold all QT prolonging medications
   - Amiodarone gtt for now at 0.5mg/min
   - will switch to Amiodarone 200mg TID PO when extubated
   - Patient needs ablation, will f/u with EP if this will be done here or
   as outpatient. Venous access with clot burden is limiting factor of
   ablation.
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS. Repeat ECHO shows worse MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 5296**]sed systolic dysfunction from ECHO done [**2156-1-27**]
   - repeat ECHO when extubated
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   - Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for now.
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. This is presumably from HIT
   since platelets decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital.
   She has had 2 negative HIT antibodies, but history suggestive of HIT,
   and DIC/hemolyis is not consistent.
   - appreciate hematology consult, will send Serotonin release assay, and
   make PTT goal lower.
   - continue argatroban for now with PTT goal 40-60.
   - hold off on coumadin pending plan for ablation
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will obtain repeat head CT now
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case
   Respiratory Failure: Intubated in setting of cardiac arrest. The
   patient passed SBT this morning. Will extubate in the AM, after patient
   gets repeat head CT for SAH. Not on sedation.
   - extubate in AM
   Clostridium Difficile: No cultures, but patient presumed to have c diff
   because of elevated white count at OSH and c diff like stool
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - Start IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - send stool for c diff
   - PRN loperamide
   Nausea/Gagging: patient gagging. With some green emesis. [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   secondary intubation with no sedation
   - antiemetics PRN
   - PRN versed boluses
   Hematurea: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute.
   - extubate
   Hypotension: RESOLVED. off pressors for >36 hours
   FEN: tube feeds. will hold tube feeds at midnight for probable
   extubation in the AM

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She presented with a massive clot burden, likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and experienced cardiac arrest likely due to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. SVT: The patient has intermittent episodes of SVT with a heart rate of 150 beats per minute. It is unclear whether it is atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). The patient's blood pressure is well-tolerated during SVT episodes. She has been started on amiodarone for rate control, and an ablation procedure is planned.

2. Massive clot burden: The patient has numerous thromboses, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. This is presumed to be due to HIT, as the patient's platelet count decreased by more than 50% during initial hospitalization. The patient is currently on argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, with a target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 40-60 seconds. A serotonin release assay will be sent to confirm the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, SVT, and massive clot burden likely secondary to HIT. She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient underwent an AVNRT ablation and is now in sinus rhythm. She experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. The patient has been extubated and is following commands, but has difficulty with speech. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk of bleeding complications.
2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although the coagulopathy is not due to HIT, there is a risk of thrombotic events due to anticoagulation therapy.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole.
4. Neurological impairment: The patient's altered mental status and difficulty with speech may indicate neurological impairment, possibly due to the SAH or anoxic brain injury.
5. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if she experiences further complications.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's"

   and will monitor.
   - appreciate hematology consult, f/u Serotonin release assay.
   - discontinue argatroban, had been switched to heparin, but will
   discontinue this and bridge to coumadin with lovenox
   - start with low coumadin dose 2mg given on flagyl and amiodarone
   - if neuro exam ad head CTs stable
   - malignancy w/u as outpatient
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - repeat head CT stable [**2-15**]
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case, will monitor neuro exams
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   -          Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for
   now.
   -          ECG to monitor Qt
   Respiratory Failure: now extubated
   Clostridium Difficile: Patient had positive c diff at OSH, negative
   here.
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**]); needs S/S eval
   - IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - hold loperamide given increased risk of toxic megacolon
   Nausea/Gagging: No further symptoms now extubated
   - antiemetics PRN
   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute. [**Last Name (un) **]
   extubated, she is following commads and moving all extremities, but
   seems to have difficulty with speech.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and massive clot burden likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT). The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol.

The patient underwent successful SVT ablation and is now in normal sinus rhythm. The arterial line stopped at 04:00 PM. The patient was extubated this morning.

The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. Hematology consulted and felt symptoms were not consistent with HIT, so they restarted heparin and will monitor. However, the decision was made to discontinue argatroban and bridge to coumadin with low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) due to the presence of thromboses.

The patient also has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated, and repeat head CT stable. Although anticoagulating the patient with SAH is not ideal, it is necessary in this case, and the neuro exam will be monitored.

   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. This is presumably from HIT
   since platelets decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital.
   She has had 2 negative HIT antibodies, but history suggestive of HIT,
   and DIC/hemolyis is not consistent. Hematology consulted and feel
   symptoms with 2 negative hit ab not c/w HIT sop have restarted heparin

   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute. [**Last Name (un) **]

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and massive clot burden, likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. She was successfully resuscitated and underwent successful ablation of the SVT.

The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. This is presumed to be due to HIT since her platelet count decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital. Although she had two negative HIT antibodies, her clinical history is suggestive of HIT, and the hematology team agrees that symptoms with two negative HIT abs are not consistent with HIT. Therefore, they have restarted heparin and will monitor.

The patient also has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. The SAH is small on CT scan. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated, and the patient will have repeat head CTs stable.

Other issues include respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile, nausea/gagging, hematuria, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest and was ext"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She presented with a massive clot burden, likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT), and experienced cardiac arrest likely due to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient underwent successful ablation of SVT and was extubated this morning. She has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. She also has a small subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on CT scan, which is likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on systemic anticoagulation with argatroban and has been restarted on heparin. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is now extubated. She has a history of Clostridium difficile infection at the outside hospital but is negative here. She is also experiencing nausea/gagging, hematuria likely secondary to anticoagulation, and altered mental status with difficulty speaking. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is following commands. She has been moved to the ICU for close monitoring.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note.

The patient's arterial line stopped at 04:00 PM and successful SVT ablation into NSR (normal sinus rhythm) was performed. The patient was given amiodarone through a gt tube. Heme does not think this is HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), so they switched to heparin from argatroban. A serotonin assay is still pending. The patient's ventilator settings were set on minimal settings for extubation in the morning. No neurosurgical recommendations were made, and the patient was successfully extubated in the morning.

The patient has allergies to erythromycin base and heparin agents, resulting in thrombocytopenia. The last doses of antibiotics given were metronidazole at 05:16 PM on 02/16 and vancomycin at 06:08 PM on 02/16.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of argatroban at 1 mcg/kg/min and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 AM on 02/17. Other medications include metoprolol at 01:00 AM on 02/17.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 02/17/2156 shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F) and current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F). The patient's heart rate is 58 bpm with a range of 58-141 bpm. Blood pressure readings are 97/55 mmHg with a range of 65-117/79-85 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute with a range of 14-22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

   A/P: This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, with massive
   clot burder, likely secondary to HIT, presenting with cardiac arrest
   likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Intermittently HR 150's, otherwise in 80s. Her bp
   tolerated the SVT with SBPs in 110s. She is hypertensive when in sinus.
   patient has had this since [**2147**]. She was planned for ablation prior to
   urological procedure. She was re-admitted for clot burden before this
   could happen, so pt was started on quinidine and metoprolol. She came
   in with cardiac arrest secondary to torsades
   - Anticipate EP ablation today.
   - Amiodarone gtt for now at 0.5mg/min
   - will switch to Amiodarone 200mg TID PO when extubated
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   - Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for now.
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. This is presumably from HIT
   since platelets decreased by >50% on initial admission from hospital.
   She has had 2 negative HIT antibodies, but history suggestive of HIT,
   and DIC/hemolyis is not consistent.
   - appreciate hematology consult, will send Serotonin release assay, and
   make PTT goal lower.
   - continue argatroban for now with PTT goal 40-60.
   - hold off on coumadin pending plan for ablation
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will obtain repeat head CT now
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case
   Respiratory Failure: Intubated in setting of cardiac arrest. The
   patient passed SBT this morning. Will extubate in the AM, after patient
   gets repeat head CT for SAH. Not on sedation.
   - extubate in AM
   Clostridium Difficile: No cultures, but patient presumed to have c diff
   because of elevated white count at OSH and c diff like stool
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - Start IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - send stool for c diff
   - PRN loperamide
   Nausea/Gagging: patient gagging. With some green emesis. [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   secondary intubation with no sedation
   - antiemetics PRN
   - propofol
   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute.
   - extubate after EP study
   Hypotension: Resolved. off pressors for >36 hours

   extubation in the AM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), and massive clot burden, likely secondary to HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. 

The patient has had SVT since 2147 and was planned for ablation prior to urological procedure. However, she was readmitted for clot burden before the ablation could take place. As a result, the patient was started on quinidine and metoprolol. She then experienced a cardiac arrest secondary to torsades. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Arterial line stopped on 02/16/16 at 04:00 PM.
2. Successful SVT ablation into NSR (normal sinus rhythm).
3. Heme does not think this is HIT, so switched to hep from argatroban, serotonin assay still pending.
4. Vent on minimal settings plan for extubate in AM.
5. No neurosurg recs.
6. Extubated this AM.
7. Allergies: Erythromycin base, rash; Heparin agents, thrombocytopenia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. 

The patient has undergone cardiac ablation for SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and has been in sinus rhythm since. She is currently on metoprolol 5mg IV q6hours, which will be changed to PO if she tolerates it and passes symptoms.

The patient also has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. Hematology consult has been requested, and the patient is being continued on lovenox bridge to coumadin.

The patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated, and the patient will have repeat head CT scans to monitor stability.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection previously at OSH but is negative here. She will continue with PO vanc for a two-week course and will have S/S evaluation. IV flagyl will be given in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea. Loperamide has been held due to"

   passes S/S
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. Hematology consulted and feel
   symptoms with 2 negative HIT ab not c/w HIT sop have restarted heparin
   and will monitor.
   - appreciate hematology consult, f/u Serotonin release assay.
   - discontinue argatroban, had been switched to heparin, but will
   discontinue this and bridge to coumadin with lovenox
   - start with low coumadin dose 2mg given on flagyl and amiodarone
   - if neuro exam ad head CTs stable
   - malignancy w/u as outpatient
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - repeat head CT stable [**2-15**]
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case, will monitor neuro exams
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   -          Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for
   now.
   -          ECG to monitor Qt
   Respiratory Failure: now extubated
   Clostridium Difficile: Patient had positive c diff at OSH, negative
   here.
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**]); needs S/S eval
   - IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - hold loperamide given increased risk of toxic megacolon
   Nausea/Gagging: No further symptoms now extubated

   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute. [**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia who presented with a massive clot burden likely secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She experienced cardiac arrest likely due to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient underwent ablation for SVT, which has been asymptomatic since. Torsades occurred after starting quinidine/metoprolol to treat SVT. 

Medical Complications:
1. Venous Thromboses: The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. Hematology consulted and restarted heparin, but will discontinue it and bridge to coumadin with lovenox. 
2. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: The patient likely has a subarachnoid hemorrhage from anticoagulation and trauma during cardiac arrest. The SAH is small on CT scan. Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated, and repeat head CT is stable.
3. Torsades de Pointes: The patient experienced torsades de pointes likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had a cardiac arrest likely secondary to this. ECG monitoring will be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, with massive
   clot burder, likely secondary to HIT, presenting with cardiac arrest
   likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Now s/p ablation, has been in sinus rhythem since.
   This has been diagnosed [**2147**], asymtomatic. Patient had torsades after
   being started on quinidine/metoprolol to treat this.
   - discontinue amiodarone gtt
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6hours, change to PO if tolerating,
   passes S/S
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts. Hematology consulted and feel
   symptoms with 2 negative HIT ab not c/w HIT sop have restarted heparin
   and will monitor.
   - appreciate hematology consult, f/u Serotonin release assay.
   - discontinue argatroban, had been switched to heparin, but will
   discontinue this and bridge to coumadin with lovenox
   - start with low coumadin dose 2mg given on flagyl and amiodarone
   - if neuro exam ad head CTs stable
   - malignancy w/u as outpatient
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - repeat head CT stable [**2-15**]
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case, will monitor neuro exams
   s/p Cardiac arrest: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [**Location (un) **]
   [**Location (un) 478**]. cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine.
   Patient intubated initially requiring phenylephrine, now off. CE
   negative at OSH, so not from ACS.
   Torsades: likely secondary to quinidine and metoprolol. The patient had
   cardiac arrest, likely secondary to this. OSH EKG with QTc in 670s. Her
   QT is now 440s.
   -          Will hold all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications for
   now.
   -          ECG to monitor Qt
   Respiratory Failure: now extubated
   Clostridium Difficile: Patient had positive c diff at OSH, negative
   here.
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**]); needs S/S eval
   - IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - hold loperamide given increased risk of toxic megacolon
   Nausea/Gagging: No further symptoms now extubated
   - antiemetics PRN
   Hematuria: likely secondary to anticoagulation. may have foley trauma
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematurea continues
   - consult urology in the AM if it continues
   Altered mental status: improved. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   because she was not following commands despite being off sedation. She
   had an EEG that showed encephalopathy at the OSH. she is following
   commands here, but anoxic brain injury is still possible considering
   cardiac arrest. Infection from c diff may also contribute. [**Last Name (un) **]
   extubated, she is following commads and moving all extremities, but
   seems to have difficulty with speech.
   -          consider neuro c/s
   -          serial CTs stable, continue to monitor
   -          consider ABG now extubated
   Hypotension: Resolved. off pressors for >48 hours

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient underwent ablation for SVT, which has been asymptomatic since. She developed torsades de pointes after starting on quinidine/metoprolol for SVT treatment. The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). She was previously on heparin, switched to argatroban due to suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and now restarted on heparin with plans to bridge to coumadin with lovenox. The patient also has an altered mental status, which improved after extubation. She has difficulty with speech and is at risk for anoxic brain injury and infection from Clostridium difficile (C. diff). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia): The patient's history of thromboses and negative HIT antibodies may suggest HIT as a possible cause. Monitoring platelet counts and considering alternative anticoagulation options are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), and multiple arterial and venous clots. She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient underwent cardiac arrest and had a QTc of 672 on arrival. She was resuscitated and placed on telemonitoring. The patient also has a history of SVT, which was ablated and has been in sinus rhythm since. She is currently on metoprolol 25mg PO BID for rate control. The patient's pump function is severely compromised with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 20%. She appears euvolemic and is autodiuresing. Oxygen weaning and cardiology follow-up have been recommended. The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. A hematology consult has been appreciated, and a serotonin release assay will be performed to rule out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Lovenox is being bridged to coumadin, and malignancy workup as an outpatient has been advised. The patient likely has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from anticoagulation and trauma"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5340**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team. Progress reviewed extensively during family
   meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Doing very well.  Voice is back.  No further SVT.  No
   clinically-apparent recurrent thrombosis on enoxaparin and warfarin,
   Plan:
   1. Video swallowing study
   2. Continue anticoagulation
   3. Rehab screening

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. She had a QTc of 672 on arrival to [Location]. She underwent cardiac ablation for SVT and has been in sinus rhythm since.

The patient was admitted with an echo showing severe global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) less than 20%. She appears euvolemic and autodiuresing. She is currently on metoprolol 25mg PO BID.

The patient also has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. There is unclear etiology for thrombophilia. A hematology consult has been appreciated, and a serotonin release assay will be followed up.

The patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. The SAH is small on CT scan. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated. The patient will be monitored for neuro exams.

The patient had a positive Clostridium difficile test at OSH but is negative here. She is continuing with PO vanc for a two-week course (day 1 [2-11]). IV flagyl will be given in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea. Loperamide will be held due to the increased risk of toxic megacolon.

The patient has failed speech and swallow but has shown improvement. She is able to make medications but will undergo a video swallow prior to starting diet. She is anticipated to improve with time. She is currently NPO.

The patient had hematuria, which has resolved. It was likely secondary to anticoagulation in the setting of Foley trauma. Her Hct will be monitored, and an ultrasound of the bladder and kidney will be done if hematuria returns.

The patient's FEN status is NPO pending symptom evaluation.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed, and her blood sugar levels are well-controlled. She has systemic anticoagulation with LMWH (lovenox) bridged to coumadin. She is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI and does not have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, with ongoing monitoring and management of various medical complications. The patient is planned to be transferred to the floor with a plan for rehabilitation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. She underwent resuscitation and was admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Torsades de Pointes: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to torsades de pointes, which is a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. The QTc interval on arrival was 672, indicating a prolonged QT interval. The patient is being monitored with an ECG to monitor the QT interval, and all QT prolonging and AV blocking medications have been held.

2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient had SVT, likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrioventricular nodal blocking (AT). She underwent ablation and has been in sinus rhythm since. She is currently receiving metoprolol 5mg IV q6hours and will be changed to PO if tolerating, passing symptoms.

3. Venous Thromboses: The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic"

- A video swallow will be done prior to starting the diet.
- The patient's hematuria has resolved, likely secondary to anticoagulation in the setting of Foley trauma.
- The patient's blood sugar has been well-controlled.
- She is currently NPO pending S/S eval.
- The patient's disposition is to transfer to the floor with a plan for rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. It is important to avoid QT prolonging medications and monitor the patient on tele.
2. SVT: The patient had a history of SVT, which has been ablated. However, there is a risk of recurrence, and metoprolol will be continued.
3. Pump failure: The patient has severe global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction <20%. Weaning oxygen and following up with cardiology outpatient are necessary.
4. Venous thromboses: The patient has numerous thromboses, including PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts, and unclear etiology for thrombophilia. Hematology consult is appreciated, and the patient will continue on lovenox bridge to coumadin.
5. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has a small subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated, and the patient's neuro exams will be monitored.
6. Clostridium difficile: The patient had a positive c-diff at OSH but is negative here. She will continue on a two-week course of PO vanc and receive IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea.
7. Speech and swallow dysfunction: The patient has failed speech and swallow but shows improvement in voice. A video swallow will be done prior to starting the diet.
8. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria has resolved, likely secondary to anticoagulation in the setting of Foley trauma."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival and experienced a cardiac arrest from torsades. She underwent ablation for SVT and has been in sinus rhythm since.

The patient also has severe global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) less than 20%. She appears euvolemic and autodiuresing. The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts. The etiology of thrombophilia is unclear.

The patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage likely from anticoagulation and trauma during cardiac arrest. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile at OSH but negative here. She will continue on a two-week course of PO vanc. Foley trauma resulted in hematuria, which has since resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, multiple arterial
   and venous clots presenting with cardiac arrest likely secondary to
   torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   s/p Cardiac arrest from Torsades: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival
   to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 478**]. Cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from
   quinidine.
   -Avoid QT prolonging medications for now.
   -monitor on tele
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Now s/p ablation, has been in sinus rhythm since.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   Pump: Patient admitted with echo showing severe global hypokinesis and
   EF <20%. Appear euvolemic.  Autodiuresing.
   -wean oxygen
   -cards follow up as outpatient
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts with unclear etiology for
   thrombophilia.
   - appreciate hematology consult, less likely HIT.  f/u Serotonin
   release assay.
   - Continue lovenox bridge to coumadin
   - malignancy w/u as outpatient
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - repeat head CT stable [**2-15**]
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case, will monitor neuro exams
   Clostridium Difficile: Patient had positive c diff at OSH, negative
   here.
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - hold loperamide given increased risk of toxic megacolon
   Fail speech and swallow. Voice improved.  Able to make meds but getting
   video swallow prior to starting diet. Anticipate improvement with time.
   -NPO for now
   Hematuria: Resolved.  Likely secondary to anticoagulation in setting of
   foley trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematuria returns

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. The patient presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from quinidine/metoprolol. She has been experiencing several medical complications since admission.

24-hour events include passing swallowing and speech tests for regular diet and thin liquids, getting out of bed to a chair, and being ready for discharge once a bed is available. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base and heparin agents, which can cause rash and thrombocytopenia.

Infusions include other ICU medications and heparin for systemic anticoagulation due to venous thromboses. The patient has a severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction less than 20% and appears euvolemic. There is a need for weaning oxygen and cardiac follow-up as an outpatient.

The patient has numerous thromboses with a massive clot burden, including pulmonary embolism, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, and splenic infarcts with unclear etiology for thrombophilia. A hematology consult is appreciated, and the patient will continue on lovenox bridge to coumadin. Malignancy workup is planned as an outpatient.

The patient also experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage likely from anticoagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This patient is a 78 y/o F with history of HTN, SVT, multiple arterial
   and venous clots presenting with cardiac arrest likely secondary to
   torsades from quinidine/metoprolol.
   s/p Cardiac arrest from Torsades: patient had a QTc of 672 on arrival
   to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 478**]. Cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades from
   quinidine.
   -Avoid QT prolonging medications for now.
   -monitor on tele
   SVT: AVNRT vs AT. Now s/p ablation, has been in sinus rhythm since.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   Pump: Patient admitted with echo showing severe global hypokinesis and
   EF <20%. Appear euvolemic.  Autodiuresing.
   -wean oxygen
   -cards follow up as outpatient
   Venous Thromboses: Patient has numerous thromboses with massive clot
   burden. She has PE, nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and
   upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts with unclear etiology for
   thrombophilia.
   - appreciate hematology consult, less likely HIT.  f/u Serotonin
   release assay.
   - Continue lovenox bridge to coumadin
   - malignancy w/u as outpatient
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: likely from anticoagulation and trauma of
   cardiac arrest. SAH is small on CT scan.
   - Neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - repeat head CT stable [**2-15**]
   - although anticoagulating patient with is SAH is not ideal, it is
   necessary in this case, will monitor neuro exams
   Clostridium Difficile: Patient had positive c diff at OSH, negative
   here.
   - continue PO vanc for 2 week course (day 1 [**2-11**])
   - IV flagyl in case of decreased absorption from diarrhea
   - hold loperamide given increased risk of toxic megacolon
   Fail speech and swallow. Voice improved.  Able to make meds but getting
   video swallow prior to starting diet. Anticipate improvement with time.
   -NPO for now
   Hematuria: Resolved.  Likely secondary to anticoagulation in setting of
   foley trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - will ultrasound bladder/kidney if hematuria returns
   FEN: NPO pending S/S eval

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and multiple arterial and venous clots. She presented with cardiac arrest likely secondary to torsades de pointes from quinidine/metoprolol. The patient has been in sinus rhythm since undergoing ablation for SVT. She also has severe global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 20%. She has a pulmonary embolism (PE), nonocclusive thrombosis of the descending aorta and upper abdominal aorta, splenic infarcts, and unclear etiology for thrombophilia. The patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) likely from anticoagulation and trauma of cardiac arrest. She tested positive for Clostridium difficile at another hospital but is negative here. The patient is unable to eat by mouth (NPO) due to failed speech and swallow, but her voice has improved. She is expected to improve with time. She also had hematuria that resolved, likely secondary to anticoagulation in the setting of Foley trauma. The patient requires further evaluation for potential bladder and kidney issues if hematuria returns. She is currently on systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridged to coumadin. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well controlled, and she is being monitored for any signs of ventil"
