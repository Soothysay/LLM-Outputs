   the AM if remains stable overnight.  If patient has significant
   bleeding then may need urgent endoscopy.  Patient currently on coumadin
   for atrial fibrillation.  INR 2.0 today, was given Vitamin K and FFP
   for reversal.  Currently receiving FFP.  Source of GI bleed unclear at
   this time.  Previous GI bleed from small bowel lymphoma.   Current
   bleed may also be from a lymphoma occuring in the GI tract.  Patient
   also has hx of EtOH which makes PUD/Gastritis also a possibility.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is acute anemia with a significant drop in hemoglobin levels from 40.4 on [**2195-12-12**] to 28.5 in the ED and currently at 22. The patient also presents with melena and has a history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is suspected to be the cause of the anemia. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight for a total of 6 units since admission. The source of the GI bleed is unclear, with possibilities including lymphoma or peptic ulcer disease/gastritis due to alcohol use. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with rate control and anticoagulation reversal due to the suspected GI bleed. The patient's INR was reversed in the ED with Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 22 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.0 x 10^9/L, normal platelet count of"

   done yesterday which showed gastritis, duodenitis and small ulcer in
   the greater curvature of the stomach. However, this is unlikely source
   as there was no stigmata of bleeding in the stomach and HCT did not
   bump appropriately overnight which suggests continued bleeding.  Plan
   is for colonoscopy [**Doctor First Name **] morning to eval for right sided colonic bleed.
   If negative then this suggests that bleeding is coming from the small
   intestine.  Bleeding scan will likely be unhelpful in the setting of
   this slow bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented with melena and an acute drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his current hemoglobin level is 29%. Upper endoscopy showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small ulcer in the greater curvature of the stomach, but no active bleeding was observed. The patient's hemoglobin levels did not increase appropriately overnight, suggesting continued bleeding. A plan for a colonoscopy in the morning has been made to evaluate for a right-sided colonic bleed. If the colonoscopy is negative, it would suggest that the bleeding is coming from the small intestine. A bleeding scan is unlikely to be helpful due to the slow rate of bleeding.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. His INR was reversed in the emergency department, and he is currently rate-controlled. The patient's medications have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient has new ECG changes likely due to strain from acute anemia. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath, and his cardiac enzymes have been negative on three occasions. An outpatient MIBI has been recommended by a cardiologist.

The patient's blood pressure should be monitored closely, and his current medications for hypertension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma currently in remission and on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. The patient presents with melena, likely indicating an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed gastritis and an old ulcer but not enough to explain the melena.

The patient has experienced four episodes of formed melena mixed with brown stool. He is being transfused but his hemoglobin levels are not increasing appropriately. A capsule endoscopy was performed, and he is preparing for a colonoscopy tomorrow to investigate the possibility of a right-sided colon bleed or tumor erosion.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/46 to 148/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation. The physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, jugular venous pressure (JVP) at 6 cm, clear lung sounds, and irregular heartbeat with an S1 and S2 heart sound. The abdominal examination shows no organomegaly but does reveal positive bowel sounds. The skin is described as warm and well perfused, with intact neurologic function.

Laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 111 K/uL, platelet count of 131 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 184 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The prothrombin time (PT) is 15.1 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 31.4 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.3. Troponin-T levels are below 0.01, calcium level is 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium level is 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate level is 2.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding). The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition, with checks on complete blood count (CBC) and INR every six hours and replacement as needed. Fluids are given as needed for urine output, and the patient has two large-bore intravenous (IV) lines. He is receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy twice daily. Medications for hypertension and atrial fibrillation are being adjusted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding from the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract, infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, kidney injury due to hypotension and fluid management, and thromboembolic events due to immobilization and the presence of atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented with melena and anemia, which led to the diagnosis of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient received a blood transfusion and his hematocrit levels are now stable. An upper endoscopy was performed, revealing gastritis, duodenitis, and a small ulcer in the greater curvature of the stomach. However, this is unlikely to be the source of the bleeding as the patient's hematocrit continued to fall after the colonoscopy without any signs of bleeding during the procedure. He is scheduled for a colonoscopy to evaluate for right colonic bleeding. If negative, it suggests that the bleeding is coming from the small intestine, and a capsule endoscopy will be needed for evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from the source of the initial upper GI bleed, especially if not identified or treated properly.
2. Infection: Due to the invasive procedures performed, there is a potential risk of developing infections such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and the acute drop in hematocrit may cause strain on the heart, leading to further cardiac complications.
4. Kidney injury"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented with melena (black, tarry stools) and acute anemia. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemoglobin concentration is now stable between 31-34% for 24 hours. This suggests that he likely had a slow upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed which has resolved. An upper endoscopy showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small ulcer in the greater curvature of the stomach, but this is unlikely to be the source of bleeding as his hemoglobin continued to fall during and after the colonoscopy without any signs of bleeding. The patient is scheduled for a colonoscopy this morning to evaluate for right colonic bleeding. If the colonoscopy is negative, it suggests that the bleeding is coming from the small intestine, and he will need a capsule endoscopy for evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a possibility of re-bleeding from the previously identified or new sources in the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Infection: Due to the use of invasive procedures like endoscopy and colonoscopy, there is a risk of developing infections, especially in the gastrointestinal tract.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 yom with hx of HTN, Hypertriglyceridemia,
   Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin who
   presents from home with melena and anemia.
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with Melena, and an acute HCT
   drop from 40
 22.  He has now received 6uPRBC and HCT 29 which is not
   appropriate.  He likely has a slow upper GI bleed.  Upper Endoscopy
   done yesterday which showed gastritis, duodenitis and small ulcer in
   the greater curvature of the stomach. However, this is unlikely source
   as there was no stigmata of bleeding in the stomach and HCT did not
   bump appropriately overnight which suggests continued bleeding.  Plan
   is for colonoscopy [**Doctor First Name **] morning to eval for right sided colonic bleed.
   If negative then this suggests that bleeding is coming from the small
   intestine.  Bleeding scan will likely be unhelpful in the setting of
   this slow bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented with melena (black, tarry stools) and anemia. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 29. He likely has a slow upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Upper endoscopy showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small ulcer in the greater curvature of the stomach, but this is unlikely to be the source of bleeding as there were no stigmata of bleeding in the stomach and the HCT did not increase appropriately overnight. A plan for colonoscopy has been made to evaluate for a right-sided colonic bleed. If the colonoscopy is negative, it suggests that the bleeding is coming from the small intestine. A bleeding scan is unlikely to be helpful due to the slow bleeding. 

Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient is experiencing a slow upper GI bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia. Further evaluation and management are required to identify the source of bleeding and control it.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. His INR was reversed in the emergency department, and he is currently rate-controlled"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma currently in remission and on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. The patient presented with melena, likely an upper gastrointestinal bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastritis and an old ulcer but not enough to explain the melena. The patient is being prepared for a colonoscopy today and will undergo capsule endoscopy as an outpatient. His hematocrit (Hct) level is stable, and the melena has resolved. The patient is receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastrointestinal protection. His blood pressure and heart rate are stable, but he has atrial fibrillation. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and further recommendations will be made after the colonoscopy. The patient's medication for hypertension is temporarily held, and he will restart a beta-blocker today. His anticoagulation medication (Coumadin) and aspirin have been held, and he will be bridged with low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) after the procedure. The ECG changes do not indicate myocardial infarction, and an outpatient stress test along with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended. The patient's lymphoma is in remission."
