   Assessment and Plan:
   40 YO F with history of HTN, EtOH pancreatitis s/p CCY, alcoholic
   hepatitis, admitted for weakness and presumed peripheral neuropathy
   secondary to malnutrition who now has unresponsiveness and concern for
   nonconvulsive status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Seizures vs. toxic/metabolic. Nonconvulsive
   status most likely given observed rhythmic mov'ts that per neuro
   correspond to EEG pattern and cease after ativan and keppra.
   Metabolic/infectious possibilities: UTI/urosepsis, hepatic
   encephalopathy (elevated ammonia, though no concern for this per liver
   team), drug effect/withdrawal (outside window for DTs, not enough
   standing benzos to explain withdrawal seizures). Other infectious
   possibilities include C.dif given large volume of diarrhea.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - keppra 2000IV then 1000mg IV bid
   - blood, urine cx
   - Cidif
   - Cont. vanco/amoxicillin for UTI
   - lactulose for ?hepatic encephalopathy
   - correct hyponatremia with free water
   .
   # Weakness: Likely multifactorial etiology including chronic anemia,
   malnutrition and possibly alcohol consumption.
   - IVF o/n
   - Encourage po intake once awake/alert
   - Nutrition consult, calorie count as appropriate
   - Replete vitamin deficiencies as below.
   .
   # Hepatitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Appears to be resolving alcoholic
   hepatitis with baseline NASH. [**Doctor First Name **], AMA, [**Last Name (un) 3056**] negative. Hepatitis A and
   C serologies negative, Hep B surface antigen positive. Also with a
   history of a gastric bypass operation with severe nutritional
   deficiency that corroborates a diagnosis of NASH.
   - Continue Lactulose, but monitor fluid status closely
   - Ursodial [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Nutritional Deficiency: On last admission noted to have atrophic
   macroglossia, angular cheilitis, a macrocytic anemia and a vitamin K
   responsive elevated INR.
   - Supplement Thiamine, Folate, Zinc, B-12 and a Multivitamin
   - Recheck INR
   .
   # Alcoholism: On last admission, Nutrition, SW and primary team
   provided counseling on this issue, but patient deferred formal
   assistance post-discharge.
   - SW Addictions when appropriate
   - Monitor of withdrawal
   .
   # s/p Roux-en-Y: With history of malnutrition.
   - Supplement diet as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of hypertension, EtOH pancreatitis post cholecystectomy, alcoholic hepatitis, admitted for weakness and presumed peripheral neuropathy secondary to malnutrition. She is currently unresponsive and there is concern for nonconvulsive status.

24-hour events include being loaded with keppra, elevated sodium levels, low urine output, seizures, and initiation of various antibiotics. She received 2 liters of half-normal saline at 150 ccs/hr due to hypernatremia and low urine output. The patient started experiencing epileptiform activity seen on EEG, which was partially resolved with 4 mg of Ativan.

Allergies include codeine, hives from sulfa antibiotics, and abdominal pain from morphine. The last doses of antibiotics (Acyclovir and ceftriaxone) were given at 04:56 AM on [**2132-11-11**]. Lorazepam (Ativan) was administered at 02:56 AM on the same day.

Flow sheet data as of [**2132-11-11**] 07:56 AM shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo female with history of cirrhosis now with progressive and
   significant weakness which has been refractory to nutritional
   supplementation and had re-presentation with UTI but then found
   unresponsive on [**11-10**].  Hospital course notable for epileptiform
   activity on EEG and treatment with benzodiazepines did contribute to
   resolution.  She, in the SICU has had Keppra loading and EEG monitoring
   with suggestion of resolution of seizure activity with Keppra + Ativan.
   Now--patient has persistent alteration in mental status and with
   unresponsiveness felt to be in part related to hepatic encephalopathy,
   UTI, residual effects of medications, and patient with respiratory
   alkalosis noted and patient now paralyzed across the night.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will D/C paralytics
   -Will move to PSV
   -Barrier to extubation is mental status
   -If unable to effectively maintain mental status, will have to consider
   trach and chronic vent support but do have hope for mental status to
   return.
   -Will move to wean fentanyl and propofol to off today
   -Patient does have reassuring head CT in the setting of respiratory
   alkalosis
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   -Keppra
   -EEG D/C
   -Will call neurology prior to intervention with benzodiazepines
   3)Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy-Nutritional deficiency being
   treated and ongoing treatment for seizures as well
this may well be
   multifactorial at this time.  We will continue to work with leading
   possibility of protein load in the setting of refeeding driving
   encephalopathy.
   -Niacin
   -Lactulose
   -MVI/Folate/B12/IRon/Zinc/B6
   -L-Carnitine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis. She presented with progressive weakness that was refractory to nutritional supplementation. She was found unresponsive on 11/10 and had epileptiform activity on EEG. Treatment with benzodiazepines contributed to the resolution of seizure activity. In the SICU, the patient received loading doses of Keppra and Ativan, and EEG monitoring showed a suggestion of resolution of seizure activity.

The patient now has persistent alteration in mental status and unresponsiveness, which is believed to be related to hepatic encephalopathy, UTI, residual effects of medications, and respiratory alkalosis. The patient is currently paralyzed across the night.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - Will D/C paralytics, move to PSV, barrier to extubation is mental status. If unable to effectively maintain mental status, consider trach and chronic vent support.
2. Seizure Disorder - Keppra, EEG D/C, call neurology prior to intervention with benzodiazepines.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy - Nutritional deficiency being treated and ongoing treatment for seizures as well. Multifactorial at this time, will continue to work with leading possibility of protein load in the setting of refeeding driving encephalopathy.
   - Niacin, Lactulose, MVI/Folate/B12/IRon/Zinc/B6, L-Carnitine. Hold benzo for now to allow better understanding of acute events.
4. Cirrhosis - Lactulose, supervised feedings with tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's current respiratory failure may progress if not managed appropriately. Extubation may be challenging due to mental status alterations.
2. Seizure Disorder - There is a risk of recurrent seizures if the underlying cause is not addressed properly.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy - The patient's mental status may further deteriorate if hepatic encephalopathy is not managed effectively. Nutritional deficiencies and refeeding syndrome are also potential concerns.
4. Cirrhosis - The patient's cirrhosis may worsen if proper management of hepatic encephalopathy and nutrition is not implemented.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management of the identified complications to ensure optimal outcomes."

   .
   # Seizures/altered mental status.  Unclear etiology, although most
   likely cause currently is hepatic encephalopathy possibly worsened by
   combination of UTI as well as protein load with initiation of tube
   feeds.  No organic cause on head mri/ct and no history of seizure.
   Persistent encephalopathy at this point also likely in part due to
   ativan that she was given for seizure like activity in a patient with
   hepatic dysfunction.  She has not had any seizures since [**11-10**] and has
   been continued on keppra.  Neurology service also started vitamin
   replacement given that in severe deficiencies can contribute to
   encephalopathy.    Paralysis has been discontiued, although she
   continues to be sedated to reduce respiratory alkylosis.

   # Seizures/altered mental status - Unclear etiology, although currently
   hepatic encephalopathy is at the top of the differential, possibly
   worsened by  UTI,  as well as glucose and protein load with initiation
   of tube feeds.  No organic cause on head mri/ct and no history of
   seizure.  She has received numerous doses of ativan during her seizure
   activity, and given her liver failure, it may still not be cleared.
   Toxin from glue from hair piece is also a rare possibility.  She has
   not had any seizures since [**11-10**] and has been continued on keppra.
   Neurology service also started vitamin replacement given that in severe
   deficiencies can contribute to encephalopathy.   Paralysis has been
   discontiued, although she continues to be sedated to reduce respiratory
   alkylosis.

 Na = 151 today.  Started on tube feeding, start free
   water boluses and follow PM lytes.
   #Respiratory alkalosis: appears to be of central origin, not
   compensatory.  Most likely cause is hepatic encephalopathy, central
   process, related to malignancy or side effect of chemotherapy.   Also
   on differential is PE, however it does not explain her mental status,

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hepatic failure, hypothermia, hypotension, altered mental status, and seizure disorder. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory alkalosis. She has a history of allergies to codeine, sulfa, and morphine. She is on multiple medications including fentanyl, famotidine, and acyclovir. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Her laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 160 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires close monitoring and management of her mechanical ventilation settings to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy may develop or"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8573**], a 40-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, recent alcoholic hepatitis/pancreatitis, and severe malnutrition/vitamin deficiency, was admitted to the ICU with complaints of progressive weakness, falls, seizures, and unresponsiveness. She has a history of Roux en Y gastric bypass surgery in [**2126**]. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypothermia
2. Hypotension (not in shock)
3. Alkalosis, respiratory
4. Altered mental status (not delirium)
5. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
6. Seizure, without status epilepticus

Medical Complications:

   # Seizures/altered mental status - Unclear etiology, although currently
   hepatic encephalopathy is at the top of the differential, possibly
   worsened by  UTI,  as well as glucose and protein load with initiation
   of tube feeds.  No organic cause on head mri/ct and no history of
   seizure.  She has received numerous doses of ativan during her seizure
   activity, and given her liver failure, it may still not be cleared.
   She has not had any seizures since [**11-10**] and has been continued on
   keppra.  Neurology service also started vitamin replacement given that
   in severe deficiencies can contribute to encephalopathy.   Paralysis
   has been discontinued, had been sedated in attempt to reduce
   respiratory alkalosis.  Now off sedation.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8573**] is a 40-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, recent alcoholic hepatitis/pancreatitis, and severe malnutrition/vitamin deficiency. She was admitted to the ICU for progressive weakness and falls, as well as seizures and unresponsiveness. The patient's medical history includes gastric bypass surgery and chronic anemia. She has been readmitted to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] with complaints of progressive weakness and falls at home, along with the development of seizures and unresponsiveness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering her history of cirrhosis and recent alcoholic hepatitis. This condition can be worsened by a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a high protein and glucose load during the initiation of tube feeds.

2. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's minute ventilation decreased significantly overnight, leading to respiratory acidosis. This may be caused by hepatic encephalopathy or a central nervous system process.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 149, indicating hypernatremia. Free water boluses have been given, and free water administration will continue to follow electrolyte levels.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. This could be"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who presented with progressive weakness and malnutrition. She is now obtunded and encephalopathic, with unexplained severe respiratory alkalosis. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, altered mental status/encephalopathy, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, and possible brain death.

Respiratory Failure: The patient's metabolic alkalosis has reversed, indicating a change in respiratory drive. The RSBI (Respiratory System Impairment Score) is 98, indicating a high risk for extubation failure due to inadequate respiratory effort.

Seizure Disorder: The patient had a seizure, which is being managed with Keppra (levetiracetam).

Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits rapid increase in urine output, non-reactive pupils, and altered mental status. A non-contrast head CT has been ordered to evaluate for possible neurologic injury. Nutritional supplementation is being continued.

Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated serum sodium levels. Fluid boluses with 3% hypertonic saline are being administered.

Possible Brain Death: The patient's head CT shows evidence of devastating neurologic injury, including global cerebral ischemia and hypodense appearance of the occipital lobes. There is also evidence of uncal herniation and probable downward transtentorial herniation. Neurosurgery and neurology have been consulted, and"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and malnutrition. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has reversed to respiratory acidosis, and she has increased urine output. She is unable to provide her own medical history as she is sedated.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the main concern at the moment. Her metabolic alkalosis has reversed, which may indicate a new neurologic injury. The RSBI (respiratory system assessment) score is 98, indicating the need for close monitoring and potential intervention.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, and it is mentioned that she had a seizure without status epilepticus. Continuous treatment with Keppra is being continued.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has changed rapidly, with non-reactive pupils and a change in respiratory drive. A non-contrast head CT has been ordered to further evaluate her neurologic status.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and fluid boluses of FH20 have been given.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, malnutrition, obtubation/encephalopathy, and unexplained severe respiratory alkalosis. The patient's condition includes hypotension, altered mental status, seizure disorder, and hypernatremia. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she is not responsive to noxious stimuli. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, low creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by her inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can lead to further deterioration in her condition if not properly managed.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, which could be exacerbated by her current encephalopathy and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to monitor for seizure activity and continue seizure prophylaxis.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, as it may indicate a worsening neurologic condition. A non-contrast head CT should be obtained to assess for any new neurologic injuries.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected gradually to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. Fluid restriction and careful monitoring of serum"

   progressive weakness and falls at home who developed seizures and
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   1) Diffuse cerebral edema - Unclear what caused it but seems to be
   associated with acute drop in minute ventilation with pH becoming
   acidotic.  Unclear whether this was the precipitant or associated with
   the event that led to the edema.  Given her hx of hepatic
   encepalopathy, its possible that she developed increased ICP secondary
   to encephalopathy leading to her edema with the resulting mass shift
   seen on imaging.  No evidence for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6003**] reflex.  Also possible
   that decreased minute ventilation due to unknown cause precipitated an
   acidotic state that precipitated the edema.    Regardless of etiology,
   prognosis is poor, with loss of pupillary response, respiratory
   failure, and significantly increasing UOP probably secondary to a
   central diabetes insipidus.

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, who underwent Roux en Y gastric bypass in [**2126**], recent alcoholic hepatitis/pancreatitis, and previous admission from [**9-1**] to [**9-8**] for severe malnutrition/vitamin deficiency thought [**3-10**] peripheral neuropathy. She presented with progressive weakness and falls at home, developed seizures, and unresponsiveness. 

Her current condition includes diffuse cerebral edema, hypotension, increased urine output with high sodium levels, and hypoxic etiology. The prognosis is poor, with near brain death and significantly increasing urine output likely secondary to central diabetes insipidus. The family has been informed of the plan and wishes to continue aggressive care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cerebral edema leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation, sepsis due to compromised immune system, further electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. 

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical assessments and investigations may be necessary to determine the exact medical complications and their management."

   associated with acute drop in minute ventilation with pH becoming

   the event that led to the edema.  Given her hx of hepatic
   encepalopathy, its possible that she developed increased ICP secondary
   to encephalopathy leading to her edema with the resulting mass shift
   seen on imaging.  No evidence for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6003**] reflex.  Also possible
   that decreased minute ventilation due to unknown cause precipitated an
   acidotic state that precipitated the edema.    Regardless of etiology,
   prognosis is poor, with loss of pupillary response, respiratory

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in [**2126**]. She has recently experienced alcoholic hepatitis/pancreatitis and was admitted to the hospital for severe malnutrition/vitamin deficiency. The patient presented with progressive weakness and falls at home, which then progressed to seizures and unresponsiveness.

24-hour events:
- The patient's CT scan showed diffuse cerebral edema, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, possibly due to hypoxic etiology.
- There was a significant increase in urine output and sodium levels, which were resolved after giving half-normal saline with free water through the NG tube.
- The patient was hypotensive and started on pressors. Normal saline boluses were also given.
- Neurology will evaluate the patient for brain death in the morning.

Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse cerebral edema: The cause of the edema is unclear, but it may be associated with an acute drop in minute ventilation and acidosis. Given the patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy, it is possible that she developed increased intracranial pressure secondary to encephalopathy, leading to the edema and resulting mass shift seen on imaging. There is no evidence of the [**Initials (NamePattern4)**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6003]** reflex. It is also possible that"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with severe neurologic injury, respiratory failure, liver failure, and shock. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any history. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, and pressors. The patient's vital signs are within acceptable ranges, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/81 mmHg to 105/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is severely altered, with no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no assessed movement or tone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: Given the patient's severe neurologic injury and altered mental status, there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or development of additional complications such as seizures.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, atelectasis, or barotrauma.
3. Liver Failure Complications: The patient's liver failure can result in coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and impaired metabolism of medications.
4. Shock Complications: The patient's hypotension indicates ongoing shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential ischemia or infarction.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo female with history of cirrhosis now with progressive weakness,
   malnutrition, obtubation/encephalopathy, now s/p devastating neurologic
   injury, brain edema/herniation.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 985**], attending neurologist, completed the 24 hour brain death
   testing and confirmed that Mrs. [**Known lastname 8573**] has an exam consistent with
   brain death.  He and I were then both present for apnea testing.
   Baseline pCO2 was 40 and rose to 67 after 10 minutes of apnea performed
   according to the [**Hospital1 1**] brain death testing protocol/guidelines.  Time
   of death was established as 12:51PM.  The brain death checklist was
   completed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 985**] and placed it in the medical record.  Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 985**] and I then informed the family about the findings and that she
   was now legally deceased.  They had appropriate questions but were
   accepting.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8573**]
s two sons had a brief altercation during our
   meeting that they resolved without need for intervention by [**Hospital1 1**]
   Public Safety.  The family is now present at the bedside as mechanical
   ventilation is withdrawn.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8573**]
s father, who is the primary
   decision maker, has requested an autopsy.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8573**]
s husband and
   the remainder of the family are also in agreement.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8573**]
s father would also like to further discuss at some point
   in the near future his daughter
s clinical course.  I will have Patient
   Relations contact him to help navigate this discussion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis. She has been experiencing progressive weakness, malnutrition, obtubation/encephalopathy, and has now suffered a devastating neurologic injury with brain edema/herniation. The attending neurologist confirmed brain death after completing the 24-hour brain death testing. Apnea testing was performed according to the hospital's brain death testing protocol/guidelines, and the time of death was established at 12:51 PM. The family was informed about the findings and accepted the legal death of the patient. Mechanical ventilation is being withdrawn at the patient's bedside. The patient's father has requested an autopsy, and Patient Relations will help facilitate further discussion regarding the clinical course. The patient remains critically ill in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state, further deterioration of liver function leading to hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy, respiratory complications from mechanical ventilation withdrawal, and potential cardiovascular instability due to the use of vasopressors and the patient's underlying cirrhosis."
