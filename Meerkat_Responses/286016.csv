","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), fever, and apnea. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been febrile but is now afebrile since starting antibiotics. The source of infection is unclear, but there is a history of intraabdominal infections. A CT scan of the abdomen has been ordered today with oral contrast. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, Flagyl, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to liver disease and decompensation. Meningitis has been ruled out based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. Lactulose has been started to manage encephalopathy, and sedation will be weaned today.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels, which improved with fluids given in the emergency room. Fluids will be monitored, and medications will be dosed accordingly. IV contrast will be avoided if possible.

The patient has a history of liver transplant with recurrent liver failure, including recurrent hepatitis C infection. Tacrolimus levels will be checked, and lactulose will be continued to improve encephalopathy. The transplant team is following up, and hepatology consultation has been requested.

Other issues include anemia, chronic pain, diabetes,"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, fever, and apnea. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient is sedated and on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications. Firstly, he has encephalopathy likely due to liver disease and possible underlying infection. The source of infection is unclear, and a CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast has been ordered to investigate further. Secondly, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level from baseline. Fluid resuscitation in the emergency room helped improve his kidney function, and renal dosing of medications will be monitored. Thirdly, the patient has chronic hep C infection following his liver transplant. Tacrolimus levels will be checked, and lactulose will be given to improve encephalopathy. Lastly, the patient has anemia likely secondary to liver disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening encephalopathy, development of new infections, progression of AKI, complications related to his chronic hep C infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure following a liver transplant. He is currently sedated and unable to provide his own medical history. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Flagyl, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. There is a concern for possible pneumonia due to aspiration or a right upper quadrant (RUQ) collection. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is planned to further evaluate the RUQ collection and determine if it is a septic source that needs to be aspirated.

The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to encephalopathy from lactulose and/or a possible drug overdose. Benzodiazepines are being avoided. The patient's respiratory status remains depressed, and extubation will only be considered if there is improvement in mental status and the ability to follow simple commands.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis, and Coumadin has been held pending possible drainage of the RUQ collection.

Medical Complications:
1. Possible pneumonia due to aspiration or RUQ collection.
2. Altered mental status, likely encephalopathy from lactulose and/or drug overdose.
3. Depressed respiratory status.
4. Portal vein thrombosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 135/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema and muscle wasting. Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.0 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests. The patient is also found to have a right upper quadrant collection, which may be a portal vein thrombosis. The patient is being held on coumadin pending further evaluation and possible drainage. The plan is to follow up with repeat CT abdomen with contrast prehydrate and re-evaluate the mental status after the abdominal CT. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and potential sedation for travel. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and intubation increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia. The current treatment with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, fever, and apnea. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. A CT scan revealed a 6.7 x 3.8 cm fluid collection in the left upper quadrant, which is concerning for an abscess. There are also findings of right lower lobe pneumonia, slight interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, and extensive portal/mesenteric/splenic venous clot. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine level. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, chronic pain, diabetes, hypertension, bradycardia, coagulopathy, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's AMS may worsen if there is a recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy or if the underlying infection is not adequately controlled.
3. Fluid Collection/Abscess: The presence of a fluid collection in the left upper quadrant raises concern for an abscess. If not treated, it can lead to further infection and se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch tall individual who is currently sedated and unable to provide their own medical history. The patient's chief complaints are fever and encephalopathy. They have been admitted to the ICU and have been receiving various medications and treatments, including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/72 to 153/81 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 2,346 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,249 mL being given intravenously. The patient has also had a central line placed due to lost IV access.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 815 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 18. The patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), fever, and apnea. The patient was intubated and now extubated at 2pm without any immediate complications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/82 to 157/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, no endotracheal or NG tube in place, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, and no lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient also has abnormal renal function with an elevated creatinine level.

Microbiology results indicate the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and gram-negative rods in the abdominal fluid collection, suggesting a possible infection. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for an unknown source of infection, and a drain has been placed to address the fluid collection.

The patient has multiple medical issues including hepatic encephalopathy, pneumonia (aspiration), altered mental status (not delirium), recurrent"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of liver transplant and recurrent cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, fever, and apnea. The patient underwent extubation and is currently doing well.

The patient has several medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: The patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. Lactulose has been prescribed to manage this condition.

2. PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing reflex. Monitoring of ABGs (arterial blood gases) and respiratory support may be necessary.

3. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): The patient's altered mental status is likely due to liver disease decompensation. It is not likely to be meningitis based on CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) results.

4. ARF (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE): The patient's creatinine levels were elevated but have improved with fluid administration. Close monitoring of renal function is needed.

5. HEPATITIS C INFECTION: The patient has recurrent hepatitis C infection post-liver transplant. Treatment options should be considered.

6. ANEMIA: The patient's anemia is likely related to liver disease. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is important.

7. CHRONIC PAIN: The patient is on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), recurrent cirrhosis, and current admission with fever, associated with opioid overdose, encephalopathy, and liver abscess. The patient was intubated for apnea/encephalopathy but was extubated yesterday. He continues to be encephalopathic and requires a sitter. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. He has received antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a range of 51-87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/53 mmHg to 158/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 9-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,613 mL of total fluid, including 619 mL through the PO and 1,158 mL through the IVF. The output includes 1,720 mL of urine, 1,550 mL of NG, and 1,931 mL of drain balance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HCV and post-liver transplant, presenting with encephalopathy. The patient had an episode of apnea which resolved after the drainage of liver abscesses and improvement in mental status. The patient is currently on multiple medications including cefepime, flagyl, haloperidol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lactulose, rifaximin, oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, and kayexelate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate between 60-85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96-165 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets, along with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced with hypernatremia and mild hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infections: The patient has been diagnosed with liver abscesses and is currently on antibiotics (cefepime and flagyl). There is a potential risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing episodes of altered mental status and confusion, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HCV and post-transplant cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, encephalopathy, and liver abscesses. The patient is currently receiving lactulose for encephalopathy, cefepime and flagyl for liver abscesses, haloperidol for delirium, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis. He is also on other medications such as rifaximin and lactulose. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown improvement in his mental status and WBC count after drainage of the liver abscess. He has mild hypernatremia and hyperkalemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis and can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Liver abscess: The presence of liver abscesses can lead to systemic infection and sepsis if not properly treated.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may persist or recur due to ongoing infections, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient may be at risk for hypoglycemia due to liver dysfunction and medication use.
5. Hepatitis C recurrence: There is a possibility of hepatitis C recurrence post-transplant"
