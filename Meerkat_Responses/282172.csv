   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are not mentioned in the given information. However, it is stated that the patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25% with hypokinetic right ventricle and elevated right ventricular pressures. This indicates a compromised cardiac function, specifically heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 103 bpm, which is elevated. The blood pressure (BP) is 98/49 mmHg, indicating hypotension. The respiratory rate (RR) is 0 inspirations per minute, suggesting an inability to breathe spontaneously. The oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%, indicating adequate oxygenation.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg, which is high, indicating fluid overload or right ventricular dysfunction. The fluid balance reveals a net intake of 1,098 mL and output of 135 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 963 mL. This suggests inadequate urine output and potential fluid retention.

The respiratory support indicates the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV), with set tidal volumes (Vt) of 450 mL and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 23. The partial pressure of oxygen ("

   Disposition: pending above
","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with hypotension. She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction of 50-60%, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post aortofemoral bypass, and hypertension (HTN).

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic causes, or infectious etiology. It is unclear whether the hypotension is related to blood loss during the fall or displacement of the hemodialysis catheter leading to cardiac damage.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to prolonged hypotension, altered mental status, and concerns about airway protection. There is evidence of right heart strain, which raises the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE).

3. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (HCT) is around 30%, and it is stable currently. Monitoring and transfusion with a goal HCT of >28% or CVP <10-8 are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with h/o ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension.
   .
   # hypotension - consistent with hypovolemic shock given clinical
   history, HCT changes may not reflect acuity of bleed.  remains
   hypotensive despite 3U PRBC in ED and 1L IVF, in setting of unclear
   volume loss.  given h/o CHF current CVP is more consistent cardiogenic
   shock, also cool extremities, though this could also represent
   peripheral vasoconstriction.  while less likely given lack of fever,
   leukocytosis, sepsis is also a consideration.
   - transduce CVP from cordis -> 19, c/w cardiogenic shock.
   - check SvO2 to confirm decreased CO, if present, consider swan, for
   pressor guided diuresis.
   - check TTE to evaluate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**], valves.
   - start amio gtt for tachycardia.
   - transfuse PRBC and IVF NS if CVP<10.
   - titrate levophed gtt for MAP>65, could consider neo gtt given
   tachycardia, however must consider severe PVD, and risk of limb
   necrosis.
   - cover with vancomycin for now given L LE wounds.
   - check BCx, UCx.
   .
   # respiratory failure - pt intubated in the setting of prolonged
   hypotension, resulting on altered mental status, and concern over
   patient's airway.  pre-intubation ABG 7.35/46/340, consistent with good
   lung mechanics.
   - wean sedation as tolerated.
   - wean vent support.
   .
   # ?s/p fall - by report, fell out of bed causing HD line to be
   displaced.
   - c-collar.
   - plain films of hips, ct neck when more stable.
   .
   # anemia - baseline HCT ~30 at NEBH per OMR in 5/09per OMR (last in
   [**2139**]).
   - as above, transfuse for goal HCT>28, or CVP<[**10-8**].
   .
   # DM - cover with SSI while inpatient.
   .
   # ESRD on HD - will need to touch base with family re where dialysis
   occurs, and which days.
   - consult renal re hd.
   - renally dose meds.
   .
   # HTN - hold anti-hypertensive in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # CHF (EF 50-60%) - clinically euvolemic/dry.
   - hold lasix, ACE.
   .
   # CAD s/p MI, CABG - with h/o aflutter.
   - hold aspirin in setting of bleeding.
   .
   # DM2 - cover with SSI while inpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with hypotension. She has a past medical history of chronic heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post-aortofemoral bypass, and falls. The patient was found to be hypotensive despite receiving three units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and one liter of intravenous fluids (IVF) in the emergency department. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and atrial fibrillation as her heart rhythm.

The patient's physical examination revealed purple toes bilaterally and diminished but dopplerable dorsalis pedis (DP) pulses. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, along with low hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes hypotension, likely secondary to hypovolemic shock, with"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female admitted s/p fall and with significant blood loss in the
   setting of fall and blood loss with hemodialysis catheter removal.  She
   has had C-collar placed.  Patient now has shown some significant
   improvement in the capacity to tolerate PSV wean through to this
   morning and has been on SBT this morning with good tolerance.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with continued PSV support and will
   repeat RSBI in the morning following PSV support at this time.
   -Check ABG at end of 60 minute breathing trial today.
   -Return to PSV to continue support
   2)Hypotension-This may well have been a significant component of
   hypovolemia but this has been corrected and has had persistent
   hypotension with volume replete raising concern of cardiogenic
   contribution with persistent A-Fib with RVR and have been able to wean
   down but not off Levophed.
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -RV hypokinesis is of concern on ECHO and will have to consider further
   evaluation for source of obstructive shock at this time.
   -Would favor continued support with Levophed and move to evaluate for
   possible PE as unifying source
   -Check CvO2
   -Check CTA to evaluate PE if able
   -Continue with Amiodarone
   3)Chronic Renal Failure-Was on HD, will need to re-consider future
   goals of care and if in that light patient would need to continue to
   maintain adequate access with repeat placement of catheter.
   -Amiodarone
   -Levophed

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure after experiencing a fall and significant blood loss. The patient has shown improvement in tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient continues to require PSV support, and it is necessary to repeat the respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) in the morning following PSV support. If the RSBI remains high, the patient may not be able to tolerate extubation.
2) Hypotension - Despite correction of hypovolemia, the patient has persistent hypotension, which could be due to cardiogenic factors, such as atrial fibrillation with reduced ventricular function (AFib with RVR). The patient is currently on levophed, and further evaluation for a potential pulmonary embolism (PE) as a unifying source should be considered.
3) Chronic Renal Failure - The patient was on hemodialysis (HD), and future goals of care need to be reconsidered. If maintaining adequate access is necessary, repeat placement of the catheter may be required.

Additionally, the patient presents with altered mental status, shock (cardiogenic), impaired skin integrity, and an inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance, and cough)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and shock. They have impaired skin integrity and an inability to protect their airway, putting them at risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. The patient's family has requested comfort measures only, and they will be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway and risk for aspiration, there is a potential for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further complications like arrhythmias, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity, making them more susceptible to infections such as pressure ulcers or hospital-acquired infections.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as ""altered,"" it is not specifically labeled as delirium. However, given the patient's risk factors and the fact that they are at risk for aspiration, delirium should still be considered a potential complication.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's impaired ability to protect their airway increases the risk of gastric contents being aspirated into the lungs, leading to chemical pneumonitis or other gastrointestinal complications.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events indicate a change in code status from full code to comfort measures only, as requested by the patient's family. The patient also experienced invasive ventilation stoppage and arterial line stoppage. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 83/32 mmHg to 119/76 mmHg, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory system compliance of 28, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), and troponin T. Other lab values such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, and liver function tests are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals mild tachypnea, responsiveness to commands and questions, irregular and tachycardic cardiovascular system, bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, and soft non-tender abdomen.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, presenting with hypotension and subsequently intubated. She is currently under comfort care measures and the family wishes to take her home with hospice if possible. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/40 to 55/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient appears comfortable and is not in delirium.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, increased creatinine level of 7.0 mg/dL, and normal potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, cardiogenic shock, impaired skin integrity, and an inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough).

The plan of care includes providing comfort measures such as morphine and lorazepam as needed for pain and anxiety, continuing oxygen supplementation for dyspnea, and discontinuing further dialysis as per the patient and family's wishes. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI)."
