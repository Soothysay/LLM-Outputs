   Assessment and Plan
   1) Fevers/HOTN/septicemia:
   -Levophed for MAP goal >60
   -Check bladder pressure (?abd compartment syndrome)
   -Therapeutic para (w/albumin) incase ascites affecting BP, uop also
   down, and belly impinging on resp status.
   -Abd CT post therapeutic para
   -Unclear source of infection; ascites fluid not consistent with SBP.
   Given diarrhea C.diff is a possiblity although no recent antibiotic
   use.  Also consider infectious enteritis- viral or bacteria.  Cont
   empiric vanco/zosyn for now, f/u cxs including stool studies.
   2) Cirrhosis:  Not overtly encephalopathic currently, hold lactulose
   given h/o diarrhea.  Hyperbilirubinemia out of proportion to
   transaminitis.  RUQ U/S neg for [**Last Name (un) **].  Will ask liver service to
   evaluate.
   3) ARF:  B/l Cr ~1.  Uop dropping off significantly.  Intravascularly
   dry vs. abd compartment syndrome vs. HRS (less likely).  Checking urine
   lytes.  Cont midodrine and octreotide for now pending liver recs.
   4) Anemia:  Hct is slightly down from baseline, but stable no evidence
   of overt bleeding.  MCV chronically high.  Guaiac stools.
   5) ETOH abuse:  No evidence of withdrawal currently, will monitor.
   Added on ethanol level to admit labs.
   6) Hypoglycemia on admission: ?[**1-23**] NPO vs. infection vs. worsening
   liver dz.  Following finger sticks closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, grade II esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presented with increasing diarrhea and weakness, as well as a fall resulting in abdominal distension. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and received antibiotics, levophed, and a central venous line. Paracentesis revealed 148 WBCs and non-heme cells, and an echogenic mass on the liver was noted on ultrasound.

In the ICU, the patient required arterial line placement, hypotension management, and respiratory support. He also experienced hypoxemia that improved when sitting upright. Medications such as midodrine, octreotide, lasix, and albumin were administered. The patient's allergies, medical history, review of systems, and last dose of antibiotics are documented.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/77 mmHg to 80s, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4L NC. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support information are provided.

Physical examination revealed no acute distress, bibasilar crackles, shallow breaths, tense ascites, mild epigastric tenderness, muscle wasting, and venous stasis changes on the lower"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a chief complaint of increasing diarrhea, weakness, and rigors. He has a history of ETOH abuse and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted to the ICU with suspected sepsis, for which he received aggressive treatment including IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor support. He also has a diagnosis of cirrhosis, as indicated by an echogenic mass on his liver and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and laboratory findings suggest sepsis. His fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count indicate a systemic infection. The source of infection is currently unclear, and further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism.

2. Cirrhosis: The presence of an echogenic mass on the liver and elevated liver enzymes suggest chronic liver disease, likely cirrhosis. This condition may contribute to the patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and ascites.

3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to various causes, including Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), infectious enteritis, or other gastrointestinal disorders."

   Fevers/HOTN/septicemia:  Continue IVF an albumin in attempts to wean
   off levophed.  Unclear source.  Ascites fluid not consistent with SBP.
   Given diarrhea C.diff is possiblity although no recent antibiotic use.
   Also consider infectious enteritis such as viral or bacteria.
   Follow-up cultures including stool cultures, cover broadly pending
   cultures.
   Cirrhosis:  Not overtly encephalopathic currently, hold lactulose given
   GIB.
   Acute renal failure:  Baseline creatinine about 1, like is
   hypovolemic.  Can check urine lytes.
   Anemia:  Hct is slightly down from baseline, but not evidence of over
   bleading.  MCV is chronically high.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis, grade II esophageal varices, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presents with a 5-day history of increasing diarrhea, weakness, and rigors. He was unable to get out of the bathtub for a few hours and then fell down the stairs, denying head trauma. The patient also reports increasing abdominal distension.

Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and febrile. He received intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient underwent an arterial line placement, levophed titration, and a paracentesis that revealed 148 white blood cells and non-heme cells. An ultrasound showed no ductal dilatation but did reveal an echogenic mass on the liver.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/77 to 111/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters of nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure is 26 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 708 mL and output of 1300 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 422 mL.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, grade II esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presented with symptoms including increasing diarrhea, weakness, and rigors. He was unable to get out of his bathtub for a few hours and then fell down the stairs, denying head trauma. He also experienced increasing abdominal distension and diarrhea. The patient was found to have hypotension with a blood pressure in the 80s and fever. He received 5 liters of normal saline, vancomycin, zosyn, levophed, and CVL (code sepsis). 

The patient's arterial line was placed, and his levophed was titrated up and then back down. He experienced hypoxemia this morning, which improved significantly when sitting upright. He was started on midodrine and octreotide for possible hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOOD). A dose of lasix was given for possible pulmonary edema. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving multiple infusions including norepinephrine, meperidine, dextrose, furosemide, and pantoprazole. Other medications include octreotide, midodrine, albumin, and antibiotics. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with a 5-day history of increasing diarrhea, weakness, and rigors. He was unable to get out of the bathtub and subsequently fell down the stairs. The patient also reported increasing abdominal distension and diarrhea. In the emergency department, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 80s and febrile. He received intravenous fluids, vancomycin and zosyn antibiotics, levophed for blood pressure support, and a central line was placed due to code sepsis. The gastrointestinal team recommended albumin administration. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed 148 white blood cells and non-heme cells. An ultrasound showed no ductal dilatation but did reveal an echogenic mass on the liver.

24-hour events include the initiation of an arterial line and norepinephrine infusion. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies, and his last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin on 12/5/2162 at midnight. He is currently receiving various medications including norepinephrine, meperidine, dextrose, furosemide, and pantoprazole. His medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

Flow sheet data shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with complaints of diarrhea and weakness. Upon admission, the patient had multi-lumen and arterial line placements. The patient experienced declining oxygen saturation levels while lying in bed and was eventually able to sit up, which improved their comfort and oxygen saturation.

The patient's allergies were obtained from the patient, family/friend, and interpreter. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin on 12/5/2162 at 12:00 AM and Vancomycin on 12/5/2162 at 8:30 AM. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications including Meperidine (Demerol), Dextrose 50%, Furosemide (Lasix), and Pantoprazole (Protonix).

The patient's review of systems revealed fatigue, weight loss, dry mouth, abdominal pain, jaundice, and mild pain in the epigastrium. Flowsheet data indicated vital signs with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F) and 35.9 C (96.7 F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/53 mmHg to 91/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. Central venous pressure was 26 mmHg, bladder pressure was 16 mmHg, and fluid balance showed an intake of 708 mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   POST-CALL ADDENDUM: plan remains fairly similar to note of a few hours
   prior. Included here for reference.
   This is a 72 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices as well as type II diabetes and hypertension, who presents with
   diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness; consistent with
   sepsis.
   SEPSIS / HYPOTENSION / LEUKOCYTOSIS
   He appears to have a systemic infection, with lead suspects being
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (but his WBC on his ascites is too
   low to clearly rule in); cholecystitis (but an ultrasound showed no
   ductal dilatation); or intestinal perforation (but he has no focal
   tenderness, and although the ascites could mask this, one would have
   expected a somewhat more rapid course than the one Mr [**Known lastname 3239**] has
   described. Alternatively, he could have a variceal bleed causing
   weakness and diarrhea, which in the setting of mild fevers from
   inflammation or an unrelated illness could conceivably masquerade as
   sepsis. However, hematocrit was actually up in the evening after he
   came up from the ED; and there is no positive evidence of bleeding.
   -          Continue Zosyn + Vanco for broad empiric coverage; zosyn
   will cover likely SBP bugs; if not improving, could consider meropenem
   for ESBL organisms
   -          Follow up cultures drawn in ED including blood and
   peritoneal fluid; in addition, sending stool cultures including O+P and
   vibrio; UA appears clean
   -          Guaiac all stools
   -          Consider getting CT scan to rule out intestinal perforation;
   holding off for now given poor renal function but if continues to
   worsen could contemplate CT with oral contrast only.
   LIVER FAILURE
   Ongoing cirrhosis with acute bump in bilirubin. Bili bump gives concern
   for obstruction but RUQ US shows no evidence of dilatation of the
   ducts.
   -          Follow liver labs in AM
   -          Liver service consult in AM
   -          Octreotide and midodrine for ?hepatorenal physiology
   -          Albumin daily in SBP protocol
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely pre-renal in the setting of effective hypovolemia but may more
   specifically be hepatorenal syndrome.
   -          Will start octreotide and midodrine.
   -          Urine lytes.
   ANEMIA
   Low Hct on arrival. Has improved on the floor back up to near-baseline
   levels. Concern is bleeding vs hemolytic anemia, versus the more benign
   explanation of fluid shifts.
   -          type and cross
   -          serial Hcts
   -          transfuse for drop >3 pt or <25
   EtOH
   Per family in past, and as described in PCP notes, concern that patient
   is still drinking alcohol. Level or constancy of drinking unknown. No
   signs of withdrawal at this point.
   -  Monitor clinically for potential withdrawal sxs
   -  CIWA if starting to have signs of withdrawal
   -  follow and observe for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presents with symptoms of diarrhea, fevers and chills, severe weakness, and signs consistent with sepsis. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. His blood work reveals leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension/Leukocytosis: The patient shows signs of systemic infection with suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cholecystitis, or intestinal perforation. Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended, with consideration of meropenem for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) organisms if not improving.

2. Liver Failure: The patient's ongoing cirrhosis has led to an acute bump in bilirubin. A liver service consult should be obtained, and further evaluation of liver function is necessary.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to pre-renal causes related to effective hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Octreotide and midodrine may be initiated to address this issue.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels on arrival have improved, but there is concern about potential bleeding, hemolytic anemia, or fluid shifts"

The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presents with diarrhea, fevers, chills, and severe weakness, indicating sepsis. He also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia, and cirrhosis of the liver.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and weakness, along with low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, suggest sepsis. There is a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or other systemic infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia or another lung infection. Mechanical ventilation is being provided.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome secondary to cirrhosis and fluid overload.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. The cause could be bleeding, hemolysis, or fluid shifts.
5. Liver failure: The patient has ongoing cirrhosis with an acute increase in bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. There is concern for biliary obstruction, but imaging shows no evidence of ductal dilatation.

   This is a 72 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices as well as type II diabetes and hypertension, who presents with
   diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness; consistent with
   sepsis.
   HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   In setting of fluids, fluid overload secondary to new fluid bolus,
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   SEPSIS / HYPOTENSION / LEUKOCYTOSIS
   He appears to have a systemic infection, with lead suspects being
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (but his WBC on his ascites is too
   low to clearly rule in); cholecystitis (but an ultrasound showed no
   ductal dilatation); or intestinal perforation (but he has no focal
   tenderness, and although the ascites could mask this, one would have
   expected a somewhat more rapid course than the one Mr [**Known lastname 3239**] has
   described. Alternatively, he could have a variceal bleed causing
   weakness and diarrhea, which in the setting of mild fevers from
   inflammation or an unrelated illness could conceivably masquerade as
   sepsis. However, hematocrit was actually up in the evening after he
   came up from the ED; and there is no positive evidence of bleeding.
   -          Continue Zosyn + Vanco for broad empiric coverage; zosyn
   will cover likely SBP bugs; if not improving, could consider meropenem
   for ESBL organisms
   -          Follow up cultures drawn in ED including blood and
   peritoneal fluid; in addition, sending stool cultures including O+P and
   vibrio; UA appears clean
   -          Guaiac all stools
   -          Consider getting CT scan to rule out intestinal perforation;
   holding off for now given poor renal function but if continues to
   worsen could contemplate CT with oral contrast only.
   LIVER FAILURE
   Ongoing cirrhosis with acute bump in bilirubin. Bili bump gives concern
   for obstruction but RUQ US shows no evidence of dilatation of the
   ducts.
   -          Follow liver labs in AM
   -          Liver service consult in AM
   -          Octreotide and midodrine for ?hepatorenal physiology
   -          Albumin daily in SBP protocol
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely pre-renal in the setting of effective hypovolemia but may more
   specifically be hepatorenal syndrome.
   -          Will start octreotide and midodrine.
   -          Urine lytes.
   ANEMIA
   Low Hct on arrival. Has improved on the floor back up to near-baseline
   levels. Concern is bleeding vs hemolytic anemia, versus the more benign
   explanation of fluid shifts.
   -          type and cross
   -          serial Hcts
   -          transfuse for drop >3 pt or <25
   EtOH
   Per family in past, and as described in PCP notes, concern that patient
   is still drinking alcohol. Level or constancy of drinking unknown. No
   signs of withdrawal at this point.
   -  Monitor clinically for potential withdrawal sxs
   -  CIWA if starting to have signs of withdrawal
   -  follow and observe for now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presents with diarrhea, fevers, chills, severe weakness, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The assessment includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcohol abuse, acute renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome), anemia (other), cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), and hypotension.

The plan involves continuing Zosyn + Vanco for broad empiric coverage, follow-up cultures, guaiac all stools, consideration of a CT scan to rule out intestinal perforation, liver service consult in AM, octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal physiology, albumin daily in SBP protocol, and type and cross for anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient may develop an infection within the ascitic fluid, which can be a complication of cirrhosis.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease.

3. Variceal bleed: Esophageal varices can rupture and cause severe bleeding, leading to shock and potential death if not managed promptly.

4. Intestinal perforation: The presence of fever and abdominal pain could indicate a perforation in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices as well as type II diabetes and hypertension, who presents with
   diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness; consistent with
   sepsis.
   HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   In setting of fluids, fluid overload secondary to new fluid bolus,
   hepatorenal syndrome. Hemodialysis or CVVH likely the only way to treat
   this problem, but this would be in the setting of a poor prognosis and
   an earlier decision not to undergo liver transplant (per OMR note).

   Now growing gram-negative rods from ED cultures pre-abx. Other post-abx
   cultures not yet growing out anything. No speciation yet. Source is
   unclear. In setting of diarrhea he may have gut translocation;
   cholecystitis remains a possibility given wall thickening of gall
   bladder, although there was no ductal dilation, pt would be a very poor
   surgical candidate; GU source possible but not supported by original
   UA.
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - adding flagyl for complete coverage
   - follow up cultures
   LIVER FAILURE
   Ongoing cirrhosis with acute bump in bilirubin. Bili bump gives concern
   for obstruction but RUQ US shows no evidence of dilatation of the
   ducts.
   -          Follow liver labs in AM
   -          Liver service consult in AM
   -          Octreotide and midodrine for ?hepatorenal physiology
   -          Albumin daily in SBP protocol
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely pre-renal in the setting of effective hypovolemia but may more
   specifically be hepatorenal syndrome.
   -          Will start octreotide and midodrine.
   -          Urine lytes.
   ANEMIA
   Low Hct on arrival. Has improved on the floor back up to near-baseline
   levels. Concern is bleeding vs hemolytic anemia, versus the more benign
   explanation of fluid shifts.
   -          type and cross
   -          serial Hcts
   -          transfuse for drop >3 pt or <25
   EtOH
   Per family in past, and as described in PCP notes, concern that patient
   is still drinking alcohol. Level or constancy of drinking unknown. No
   signs of withdrawal at this point.
   -  Monitor clinically for potential withdrawal sxs
   -  CIWA if starting to have signs of withdrawal
   -  follow and observe for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presents with diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness, which are consistent with sepsis. 

The patient underwent paracentesis and invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The cultures from the ED show growing gram-negative rods, and the source of infection is unclear. The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl. 

The patient also has signs of liver failure with a recent bump in bilirubin levels, but there is no evidence of ductal dilation on RUQ US. The liver service has been consulted, and the patient will receive octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal physiology. 

There is concern about the patient's renal function, which is likely pre-renal due to effective hypovolemia. The patient may have hepatorenal syndrome, and measures such as octreotide and midodrine will be initiated. 

The patient has anemia with a low Hct on arrival, but it has improved on the floor. The type and cross have been ordered, along with serial Hcts. The patient will be transfused if there is a drop of >3 pt or <25% from baseline. 

The patient's EtOH level is negative, but there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices as well as type II diabetes and hypertension, who presents with
   diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness; consistent with
   sepsis.
   HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   In setting of fluids, fluid overload secondary to new fluid bolus,
   hepatorenal syndrome. Hemodialysis or CVVH likely the only way to treat
   this problem, but this would be in the setting of a poor prognosis and
   an earlier decision not to undergo liver transplant (per OMR note).
   Plan to discuss with family; see below re goals of care.
   SEPSIS / HYPOTENSION / LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Now growing gram-negative rods from ED cultures pre-abx. Other post-abx
   cultures not yet growing out anything. No speciation yet. Source is
   unclear. In setting of diarrhea he may have gut translocation;
   cholecystitis remains a possibility given wall thickening of gall
   bladder, although there was no ductal dilation, pt would be a very poor
   surgical candidate; GU source possible but not supported by original
   UA.
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - adding flagyl for complete coverage
   - follow up cultures
   LIVER FAILURE
   Ongoing cirrhosis with acute bump in bilirubin. Bili bump gives concern
   for obstruction but RUQ US shows no evidence of dilatation of the
   ducts. Bilirubin still rising in setting of relatively low liver
   enzymes; however this may reflect end-stage cirrhosis more than lack of
   inflammation.
   - Appreciate liver service recommendations
   - given that pt declined transplant earlier, pt is not a transplant
   candidate
   - continuing octreotide and midodrine to support circulation but
   unlikely to provide substantial improvement as he has worsened on these
   - if further pressor support needed could consider vasopressin for
   possible differential effect on splanchnic circulation
   - further albumin likely would not be of benefit for now
   RENAL FAILURE
   Non fluid-responsive; urine output has not responded to albumin or
   fluids. Picture continuing to be consistent with hepatorenal syndrome;
   no evidence of SBP on second tap; renal failure not c/w ATN.
   GOALS OF CARE
   Given the above it is very unlikely that Mr [**Known lastname 3239**] will be able to
   make a meaningful recovery. We will discuss his prognosis with his
   family today to consider overall goals of care in the setting of end
   stage liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome. He has been full code
   after initially asking for resuscitation but not intubation as his code
   status.
   ANEMIA
   Low Hct on arrival. Has improved on the floor back up to near-baseline
   levels. Concern is bleeding vs hemolytic anemia, versus the more benign
   explanation of fluid shifts. Guaiac positive but not losing blood at a
   brisk place. This is secondary concern currently although if he were to
   stabilize and regain his own blood pressure might want to consider
   restarting beta blocker for prevention of variceal bleed. No indication
   of variceal rupture.
   EtOH
   EtOH level negative on arrival per add-on lab value. Likely no
   indication for CIWA.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness, consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, liver failure, renal failure, anemia, and potential goals of care discussion due to end-stage liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and weakness indicate an infection, which has been confirmed by the presence of gram-negative rods from ED cultures. This suggests sepsis, and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and need for emergency intubation indicate severe respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Liver Failure: The patient's ongoing cirrhosis with an acute increase in bilirubin suggests acute liver dysfunction. Further evaluation by the liver service is recommended, and the patient may require additional interventions such as octreotide and midodrine to support circulation.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's non-responsive urine output indicates renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. Hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration may be necessary to manage this condition.

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   This is a 72 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices as well as type II diabetes and hypertension, who presents with
   diarrhea, fevers and chills, and severe weakness; consistent with
   sepsis.
   SEPSIS / HYPOTENSION / LEUKOCYTOSIS
   He appears to have a systemic infection, with lead suspects being
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (but his WBC on his ascites is too
   low to clearly rule in); cholecystitis (but an ultrasound showed no
   ductal dilatation); or intestinal perforation (but he has no focal
   tenderness, and although the ascites could mask this, one would have
   expected a somewhat more rapid course than the one Mr [**Known lastname 3239**] has
   described. Alternatively, he could have a variceal bleed causing
   weakness and diarrhea, which in the setting of mild fevers from
   inflammation or an unrelated illness could conceivably masquerade as
   sepsis. However, hematocrit was actually up in the evening after he
   came up from the ED; and there is no positive evidence of bleeding.
   -          Continue Zosyn + Vanco for broad empiric coverage; zosyn
   will cover likely SBP bugs; if not improving, could consider meropenem
   for ESBL organisms
   -          Follow up cultures drawn in ED including blood and
   peritoneal fluid; in addition, sending stool cultures including O+P and
   vibrio; UA appears clean
   -          Guaiac all stools
   -          Consider getting CT scan to rule out intestinal perforation;
   holding off for now given poor renal function but if continues to
   worsen could contemplate CT with oral contrast only.
   LIVER FAILURE
   Ongoing cirrhosis with acute bump in bilirubin. Bili bump gives concern
   for obstruction but RUQ US shows no evidence of dilatation of the
   ducts.
   -          Follow liver labs in AM
   -          Liver service consult in AM
   -          Octreotide and midodrine for ?hepatorenal physiology
   -          Albumin daily in SBP protocol
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely pre-renal in the setting of effective hypovolemia but may more
   specifically be hepatorenal syndrome.
   -          Will start octreotide and midodrine.
   -          Urine lytes.
   ANEMIA
   Low Hct on arrival. Has improved on the floor back up to near-baseline
   levels. Concern is bleeding vs hemolytic anemia, versus the more benign
   explanation of fluid shifts.
   -          type and cross
   -          serial Hcts
   -          transfuse for drop >3 pt or <25
   EtOH
   Per family in past, and as described in PCP notes, concern that patient
   is still drinking alcohol. Level or constancy of drinking unknown. No
   signs of withdrawal at this point.
   -  Monitor clinically for potential withdrawal sxs
   -  CIWA if starting to have signs of withdrawal
   -  follow and observe for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He presented with diarrhea, fevers, and severe weakness, which are consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, anemia, cirrhosis of the liver, and other conditions. He underwent paracentesis to remove 3 liters of ascites fluid, which was sent for culture and cytology. The patient also required invasive ventilation after experiencing respiratory decline following a fluid bolus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, chills, and severe weakness. He appeared to have a systemic infection, with possible suspects being spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cholecystitis, intestinal perforation, or variceal bleed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status declined after the fluid bolus, leading to the need for emergent intubation. This indicates respiratory failure, which may be due to ARDS or another underlying cause.
3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which contributes to his cirrhosis and other complications. Continued monitoring for potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms is necessary.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's ongoing cirrhosis with an acute bump in bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man with PMH etoh chirossis who presents with high grade
   GNR bacteremia, progressive hepatic failure, acute renal failure and
   now hypoxemic respiratory failure. Prognosis is clearly very grim with
   MODS and underlying hepatic failure. Currently on vanc/zosyn/cipro and
   awaitng  speciatiation. Culutres pending. Possible sources include gut,
   urine or (less likely) lung. Will add flagyl today given diarrhea on
   presentation. Chest/Abdmn/Pelvis CT today. Given rapid clearing of CXR,
   suspect aspiration as etiology of respiratory failure but could have a
   component of fluid overload as well. Will drop tidal volume today to
   6cc/kg IBW, oxygenation seems improved. Renal failure looks more c/w
   HRS than sepsis related ATN - no response to volume so will try to run
   even today. RRT therapy is difficult in this case as he does not appear
   to be a transplant candidate (refused eval in the past, some evidence
   of active drinking). We will arrange family meeting today in regards to
   goals of care. This does not appear to be a surviveable event. Further
   plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis, known liver mass (HCC), and known varices. He presented with weakness, hypotension, and now has high-grade GNR bacteremia, new renal failure, and intubated overnight due to hemoptysis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is grim with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and underlying hepatic failure. He is currently on vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin and awaiting culture results. Possible sources of the bacteremia include the gut, urine, or lung. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, and a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT will be done today. The rapid clearing of the chest X-ray suggests aspiration as the etiology of respiratory failure, but fluid overload may also be a factor. The tidal volume will be reduced to 6cc/kg IBW today, and oxygenation seems improved. The renal failure appears to be consistent with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) rather than sepsis-related acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is challenging in this case due to the patient's refusal of transplant evaluation and evidence of active alcohol consumption. A family meeting will be arranged today to discuss goals of care. This does not appear to be a survivable event. Further plans will be per resident note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, known liver mass possible hepatocellular carcinoma, and known varices. He was admitted with weakness and hypotension and now has high-grade gram-negative bacilli bacteremia, new renal failure, and intubated overnight due to hemoptysis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been weaned off pressors but developed hemoptysis and respiratory failure. He has been given albumin replacement and all his medications are documented. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his respiratory status is concerning. He has decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. The patient's laboratory values indicate worsening hepatic and renal function, as well as electrolyte imbalances. Microbiology results show gram-negative rods in the blood culture. The patient's prognosis is grim with multiorgan system failure and underlying hepatic failure. Cultures are pending, and possible sources of infection include the gut, urine, or lung. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade GNR bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's worsening hepatic function, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has new-onset renal failure, which can worsen if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of diarrhea and weakness, who has since developed acute liver failure and multiorgan failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is sedated, encephalopathic, unresponsive, and has a language barrier.

The patient's code status was previously set to full code but has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate) with comfort measures after discussion with the family. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and pressors.

The patient's vital signs show hypothermia with a maximum temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F) and current temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.4Â°F). The heart rate is bradycardic at 53 bpm, blood pressure is low at 100/52 mmHg, respiratory rate is on mechanical ventilation with a set rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 97% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals the presence of an endotracheal tube and OG tube, distant heart sounds, cool and edematous extremities without pulses, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, distended abdomen with bowel sounds and large ascites, and evidence of jaundice. Neurological assessment indicates unresponsiveness to voice and mild tactile stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented with complaints of diarrhea and weakness. He has been diagnosed with acute liver failure, multiorgan failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently sedated, unresponsive, and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia. He has jaundice, muscle wasting, and edematous extremities without pulses. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is also diagnosed with respiratory failure, anemia, cirrhosis of the liver, and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Due to acute liver failure, the patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to multiorgan failure, prolonged immobility, and invasive procedures such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which increases the risk of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy can lead to increased bleeding risk.
5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia."

   Hepatorenal syndrome; also with likely sepsis/peri-sepsis; antibiotics
   unlikely to be a solution but rather only ameliorate what is now a
   near-certain decline.
   After discussion with family, team and family agree to no escalation of
   care. They will be trying to get as many of his 15 children in to see
   him today as possible. He is unresponsive and his blood pressure is
   gradually dropping even in the setting of sepsis. Would expect death to
   be imminent, likely today at current rate of dropping BP.
   Maintaining current care, making no increase in pressors, continuing
   antibiotics on the basis that fever is uncomfortable and he may retain
   some sensation and consciousness, will continue to discuss goals of
   care with patient
s family; consider extubation and comfort care if
   family feels that this is in patient
s best interest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of diarrhea and weakness. He was diagnosed with acute liver failure, multiorgan failure, and sepsis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently unresponsive due to sedation. He has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and no escalation of care. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 100/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's acute liver failure may lead to hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure caused by severe liver disease.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can worsen if not properly managed. It can cause organ dysfunction and potentially lead to septic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. If the ventilator settings are not adjusted correctly or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the MICU with hepatorenal syndrome and respiratory failure. The goals of care have been transitioned to comfort. The patient is currently unresponsive to voice and mild tactile stimuli, indicating a severe level of sedation or unconsciousness.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 88/42 mmHg) and hypoxemia (SpO2: 81%). The heart rhythm is normal (SR - Sinus Rhythm). The patient has distended abdomen with large ascites and cool, edematous extremities without palpable pulses. These findings suggest advanced liver disease and complications such as portal hypertension and peripheral vasoconstriction.

The lab results indicate deranged renal function (Cr: 1.8 - 4.8 mg/dL) and hepatic dysfunction (ALT/AST: 49/76, Alk Phos/T Bili: 70/12.9). There is also evidence of electrolyte imbalances (Na+: 143 mg/dL, K+: 4.8 mEq/L, Cl-: 88 mg/dL, HCO3 -: 20 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (Glucose: 53 mg/dL).

The patient's condition is critical, and potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in renal function, development of"
