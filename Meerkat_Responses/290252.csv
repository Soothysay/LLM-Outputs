   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Given her presentation of acute shortness of breath, and recent
   weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf for etiology include
   DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to ischemic event or
   pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of infection other
   than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On [**Year (4 digits) 7087**] appears to
   have DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started heparin drip overnight and
   will followup with echo today. Radiology noted on prelim read of CTA
   this morning that patient has large clot in R mainstem bronchus.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - f/u echo
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension overnight
   - treat heart block as below
   - ceftriaxone/azithro for CAP
   -sputum culture
   - cont CPAP
   .
   # hypotension: ? PE vs sepsis from UTI vs cardiac event (CE negative as
   above). Given positive [**Last Name (LF) 7087**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check echo for right sided strain
   and also for any new wall motion abnormalities. Very unlikely to be
   secondary to sepsis given lack of white count, fever and clinically
   stable. Also this could be somehow related to her bradycardia and newly
   diagnosed 2^nd degree heart block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - ctx/azithro for CAP, UTI
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS and follow UOP
   -f/u ECHO
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - f/u echo
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.
   - ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved this
   morning with hydration overnight.
   - would discontinue IVF and allow PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once HD stable, she may need lasix given her edema

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with shortness of breath, recent weight gain, and increasing edema. Physical examination revealed crackles at the bases of the lungs, tenderness in the right calf, and warm skin. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose, lactic acid, and creatinine levels. An echocardiogram revealed a large clot in the right mainstem bronchus. The patient was started on heparin and supplemental oxygen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension overnight. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI), or a cardiac event. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Heart block: The patient has a new second-degree heart block (Wenckebach-Mobitz type I). Possible causes include progression of calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess, or medications. If the patient's symptoms are attributed to bradycardia, she may be a candidate for a pacemaker.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of DVT in the popliteal vein on the right side. Heparin has been initiated, and further evaluation with a follow-up echocardiogram is"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p

   .
   # SOB: given history, including 25 lb weight gain and profound LE
   edema, raises concern for CHF although most recent ECHO showed
   resolution of LV function and no significant pulmonary edema on CXR.
   Its possible she has had some worsening of her LV function due to
   missed ischemic event, current silent ischemia, or bradycardia with new
   weinkeboch on ECG. [**Month (only) 60**] also have some element of pneumonia given
   infiltrate on CXR.  Must also consider PE as pt on Evista and has LE
   swelling with painful calves which may also explain R>L sided failure
   on exam. [**Month (only) 60**] also have contribution of OSA as seems that patient has
   not been entirely compliant with CPAP.
   - add on BNP
   - supplemental O2
   - hold beta blocker, ace-inhibitor in the setting of hypotension and ?
   CHF exacerbation
   - repeat ECHO in am to assess for interval change
   - treat heart block as below

   - cycle cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs to rule out silent ischemia
   - check VBG with lactate
   - LENIs to eval for DVT. Can consider CTA to eval for PE if evidence of
   elevated PA pressures or RV strain on ECHO
   - cont CPAP at night

   # hypotension: must consider sepsis secondary to UTI or pna as etiology
   although somewhat strange that patient has no leukocytosis or left
   shift.  According to prior clinic notes, patient's baseline BP seems to
   be SBP in low 100s. Currently no symptoms of LH, chest pain, and making
   urine. Could also be cardiogenic in the setting of bradycardia and new
   weinkeboch as well as due to worsening CHF or ischemia although no
   history of chest pain.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She presents with shortness of breath, profound lower extremity edema, and a recent weight gain of 25 pounds. The patient has been on Evista and shows signs of possible pulmonary embolism (PE) with right-sided failure on examination. She also has evidence of pneumonia with an infiltrate on chest X-ray. There is a concern for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, silent ischemia, and bradycardia with new Wenckebach on ECG. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachypnea, and low-grade fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) exacerbation - The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, profound lower extremity edema, and weight gain raise concerns for CHF exacerbation. Treatment includes diuretics, holding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in the setting of hypotension, and repeating an echocardiogram to assess for interval changes.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient's symptoms of lower extremity edema, painful calves, and right-sided failure on examination suggest the possibility of PE. Further evaluation may include a CT angiogram (CTA) to assess for PE, especially if there is evidence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures or right"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Given her presentation of acute shortness of breath, and recent
   weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf for etiology include
   DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to ischemic event or
   pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of infection other
   than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On [**Year (4 digits) 7087**] appears to
   have DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started heparin drip overnight and
   will followup with echo today. Radiology noted on prelim read of CTA
   this morning that patient has large clot in R mainstem bronchus.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - f/u echo
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension overnight
   - treat heart block as below
   - ceftriaxone/azithro for CAP
   -sputum culture
   - cont CPAP
   .
   # hypotension: ? PE vs sepsis from UTI vs cardiac event (CE negative as
   above). Given positive [**Last Name (LF) 7087**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check echo for right sided strain
   and also for any new wall motion abnormalities. Very unlikely to be
   secondary to sepsis given lack of white count, fever and clinically
   stable. Also this could be somehow related to her bradycardia and newly
   diagnosed 2^nd degree heart block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - ctx/azithro for CAP, UTI
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS and follow UOP
   -f/u ECHO
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - f/u echo
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.
   - ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved this
   morning with hydration overnight.
   - would discontinue IVF and allow PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once HD stable, she may need lasix given her edema
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitis: on glipizide, raloxifene as outpt.
   - hold oral meds
   - ISS
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: has been noncompliant in past with CPAP due
   to poorly fitting mask.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Given her presentation of acute shortness of breath, and recent
   weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf for etiology include
   DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to ischemic event or
   pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of infection other
   than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On [**Year (4 digits) 7087**] appears to
   have DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started heparin drip overnight and
   will followup with echo today. Radiology noted on prelim read of CTA
   this morning that patient has large clot in R mainstem bronchus.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - f/u echo
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension overnight
   - treat heart block as below
   - ceftriaxone/azithro for CAP
   -sputum culture
   - cont CPAP
   .
   # hypotension: ? PE vs sepsis from UTI vs cardiac event (CE negative as
   above). Given positive [**Last Name (LF) 7087**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check echo for right sided strain
   and also for any new wall motion abnormalities. Very unlikely to be
   secondary to sepsis given lack of white count, fever and clinically
   stable. Also this could be somehow related to her bradycardia and newly
   diagnosed 2^nd degree heart block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - ctx/azithro for CAP, UTI
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS and follow UOP
   -f/u ECHO
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - f/u echo
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.
   - ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved this
   morning with hydration overnight.
   - would discontinue IVF and allow PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once HD stable, she may need lasix given her edema

   breath, and recent weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf

   ischemic event or pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of
   infection other than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On

   heparin drip night of admission.  CTA shows R lung PE and evidence of R
   heart strain.  Echo with preserved EF, NL RV size and free wall motion.
   Trival MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] evidence of right heart strain. Theory is that PE is
   subacute given increasing edema over last month. Increased heart
   strain, possible UTI exacerbated strain on heart causing development of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute shortness of breath and recent weight gain with increasing edema. The main concern for etiology includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), worsening heart failure secondary to ischemic event or pulmonary infection. 

The patient has no evidence of infection other than in her urine, with negative cardiac enzymes. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) shows right lung PE and evidence of right heart strain. An echocardiogram reveals preserved ejection fraction (EF), normal right ventricular (RV) size and free wall motion, and trivial mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The patient's arterial blood gases (ABG) show a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 29 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 60 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 177 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 18 mg/dL, glucose of 126 mg/dL, and troponin T of less than 0.01 ng/mL. 

The patient is on supplemental oxygen, continuous heparin infusion, and monitoring of coagulation parameters. She is also on coumadin 5 mg daily, with INR trending. Antihypertensive medications are held due to transient hypotension. The patient's heart block is being treated as described below. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension, bradycardia/heart block, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury (AKI), and potential need for pacemaker placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is currently on heparin due to a pulmonary embolism in the right lung. However, the patient's PTT remained elevated overnight, suggesting that the heparin therapy may not be effective. Additionally, there is evidence of right heart strain on the CT scan. The patient also has chronic right popliteal occlusion.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 71 to 137 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal limits, but the patient has a second-degree AV block Wenckebach (Mobitz I) rhythm. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the patient's oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, increased creatinine level, and significantly elevated glucose level. The troponin-T level is below the normal range, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently being treated for hypotension, complete heart block, deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

ICU Care:

The patient's nutritional needs are being met, with a goal of maintaining glycemic control. The patient has multiple"

   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.

   # SOB: Given her presentation of acute shortness of breath, and recent
   weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf for etiology include
   DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to ischemic event or
   pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of infection other
   than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On [**Year (4 digits) 7087**] appears to
   have DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started heparin drip overnight and
   will followup with echo today. Radiology noted on prelim read of CTA
   this morning that patient has large clot in R mainstem bronchus.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - f/u echo
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension overnight
   - treat heart block as below
   - ceftriaxone/azithro for CAP
   -sputum culture
   - cont CPAP
   .
   # hypotension: ? PE vs sepsis from UTI vs cardiac event (CE negative as
   above). Given positive [**Last Name (LF) 7087**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check echo for right sided strain
   and also for any new wall motion abnormalities. Very unlikely to be
   secondary to sepsis given lack of white count, fever and clinically
   stable. Also this could be somehow related to her bradycardia and newly
   diagnosed 2^nd degree heart block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - ctx/azithro for CAP, UTI
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS and follow UOP
   -f/u ECHO
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - f/u echo
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.
   - ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved this
   morning with hydration overnight.
   - would discontinue IVF and allow PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once HD stable, she may need lasix given her edema

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, heart block, deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, and acute pain. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 mmHg to 170/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and various medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Heart Block: The patient's complete heart block may progress and require pacemaker insertion for stable heart rhythm.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and could be indicative of septic shock or other underlying causes.
5. Fever: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response that needs to be addressed.
6. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which requires appropriate pain management to ensure comfort and prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Worsening cough today on exam, as well as unresolved tachypnea
   is concerning for an underlying process. CXR looks unchanged from
   previous (awaiting final read by radiology). This may be secondary to
   PE burden and resulting bronchospasm, pulmonary edema secondary to R
   heart strain, or underlying infection. Also notable is her elevated WBC
   and low-grade fever. Will try nebs, low dose IV lasix, and will
   consider antibiotics. Not certain if it is aspiration vs. HAP. Will
   cover broadly if radiology confirms a new finding on CXR. The most
   concerning thing at this point would be her PE burden increasing, and
   if she decompensates may need TPA.
   -monitor for worsening tachypnea, o2 requirements
   -albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   -started on Heparin drip and bridging to coumadin (monitor coags)
   - f/u CXR read, if c/w new PNA start broad coverage abx
   -f/u sputum cx
   - cont CPAP at night
   - check blood gas
   -20mg IV lasix x1 and monitor for improvement on exam
   .
   # hypotension: Currently stable and likely at her baseline. Will hold
   off on restarting any of her antihypertensives at this time. Will also
   work on placing A-line in case she decompensates.
   - abx as above, touch base with ID if needed
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS, very preload dependent given PE.
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this.
   - currently stable
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.  Will repeat urine analysis and
   culture.
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: resolved with hydration
   -PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitis: on glipizide, raloxifene as outpt.
   - increased sliding scale
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: has been noncompliant in past with CPAP due
   to poorly fitting mask.
   - CPAP in hospital
   .
   # Gastroesophageal reflux disease: cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Anemia: at most recent baseline.
   .
   # restless legs: cont mirapex, ultram, lyrica
   .
   # osteoarthritis: calcium, vit D, hold raloxefene

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, who presents with shortness of breath. She has worsening cough, unresolved tachypnea, and low-grade fever. Her WBC count is elevated. She has bilateral crackles with wheezes audible on exam when sitting up. She also has tender RUQ, no rebound/guarding, not distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, and warm, well-perfused 2+dp pulses with stable 3+ peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, worsening cough, and tachypnea, along with her history of immobilization and risk factors for thromboembolism, raise concern for a potential PE. Further diagnostic tests such as a CT pulmonary angiogram or D-dimer should be considered.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and the presence of bilateral crackles with wheezes suggest a possibility of heart failure exacerbation. Close monitoring of her vital signs, fluid balance, and cardiac function is essential.
3. Infection: The elevated WBC count and low-grade fever indicate the possibility of an underlying infection. Cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Multifactorial. Given her presentation of acute shortness of
   breath, and recent weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf
   for etiology included DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to
   ischemic event or pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of
   infection other than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes were negative. On
   LENIs appears to have chronic DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started
   heparin drip night of admission.  CTA shows R lung PE and evidence of R
   heart strain.  Echo with preserved EF, NL RV size and free wall motion.
   Trival MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] evidence of right heart strain. Theory is that PE is
   subacute given increasing edema over last month. Increased heart
   strain, possible UTI exacerbated strain on heart causing development of
   new arrythymia and worsening SOB.  Pt was sent to floor today, but
   developed tachypnea/SOB after coughing while eating.  Transferred back
   to ICU
 stable with decreased resp rate on 4L NRB
   -plan to run trial on NC O2
   -started on Heparin drip and bridging to coumadin
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - started coumadin 5 mg today, trend INR
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension
   - treat heart block as below
   - d/ced azithro yesterday once clear lung process [**3-1**] PE. No longer
   feel PNA likely
   - cont CPAP at night
   - check blood gas and CXR in AM
   .
   # hypotension: Known PE as above likely contributing. Sepsis from UTI
   unlikely given no other SIRS physiology. Cardiac event unlikely given
   neg CE.. Very unlikely to be secondary to sepsis given lack of white
   count, fever and clinically stable. Also this could be somehow related
   to her bradycardia and newly diagnosed 2^nd degree heart
   block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - On CTX for possible UTI but U cult NG so far, asymptomatic. Check
   Urine sediment today given overnight R flank pain (responded to
   Tylenol), if neg d/c CTX as completing 3 day course anyway
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS, very preload dependent given PE.
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.  U culture NG to date
   - ceftriaxone to be stopped after neg ua/urine sediment.
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved
   since admit with hydration overnight.   Last CR 1.1
 resolved.
   -PO intake to avoid fluid overload

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with shortness of breath, recent weight gain, and increasing edema. The main concern for etiology includes deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), worsening heart failure secondary to an ischemic event or pulmonary infection.

The patient has chronic DVT in the popliteal vein on the right leg, as seen on lower extremity venous (LENI) scan. She started on heparin drip the night of admission. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) shows right lung PE and evidence of right heart strain. An echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction (EF), normal right ventricular (RV) size, and free wall motion was performed.

The patient developed tachypnea/shortness of breath after coughing while eating and was transferred back to the ICU. She is currently stable with decreased respiratory rate on 4 liters nasal cannula (NC) oxygen. The plan is to continue running a trial on NC O2, start on heparin drip and bridge to coumadin, supplemental O2, continue heparin, and monitor coagulation parameters.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to the known PE. Sepsis from urinary tract infection (UTI) is unlikely given no other systemic inflammatory"

   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Worsening cough today on exam, as well as unresolved tachypnea
   is concerning for an underlying process. CXR looks unchanged from
   previous (awaiting final read by radiology). This may be secondary to
   PE burden and resulting bronchospasm, pulmonary edema secondary to R
   heart strain, or underlying infection. Also notable is her elevated WBC
   and low-grade fever. Will try nebs, low dose IV lasix, and will
   consider antibiotics. Not certain if it is aspiration vs. HAP. Will
   cover broadly if radiology confirms a new finding on CXR. The most
   concerning thing at this point would be her PE burden increasing, and
   if she decompensates may need TPA.
   -monitor for worsening tachypnea, o2 requirements
   -albuterol, ipratropium nebs

   .
   # hypotension: Currently stable and likely at her baseline. Will hold
   off on restarting any of her antihypertensives at this time. Will also
   work on placing A-line in case she decompensates.
   - abx as above, touch base with ID if needed
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and other medical conditions. She was admitted with shortness of breath and has since developed several medical complications.

1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening cough, unresolved tachypnea, and elevated WBC count suggest an underlying process, potentially pneumonia. The CXR is unchanged from previous, but a new finding may indicate an infection. Antibiotics have been started to cover broadly.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's PE burden is a concern, and there is a risk of it increasing. If she decompensates, thrombolytic therapy (TPA) may be needed. Monitoring for worsening tachypnea and oxygen requirements is essential.

3. Bradycardia/heart block: The patient has a new Wenckebach (Mobitz Type I) second-degree AV block. Possible causes include progression of calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess, or medications. If asymptomatic, no further treatment may be necessary.

   # SOB: Worsening cough may be secondary to PE burden or newly dx PNA,
   likely secondary to aspiration Also notable is her elevated WBC and
   low-grade fever. Will try nebs, low dose IV lasix, and will continue
   antibiotics. Not certain if it is aspiration vs. HAP. The most
   concerning thing at this point would be her PE burden increasing, and
   if she decompensates may need TPA. A line in place if needs ABGs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, pain, fever, hypotension, heart block, deep vein thrombosis, and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can potentially lead to complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction.

2. Heart Block: The patient is experiencing a complete heart block, which can result in decreased cardiac output and potentially lead to shock or cardiac arrest if not properly managed.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a diagnosis of DVT, which can increase the risk of pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges from the leg veins and travels to the lungs.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

5. Fever: The patient has a fever, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response that could be related to an infection or another underlying condition.

6. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating a need for close monitoring and management of blood sugar levels to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

7. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated"

   multifactorial.  She definitely has pulmonary embolism.  Her response
   to Lasix (decrease in RR 2-3 hours after Lasix
 see chart below) is
   highly suggest of pulmonary edema, and she was clinically felt to have
   aspiration on the floor before return to the ICU.

   We will continue heparin.
   We will diurese again today, though she may be too preload dependent to
   allow this.
   We will continue antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia,
   completing an 8-day course.
   We have changed all meds to not include D5, and are titrating up her
   insulin for uncontrolled diabetes.
   Her bradycardia is improving; we will follow daily EKGs to follow her
   Wenckebach.
   We will maintain her in the ICU for now given her respiratory distress,
   hypoxemia, and unclear trajectory.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old woman with respiratory distress. The cause of her respiratory distress appears to be multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, and possible aspiration. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring due to her hypoxemia and unclear trajectory.

The patient has been on heparin therapy, which will be continued. Lasix has been administered to address the pulmonary edema, but further diuresis may not be feasible due to her preload dependency. Antibiotics have been initiated to cover for possible nosocomial pneumonia, with an 8-day course planned. Insulin therapy is being titrated to manage her uncontrolled diabetes.

The patient's bradycardia is improving, and daily EKGs will be conducted to monitor her Wenckebach rhythm. The arterial line placed on [2105-1-17] 05:00 PM will aid in continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent arterial blood gas analysis.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. Allergies include aspirin and niacin. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone on [2105-1-15] 04:00 PM, clindamycin on [2105-1-17] 12:47 AM, vancomycin on [2105-1-17] 06:04 PM, and piper"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with respiratory distress. The note indicates that the patient has a multifactorial cause for her respiratory distress, including pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, and aspiration. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Pulmonary embolism: This refers to a blood clot that has traveled to the lungs, causing blockage of blood flow. It can lead to severe shortness of breath, chest pain, and even cardiac arrest if not promptly treated.

2. Pulmonary edema: This is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and coughing. It can be caused by heart failure, kidney failure, or other underlying conditions. Prompt management with diuretics and oxygen therapy is crucial to prevent further complications.

3. Aspiration: Aspiration occurs when foreign material, such as food, saliva, or gastric contents, enters the lungs. This can result in pneumonia and other respiratory infections. The patient's aspiration on the floor before returning to the ICU increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.

4. Nosocomial pneumonia: This is a type of pneumonia acquired during hospitalization. The patient is receiving antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia, indicating that there may be an increased risk of developing this infection due to her prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, who was admitted for shortness of breath. The patient presented with symptoms of pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. She had intermittent low-grade fevers but showed improvement in oxygen requirements and cough. The patient is currently on antibiotics for pneumonia, heparin with a bridge to coumadin for pulmonary embolism, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia/Heart Block: The patient has a known first-degree heart block and recently developed a Wenckebach-Mobitz type I (second-degree AV block) on ECG. There is concern for junctional tachycardia, but the patient is asymptomatic and the PR prolongation appears to be stable. Holding nodal agents like metoprolol and amitriptyline is recommended, and monitoring for any decompensation with an EKG is advised.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range and only slightly hypertensive when off CPAP. However, there was an episode of hypo overnight. Close monitoring of blood pressure and using IV Lasix as needed is recommended. Holding hypertension medications for now is advised.

3. UTI: The patient's urine culture was negative, and she is asymptomatic. Waiting for the urine culture results is recommended.

4. Acute Kidney Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia, pain control (acute and chronic), fever, hypotension, heart block, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include blood cultures drawn, increased glargine dosage, and administration of antibiotics (clindamycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin). The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as omeprazole.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), blood pressure ranging from 134/68 mmHg to 153/78 mmHg, heart rate between 93 and 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has an ABG result of ///27/. 

Physical examination findings include an ECG showing a second-degree AV block Mobitz I (Wenckebach), but peripheral pulses and skin were not assessed due to technical issues. Neurologic examination was also not performed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin levels, along with abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab"

   .
   # SOB: Worsening cough may be secondary to PE burden or newly dx PNA,
   likely secondary to aspiration Also notable is her elevated WBC and
   low-grade fever. Will try nebs, low dose IV lasix, and will continue
   antibiotics. Not certain if it is aspiration vs. HAP. The most
   concerning thing at this point would be her PE burden increasing, and
   if she decompensates may need TPA. A line in place if needs ABGs.
   -monitor for worsening tachypnea, o2 requirements

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and other comorbidities. She presents with shortness of breath and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/68 mmHg to 153/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving heparin drip and has been placed on CPAP at night.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles with expiratory wheezes, and she has stable edema with right-sided predominance. Her peripheral pulses are not assessed, and her neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, heart block, deep vein thrombosis, and diabetes mellitus type II. She has multiple medications including glargine, aspirin, niacin, omeprazole, and others.

The assessment and plan include worsening cough potentially secondary to pulmonary embolism burden or newly diagnosed pneumonia,"
