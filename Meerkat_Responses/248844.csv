   Assessment and Plan
   An 80 year old lady with DM, ESRD and history of subdural hematomas
   presents with new acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with
   altered mental status.  On admission she appears somnolent but oriented
   and able to defend her airway.
   1) Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to subdural hematomas given
   that she is corrected post-dialysis.  Her mental status appears to be
   diminished this AM in comparison to the prior night.  Etiology of
   bleeds remains unclear.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgical reccomendations
   - Repeat Head CT STAT this AM
   - q1 hour neuro checks
   - Control BP with labetalol IV & PO
   - Dilantin load complete- 100mg PO TID starting in AM with levels
   daily.
   - Hold ASA, anticoagulation
   2) Fever: The patient has a low grade fever today.  Possible sources
   include a line infection in her recently clotted dialysis catheter,
   central fever from subdural hematoma
   3) ESRD: Continue dialysis scheduled as above
   - Renal consult
   4) Hyperkalemia: Likely from her renal failure and limited dialysis the
   week prior.  Also per her sister there was some possible dietary
   indiscretion in prepartion for her scheduled line replacement today.
   Currently 5.8 down from 6.7 in ED.
   - Hemodialysis today in ICU
   - Renal following
   - Replete lytes prn
   - EKG on arrival to unit
   - Continue Sevelamer & Cincalcet
   Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Hold Starlix
   - Lantus + RISS
   5) Toxic multinodular goiter: Continue Methimazole 15mg home dose
   6) Hyperlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of subdural hematomas. She presents with new acute/subacute hematomas, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status. She has been somnolent but oriented and able to defend her airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to subdural hematomas given that she is corrected post-dialysis. Her mental status appears to be diminished this morning compared to the previous night. Etiology of bleeds remains unclear.
2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever today. Possible sources include a line infection in her recently clotted dialysis catheter, central fever from subdural hematoma.
3. ESRD: Continue dialysis scheduled as above - Renal consult.
4. Hyperkalemia: Likely from her renal failure and limited dialysis the week prior. Also, per her sister, there was some possible dietary indiscretion in preparation for her scheduled line replacement today. Currently 5.8 down from 6.7 in ED.
5. Toxic multinodular goiter: Continue Methimazole 15mg home dose.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare"

   An 80 year old lady with DM, ESRD and history of subdural hematomas
   presents with new acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with
   altered mental status.  On admission she appears somnolent but oriented
   and able to defend her airway.
   1) Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to subdural hematomas given
   that she is corrected post-dialysis.  Her mental status appears to be
   diminished this AM in comparison to the prior night.  Etiology of
   bleeds remains unclear.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgical reccomendations
   - Repeat Head CT STAT this AM
   - q1 hour neuro checks
   - Control BP with labetalol IV & PO
   - Dilantin load complete- 100mg PO TID starting in AM with levels
   daily.
   - Hold ASA, anticoagulation
   2) Fever: The patient has a low grade fever today.  Possible sources
   include a line infection in her recently clotted dialysis catheter,
   central fever from subdural hematoma, untreated thyrotoxicosis given
   held methimazole, and pneumonia from poorly cleared secretions.
   - Contact Renal re: line removal/replacement & accessing the line for
   blood cultures
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Restart Methimazole
   - CXR in AM
   3) ESRD: Continue dialysis scheduled as above
   - Renal consult
   4) Hyperkalemia: Likely from her renal failure and limited dialysis the
   week prior.  Also per her sister there was some possible dietary
   indiscretion in prepartion for her scheduled line replacement today.
   Currently 5.8 down from 6.7 in ED.
   - Hemodialysis today in ICU
   - Renal following
   - Replete lytes prn
   - EKG on arrival to unit
   - Continue Sevelamer & Cincalcet
   Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Hold Starlix

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old lady with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of subdural hematomas. She presents with new acute/subacute hematomas, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status. The patient appears somnolent but oriented and able to defend her airway. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely secondary to subdural hematomas. It is unclear what caused the bleeds, but the patient's mental status has diminished since the previous night. A repeat head CT scan is recommended, along with neuro checks every hour, controlling blood pressure with labetalol IV & PO, and monitoring Dilantin levels daily.
2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could be due to a line infection in her recently clotted dialysis catheter, central fever from subdural hematoma, untreated thyrotoxicosis given held methimazole, or pneumonia from poorly cleared secretions. Renal consultation is needed regarding line removal/replacement and blood cultures, as well as restarting methimazole and obtaining a chest X-ray in the morning.
3. ESRD: The patient's scheduled dialysis should continue, and a renal consult is required. Hemodialysis will be done today in the ICU.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels are likely due"

She presented with new acute/subacute hematomas, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status. On admission, she appeared somnolent but oriented and able to defend her airway. The patient has been receiving dialysis and her mental status has fluctuated, with some improvement after dialysis but deterioration overnight. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals acute on subacute or chronic subdural hematomas that have changed in configuration but overall size remains stable. A chest X-ray also shows new left lower lobe consolidation. The patient's fever is likely due to a line infection in the recently clotted dialysis catheter, central fever from subdural hematoma, untreated thyrotoxicosis, or pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and allergies to lisinopril, verapamil, and beta-adrenergic agents. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications, including infusions and other ICU medications. 

On review of systems, the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/47 mmHg to 161/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 74 kg. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative total input/output of 2950 mL, indicating significant fluid loss. Respiratory support is not required, with an oxygen delivery device and SpO2 level of 97%. 

Physical examination findings include an undetermined pulse in both radial and distal pulses, as well as an unassessed skin examination. Neurologic assessment is also incomplete. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 30.4%, platelets (Plt) at 186 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 4.3 mg/dL, and glucose at 188 mg/dL. Other lab values include prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an INR of 1.2. Imaging reveals unchanged subdural hematomas in configuration, with no new sites identified. Microbiology results for blood culture (BCx) are pending.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of subdural hematoma and end-stage renal disease. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a code status of full code and no disposition information is provided.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening of subdural hematoma, exacerbation of renal failure, fluid imbalance leading to electrolyte disturbances, and infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection. Close monitoring and prompt management of these complications are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of subdural hematomas and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has had several events over the past 24 hours, including the placement of a tunneled line and the start of dialysis catheter. She also developed a fever with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's sister reported that the patient becomes nervous when alone and does not talk, but she was able to have a lucid conversation with her sister. The head CT showed no change in the subdural hematomas. The patient has allergies to Lisinopril, Verapamil, and beta-adrenergic agents. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/62 mmHg to 148/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 74 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 530 mL and output of 50 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 480 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and her ABG results are not provided. Physical examination findings are limited due to assessment not being performed in several areas."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 80 year old lady with DM, ESRD and history of subdural hematomas
   presents with new acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with
   altered mental status.  On admission she appears somnolent but oriented
   and able to defend her airway.
   1) Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to subdural hematomas given
   that she is corrected post-dialysis.  Her mental status appears to be
   diminished this AM in comparison to the prior night.  Etiology of
   bleeds remains unclear.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgical reccomendations
   - Repeat Head CT STAT this AM
   - q1 hour neuro checks
   - Control BP with labetalol IV & PO
   - Dilantin load complete- 100mg PO TID starting in AM with levels
   daily.
   - Hold ASA, anticoagulation
   2) Fever: The patient has a low grade fever today.  Possible sources
   include a line infection in her recently clotted dialysis catheter,
   central fever from subdural hematoma, untreated thyrotoxicosis given
   held methimazole, and pneumonia from poorly cleared secretions.
   - Contact Renal re: line removal/replacement & accessing the line for
   blood cultures
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Restart Methimazole
   - CXR in AM
   3) ESRD: Continue dialysis scheduled as above
   - Renal following
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Continue Sevelamer & Cincalcet
   - Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday HD
   4) Hyperkalemia: Resolved after dialysis.  Will monitor.
   5) Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Hold Starlix
   - Lantus + RISS
   6) Toxic multinodular goiter: Continue Methimazole 15mg home dose
   6) Hyperlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin
   # Access:  Will discuss with renal
   # FEN: replete 'lytes prn
   # PPX: Teds/SCD, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous subdural hematomas. She presents with new acute/subacute hematomas, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 132/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is somnolent but oriented and able to defend her airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: This could be secondary to subdural hematomas or other factors such as infection, electroly imbalances, or medication side effects. Immediate steps include repeat head CT, monitoring neurologic status, controlling blood pressure, and initiating antiepileptic prophylaxis.
2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be due to line infection, central fever from subdural hematoma, untreated thyrotoxicosis, or pneumonia. Further investigation includes obtaining cultures from the dialysis catheter, performing a chest X-ray, and treating with Tylenol as needed.
3. ESRD: The patient requires continued dialysis management.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels have resolved after dialysis, but monitoring is necessary.
5. Diabetes Mellitus"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 80 year old lady with DM, ESRD and history of subdural hematomas
   presents with new acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with
   altered mental status.
   1) Altered mental status:  Likely chronic subdural hematomas and
   bacteremia contributing however patient
s sister believes she is close
   to her baseline today without intervention.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgical recommendations of no acute intervention
   - q4h neuro checks as pt is stable
   - Control BP with labetalol IV & PO
   - Dilantin load complete, continue 100mg PO TID.
   - Hold ASA, anticoagulation
   2) Fever/Positive blood culture:  The patient was febrile up to 101.3
   overnight and has GPC in pairs and clusters on blood cultures.
   Possible source of infection is recently clotted dialysis line.
   -  Likely line will have to be replaced, will discuss with renal today
   about placing temporary line
   - Will start empiric therapy with vancomycin per HD protocol
   - follow specificities and sensitivities
   .
   3) ESRD: Continue dialysis as scheduled on T, Th, and Sat
   - Renal following
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Continue Sevelamer & Cincalcet
   .
   4) Hyperkalemia: Resolved after dialysis, continues to be stable
   today.  Will monitor daily.
   .
   5) Diabetes Mellitus:
   - Continue to hold Starlix
   - Lantus + RISS
   6) Toxic multinodular goiter: Continue Methimazole 15mg home dose
   6) Hyperlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin
   # Access:  PIVs only now that pt has positive BCx

","Summary:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of subdural hematomas.
- She presents with new acute/subacute hematomas, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status.
- The patient's fever has resolved, and she has been diagnosed with bacteremia, likely due to a recently clotted dialysis line.
- The patient's current medications include dilantin, labetalol IV and PO, sevelamer, cincalcet, Lantus, RISS, methimazole, and atorvastatin.
- She is scheduled for dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 132/62 to 148/82 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: This could be due to chronic subdural hematomas, bacteremia, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and neurochecks are recommended.
2. Fever and positive blood culture: The patient had a fever overnight and has Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on blood cultures. This suggests a possible infection in the recently clotted dialysis line."
