","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male who presented with shortness of breath and weakness. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia. Temporary pacemaker wires were inserted, but attempts to place a temporary pacer lead failed, leading to the insertion of a Cordis/introducer. The patient became agitated and was given 5mg of Zyprexa. He pulled out his IV line, and a repeat chest X-ray was done. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 36 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 127/68 mmHg to 169/117 mmHg. The patient is on several medications, including furosemide, and has a history of renal failure, hypertension, elevated blood sugar, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient's current condition is being managed in the ICU with appropriate prophylactic measures in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's severe bradycardia and atrial fibrillation, there is a potential risk of further cardiac complications such as complete heart block or worsening of atrial fibrillation.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has crackles at the bases bilaterally, which could indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs. This may lead to respiratory distress or pneumonia if not properly managed.
3. Renal complications: The patient has a history"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male who presented with two weeks of shortness of breath and weakness. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia. Temporary pacemaker wires were inserted, but the initial attempt to place the temporary wire was unsuccessful. A Cordis/introducer was started, and the patient became agitated, receiving 5mg of Zyprexa. The patient pulled out his line, and a repeat chest X-ray was done. The patient's medical history, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications were documented.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate ranging from 31-49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/44mmHg to 127/68mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 11-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient has a junctional escape rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 289mL and output of 130mL, resulting in a balance of -159mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with a SpO2 of 96% and is not currently on respiratory support. The patient's physical examination is generally unremarkable, with the exception of few crackles at the bases bilaterally and trace lower extremity"

","The patient is a 211-year-old male presenting with shortness of breath and weakness for two weeks. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia and subsequently placed on a pacer. The patient experienced high filling pressures during the pacer placement procedure, resulting in a blood loss of approximately 500cc and received 600cc crystalloid. The patient's hematocrit level decreased from 36 to 31. Cordis was removed, and an echo was ordered but not done yet. The patient's blood pressure increased to 170s systolic, so captopril 6.25 mg TID was initiated. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/68 to 174/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced, and his general appearance is well appearing with a short neck and flat veins. Physical examination findings include crackles at the bases bilaterally, trace lower extremity edema, and no other significant abnormalities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and blood glucose levels. Other labs are within normal limits. 

The patient's assessment includes severe bradyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-appearing adult male in the ICU with a chief complaint of bradycardia. The patient has been placed on a pacer and experienced high filling pressures during the procedure. There was also a loss of about 500cc blood, resulting in a Hct of 31 (from 36), which was rechecked at 9pm and found to be 34.7. A Cordis was removed, and an Echo was ordered but not done yet. The patient's blood pressure increased to 170s systolic, and captopril was started at 6.25 TID.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's low heart rate (66 bpm) indicates bradycardia, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced organ perfusion.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient has lost approximately 500cc of blood, resulting in a decreased hematocrit level from 36% to 31%. This could indicate hypovolemia, potentially leading to reduced tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient received a significant amount of crystalloid (600cc), which may contribute to fluid overload and subsequent AKI. The imbalance in fluid intake and output further raises concerns for renal function.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 166/68 mmHg, indicating hypertension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of bradycardia.
- He presented with shortness of breath and weakness, and was found to have atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia.
- The patient's rhythm is currently AF with a junctional escape rhythm.
- He has evidence of mild to moderate volume overload, possibly secondary to his bradycardia.
- His respiratory status is stable for now.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- He is currently being treated in the ICU with various interventions, including the placement of a pacer and management of his renal function.
- The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medication may be considered if it remains high.
- He is also being treated for delirium, with reorientation and redirection as needed.
- His electrolyte levels and complete blood count are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's severe bradycardia could lead to inadequate cardiac output and subsequent organ hypoperfusion.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF can result in irregular heart rhythm, which may contribute to reduced cardiac output and increase the risk of thrombo"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old male who presented with shortness of breath and weakness. He was found to have atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia. A pacer was placed, but he experienced high filling pressures during the procedure and lost approximately 500cc of blood, receiving 600cc of crystalloid. His hematocrit (Hct) was initially 36%, but decreased to 31% and then increased to 34.7% and 31.3% on subsequent checks. His blood pressure has been elevated, reaching the 170s systolic, and he was started on captopril 6.25 TID. The patient also has mild crackles on lung examination and trace lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine, blood glucose, and lactic acid levels. An echocardiogram has been ordered, and the patient will be started on anticoagulation with warfarin. The patient continues to be agitated and confused, receiving Haldol for agitation. He has a history of hypertension, renal failure, elevated blood sugar, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension due to excessive fluid administration or ongoing blood loss.
2. Worsening renal function indicated by increased creatinine levels.
3. Delirium or agitation, which may require adjustment of medications or further"

","The patient is a 211-year-old male presenting with shortness of breath and weakness, found to be in atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia. He had a pacemaker placed yesterday, and his heart rate is now between 60-80 beats per minute. The patient also experienced some bleeding during the procedure, resulting in a loss of approximately 500cc of blood and received 600cc of crystalloid. His hematocrit (Hct) level was initially 36, then rechecked at 34.7, indicating some degree of blood loss but has partially recovered.

The patient's vital signs show an increased blood pressure in the 170s systolic range overnight, so captopril was initiated at a dose of 6.25 mg three times a day. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of -566 mL since 12 AM. The respiratory support indicates an oxygen delivery device via nasal cannula, and the patient's SpO2 is 95%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.26, which is slightly acidic.

The physical examination reveals a well-appearing adult male with no abnormalities in the head, neck, or chest area. The cardiac examination shows a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. There are no murmurs, gallops, or lifts noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 211-year-old male presenting with shortness of breath, weakness, and severe bradycardia. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker has been placed. The patient also has mild crackles on lung examination and a negative fluid balance of -500 mL. His blood pressure is elevated, for which he has been started on captopril. The patient continues to be agitated and confused, receiving Haldol for agitation. He has a history of renal failure, elevated blood sugar, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles on lung examination suggests possible pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: Despite being hypertensive, there is a risk of hypotension due to the ongoing fluid management and diuretic therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level and ongoing negative fluid balance put him at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: Immobility and risk factors increase the likelihood of thromboembolic events.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The patient is receiving respiratory support, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Delirium: The patient's ongoing agitation and confusion"
