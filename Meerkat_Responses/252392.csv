","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, cancer of the small bowel, and chronic pain. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, hypovolemia, and altered nutrition. The patient is currently on multiple medications including plasma expanders, antibiotics, and infliximab. He has been receiving IV fluids, arterial and venous access, and invasive ventilation. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a fever of 102.3Â°F, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered vital signs may indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's abnormal kidney function indicated by the elevated creatinine level may progress to acute kidney injury, which can be caused by inadequate oxygen delivery, medication toxicity, or sepsis.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and dependence on invasive ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications such as barotrauma or bronchospasm.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Acute Hypoxemic Resp failure: Etiology likely multifactorial:
   Sedation vs Aspiration. CTA negative for PE, although small pleural
   effusuions.
   - continue ventilator support
   - monitor ABG
   - head, chest, abd CT once more stable
   - stat bed-side abdominal u/s to look for bleed
   - f/u CEs
   - blood, sputum, urine culture
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive after intubation on propofol although
   could have been intravascular hypovolemia given aggressive diuresis on
   the floor. Responsive partially to IVF. Concern for early sepsis,
   cultures NGTD, started vanco/zosyn empirically.
   - NS bolus and pRBC infusion; pressor as needed to keep MAP > 60
   - place arterial line
   - empiric pip-tazo and vanco
   - pan culture

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged man with bilateral below-knee amputations, currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He has a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and chronic TPN dependence.

The patient's recent events include the following:
- Spontaneous development of fever at 102.3Â°F.
- Invasive ventilation started due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- Placement of a tunneled (Hickman) line and arterial line.
- Blood cultures were drawn from different sites, including the arterial line, and urine culture was also obtained.
- An ultrasound was performed, which showed no focal fluid collection or hematoma.
- Pan CT was ordered to evaluate for any potential sources of bleeding.
- The patient required multiple boluses for hypotension, which responded partially to IV fluids. This raised concerns for early sepsis, and empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam was started.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 18%, which improved to 23% after transfusion.
- Thrombocytopenia was noted with a platelet count of 57,000/mmÂ³.
- Heparin antibody test was negative.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3Â°C (100"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  No longer hypotensive following aggressive
   volume resusitation and transfusion of pRBCs.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  Now component of volume
   overload from aggressive volume replacement over past 24 hours.  To
   receive blood transfusion, may be able to try to diurese with blood.
   Will need to mobilize fluid to move towards weaning from mechanical
   ventilation.  Will monitor for increased secretions albeit do not feel
   he has PNA at this time.  Changes on CT likely compression atelectasis
   from increased pleural effusions.
 CHRONIC PAIN: Receiving prn boluses of fentanyl for agitation or
   pain.  Appears comfortable.
 CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS): With associated short gut
   syndrome on TPN.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: TPN, insulin in TPN to control sugars.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GASTRIC: Wound appeared to be healing
   well when viewed with surgery/plastics this morning.  Loop of bowel
   herniating through. Plan as per surgery.  Holding lovenox per surgery
   for anticipated procedure.  GNR growing from bile.  Continues broad
   spectrum antibiotics for possible sepsis - vanco/zosyn.  Consider
   discontinue vanco if no other positive blood culture results in next 24
   hours.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Plts stable.  Heme onc service feels this is
   likely autoimmune mediated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, short gut syndrome, and gastric carcinoma.
- He was admitted to the ICU intubated for acute respiratory failure and hypotension.
- The patient underwent multiple procedures and interventions, including invasive ventilation, placement of a tunneled (Hickman) line, arterial line, and blood cultures.
- He received transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for possible sepsis.
- The patient's vital signs were monitored, and he required aggressive volume resuscitation.
- His respiratory support included CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with FiO2 set at 50%.
- Laboratory results showed leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggests a possible infection leading to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, but ongoing monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although ARDS is not confirmed based on the CT scan findings, the patient's acute respiratory failure and volume overload may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recently diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient underwent a tumor resection yesterday and was found unresponsive with acute hypoxia on the floor. He was intubated and given IV fluids. Cultures were obtained from blood, sputum, and urine. The patient was started on antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) due to suspected early sepsis. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells for anemia and diuresis. The patient's condition is complex, involving respiratory failure, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, Crohn's disease, alteration in nutrition, and cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating acute respiratory failure. Monitoring ABG and considering extubation plans should be considered.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after intubation and responded to IV fluids. There is concern for early sepsis, so monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and continuing empirical antibiotic therapy is important.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to surgery or immobility. Regular wound assessment and preventive measures"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recently diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient underwent a tumor resection and was found unresponsive with acute hypoxia on the floor. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1Â°F (38.4Â°C), blood pressure ranging from 131/61 mmHg to 95/37 mmHg, heart rate between 92 and 74 bpm, respiratory rate between 16 and 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated due to suspected early sepsis.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic pain, peripheral edema, and hypoalbuminemia. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and chronic pain. The patient is critically ill with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and potential sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 9.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57, and elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal"

   Blood cultures negative to date.  Will continue for now.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  Now limited from coming
   off the ventilator due to volume overload and bilateral pleural
   effusions.  Responding well to lasix. Has been PSV 5/PEEP 5/40% FiO2.
   RISB 43.  Anticipate extubation later today once we get him negative.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:  Wound clean and dry. Surgery following.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient has a history of gastric cancer that required resection. Currently, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to volume overload and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and they are responding well to lasix, which is a diuretic used to reduce fluid buildup. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and surgery will be performed to address this issue. The patient also has chronic pain controlled with fentanyl boluses and is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to short gut syndrome resulting from Crohn's disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: Since the patient is still on empiric antibiotics for the possibility of sepsis, it suggests that there may still be an ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis such as fever, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and low blood pressure is crucial.

2. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure has limited their ability to come off the ventilator. Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung injury.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of fluids, which could lead to fluid overload. This can result in congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

   55yoM with Crohn's c/b multiple abdominal surgeries, recently dx with
   mucinous adenoca s/p tumor and small bowel resection that was found
   yesterday on the floor  with acute hypoxia and unresponsiveness.
   # Acute Hypoxemic Resp Failure: Etiology likely multifactorial: Pt now
   alert. Etiologies sedation vs aspiration vs early sepsis. CTA negative
   for PE, although small pleural effusuions.  RISB 41 this AM. Last ABG
   7.41/31/170.
   - Diurese -1L today
   - monitor ABG
   - blood, sputum, urine culture
   - Consider extubation. Will notify surgery prior to any plans for
   extubation.
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive after intubation on propofol.
   Responsive  to IVF. Concern for early sepsis given GNRs on drainage
   gram stain, cultures NGTD, started vanco/zosyn.  JP culture with3+
   GNR.  TTE w/o vegetations. Now fluid overloaded and diuresing.
   - Keeping MAPs > 60
   - empiric pip-tazo and vanco
   - f/u cultures
   - IV Hydrocort
   - Will check JP drain for amylase, peritoneal cell count
   - F/u any further surgical recs
   # Anemia:  Received 2 pRBCs for a HCt of 23, appropriate bump to 30.
   Abdominal CT negative for blood/fluid collection.
   - Serial Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 52. HIT negative.
   -          Cont to monitor serially
   #  Crohns, Short-Gut:  Continue TPN, insulin in TPN to maintain good
   sugar control. Can use RISS as well. Albumin ~2.9.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who recently underwent surgery for a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient was found unresponsive with acute hypoxia and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to multiple factors such as sedation, aspiration, or early sepsis. Continuous monitoring of the patient's ABG and consideration for extubation should be done.

2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive after intubation on propofol, which may indicate early sepsis. The patient is responsive to IV fluids and has been started on empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and MAPs, as well as follow-up cultures, is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient received two units of packed red blood cells to increase the hematocrit from 23% to 30%. Serial Hct monitoring should be done, and further surgical recommendations should be considered based on the patient's condition.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 52, which could be due to sepsis or other causes. Continuous monitoring of platelet levels and serial testing is advised.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, gastric cancer s/p resection, and amputee of both lower extremities. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient had been intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday afternoon. He remains hemodynamically stable on maintenance fluids as he is still NPO. His cultures remain negative. The patient's pain is controlled with minimal morphine overnight. He received Lasix for a positive fluid balance and has been diuresing. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 113/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and standby ventilator mode with a tidal volume of 0 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 9.3 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 62 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 78 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02 ng/mL.

The patient has impaired skin integrity with a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer. He also has chronic pain requiring minimal morphine overnight. He has resolved hypovolemia but is now experiencing fluid overload, which is being managed with diuretics. 

The patient's electrolytes show low potassium levels in the setting of aggressive diuresis. His nutritional status is compromised due to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and altered glycemic control requiring regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines including a tunneled (Hickman) line and arterial line. Prophylactic measures include low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and sucralfate for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he is planned to be transferred to the floor once stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease and multiple abdominal surgeries, who was recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and underwent tumor resection. The patient presents with acute hypoxia and unresponsiveness, found with a large abdominal wound vac draining 450 cc of bilious fluid. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring after surgery to change the wound vac. The patient was extubated more than 24 hours ago and is experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a negative fluid balance. The patient's hypotension has been stable overnight, and diuresis is ongoing. The patient has anemia with a Hct of 28, thrombocytopenia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is also experiencing peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the small bowel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function should be closely monitored, and oxygen saturation levels should be maintained above 96%.
2. Hypotension: Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure mean arterial pressure (MAP) remains above 60 mmHg. Diuretics may be used to manage fluid balance and maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: Regular assessment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, following multiple abdominal surgeries. The patient had a tumor resection and was found unresponsive with acute hypoxia on the floor. He has a large abdominal wound that is draining bilious fluid and requires a wound vacuum change. The patient is currently in the ICU and will need sedation post-procedure. He was previously intubated but is now extubated and experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. His respiratory status will be closely monitored, and sputum cultures have been obtained. The patient also has hypotension, which is being managed with diuretics to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Blood cultures have been taken, and antibiotics have been continued. The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 28 and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 56. Serial complete blood counts (CBCs) will be monitored. The patient has Crohn's disease and short-gut syndrome, for which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will continue, including insulin to maintain good blood sugar control. Hydrocortisone 75mg IV every 24 hours will also be continued. The patient has impaired skin integrity with a wound that requires regular monitoring and wound care from the wound team.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and gastric cancer who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently stable, with no respiratory complaints. The patient has been adequately controlled on pain medication and is experiencing minimal white phlegm cough. Diuresis of approximately 2 liters negative has been administered overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 126/65 to 103/48 mmHg. The patient is alert and oriented, with no neurological deficits. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, and a stool culture is pending. There is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Additionally, the patient has an indwelling line, which increases the risk of line-associated infections.

2. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and an elevated INR (international normalized ratio), indicating a potential risk for bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, with a total input of 3,429 mL and output of 5,699 mL over the past 24 hours. This"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of Crohn's disease and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and underwent tumor resection. The patient presented yesterday on the floor with acute hypoxia and unresponsiveness. 

Current conditions and treatments:
1. Abdominal wound: The patient has a large abdominal wound that is being managed with a wound vacuum (wound vac). The wound is draining approximately 450 cc of bilious fluid. Surgery is planned to change the wound vac today, and the patient will be monitored in the ICU afterward due to the need for sedation.
2. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was extubated more than 24 hours ago and experienced negative fluid balance of 2.3 liters yesterday. Sputum cultures showed growth of gram-negative rods (GNR) and opportunistic pathogens. Oxygen saturation will be monitored, and blood cultures will be followed up.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight. Close monitoring will continue while diuresis is ongoing. The patient is responding well to diuretics, and MAPs (mean arterial pressure) will be maintained above 60 mmHg. The patient is not experiencing Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) based on negative tests. Antibiotics (Pip-Tazo and Vancomycin) will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of Crohn's disease and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma, who underwent small bowel resection. The patient was found with acute hypoxia and unresponsiveness on the floor and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been extubated for more than 24 hours and had a negative fluid balance of -2.3L yesterday. There is a growth of GNR in the sputum culture. Monitoring O2 sats and following up with blood cultures is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable overnight, but close monitoring is required while diuresing. It is important to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Continuing with Pip-Tazo and Vanco, discussing the duration of antibiotic therapy with surgery, and following up with cultures is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is 28, and serial Hcts should be done.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and it is negative for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Serial monitoring of platelet levels is advised.
5. Crohn's Disease and Short-Gut Syndrome: Continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with insulin to maintain good"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recently diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma who underwent small bowel resection. The patient initially experienced hypoxemia and hypotension but has since resolved. However, the patient now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel. Surgery performed an enterotomy and placed a drainage bag, which was changed this morning.

The patient is currently being monitored in the ICU until further surgical recommendations are made. The patient's current medical issues include acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (extubated over 24 hours), hypotension, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and ongoing monitoring of oxygen saturation, fluid balance, and vital signs is being conducted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Surgical site infection: Given the patient's recent surgery and exposure of the small bowel, there is a risk of surgical site infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the wound, is necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was previously intubated. Although the patient has been extubated, ongoing monitoring of oxygen saturation is crucial to ensure adequate respiratory function. Complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration in respiratory status should be closely monitored.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent small bowel resection and now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel. The patient has been managed with drainage bag changes and ventral wall wound care. He will be monitored in the ICU until Monday and then transferred to the hospital ward for surgical drainage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's perforated bowel and exposed small bowel increase the risk of infection. Regular monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, should be done.
2. Bleeding: The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 29.1%. Serial hemoglobin checks should be done to monitor for worsening anemia or bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 75 K/uL. Monitoring the platelet count and considering transfusion if the platelet count drops further.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to short-gut syndrome. Monitoring the patient's nutritional status and adjusting TPN as needed.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is on hydrocortisone for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Monitoring cortisol levels and adjusting hydrocortisone dosage accordingly.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, and multiple abdominal surgeries. The patient underwent tumor resection and small bowel resection with resolved hypoxemia and hypotension. However, the patient now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,183 mL and output of 3,951 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 768 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,065 mL of IV fluids and 150 mL of oral intake.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 29.1%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 75,000/mmÂ³, and elevated lactate levels at 2.1 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's diagnosis includes hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, Crohn's disease, alteration in nutrition, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the small bowel.

The plan of care includes ongoing monitoring in the ICU until Monday, followed by transfer to a hospital ward for surgical drainage. The patient will continue total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin to maintain good glucose control. Serial Hcts and platelet monitoring will be conducted. The patient is also on hydrocortisone for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and has a stage II decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and exposed small bowel make him susceptible to infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated lactate levels indicate possible bleeding complications.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's negative fluid balance may lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or underlying lung issues.
5. Cancer recurrence or spread: Given the patient's history of cancer, there is a risk of recurrence or spread of the disease.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, laboratory values, and wound healing progress. Timely interventions and adjustments to the treatment plan should be implemented to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient underwent tumor resection and small bowel resection with subsequent drainage due to a perforated exposed small bowel. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring until Monday, when he will be transferred to a hospital ward for surgical drainage.

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia (without shock), Crohn's disease, alteration in nutrition, and small bowel cancer.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F)
- Heart rate: 98 bpm (79-98)
- Blood pressure: 123/66 mmHg (86/68-147/93)
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (11-27)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 9.7-10.4 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 28.4-29.8%
- Platelet count: 43-102 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.7-0.9 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 81-141 mg/dL
- Other lab values within normal range

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 768 mL over the past 24 hours.

The assessment and plan include hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, Crohn's disease, alteration in nutrition, and small bowel cancer. The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, insulin in TPN, and hydrocortisone for glycemic control, wound care, and medication management. The patient's condition will be closely monitored in the ICU until Monday, when he will be transferred to a hospital ward for further care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who underwent small bowel resection due to mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient experienced hypoxemia and hypotension post-surgery, which have since resolved. However, the patient developed a perforated exposed small bowel and underwent surgical placement of a drainage bag. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring until Monday, when he will be transferred to a hospital ward for further surgical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a large anterior dressing with serous/brownish drainage, indicating a potential wound infection or compromised healing process.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, indicating a risk of inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's oxygen saturation is currently stable, there is a risk of respiratory complications due to the recent surgery and potential lung issues related to the underlying condition.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating an increased risk of bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient has a slightly low hematocrit level, suggesting a potential need for blood transfusion or further investigation into the cause of anemia.
6. Infection: The presence of drainage from the wound increases the risk of infection, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent or manage any potential infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with Crohn's disease who has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries. He was recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma and underwent tumor resection and small bowel resection. The patient now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. The patient's medical history includes anemia, thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease, short-gut syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and skin integrity issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a large abdominal wound with significant drainage, which increases the risk of infection. There is also a sputum culture indicating Klebsiella pneumoniae, which requires appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Abscess or fistula formation: The exposed small bowel and ongoing drainage raise concerns about the development of an abscess or fistula.
3. Malnutrition: Due to short-gut syndrome, the patient may have impaired nutrient absorption, leading to malnutrition.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has thrombocytopenia and is receiving low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Close monitoring is necessary to prevent thrombotic events.
5. Adhesions and bowel obstruction: Previous surgeries can lead to adhesion formation, which may cause bowel obstruction in the future.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed through appropriate management and monitoring."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, and underwent small bowel resection. He now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as respiratory failure or infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential inadequate perfusion and organ function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is not functioning properly, leading to insufficient oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has stage II decubitus ulcers, which can be a result of prolonged immobility and poor nutrition.
5. Peripheral Edema: The patient has swelling in the extremities, which may be due to fluid overload or venous insufficiency.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient is experiencing ongoing pain, likely due to multiple surgeries and underlying conditions.
7. Hypovolemia: The patient has volume depletion without shock, indicating inadequate fluid balance.
8. Crohn's Disease: The patient has a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that may contribute to his current complications.
9. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, as"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who has recently undergone tumor resection and small bowel resection. He presents with multiple complications including hypoxemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the small bowel.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/73 to 92/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's overall fluid balance shows an intake of 5,280 mL and output of 4,390 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and decreased platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal progression of splenic infarcts and a possible fluid collection in the abdomen, which will be further evaluated.

The patient has multiple ongoing medical issues including anemia, thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease, short-gut syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and impaired skin integrity. He is receiving various medications including TPN, insulin, Flagyl, Zosyn, and corticosteroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and gastric cancer who is currently in the ICU for postoperative care after undergoing surgery for bile lead and bowel tear. The patient has multiple medical complications and is on various medications including TPN (total parenteral nutrition), antibiotics, and pain management.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure but is currently stable without new respiratory complaints. However, the presence of Klebsiella in the sputum may indicate a potential infection that needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has wounds that require regular wound care and dressing changes due to impaired skin integrity. Proper wound management is essential to prevent infection and promote healing.

3. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain is well-controlled on current medications. However, any changes in pain management or medication should be closely monitored for potential complications.

4. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is an inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Flares of Crohn's disease may occur during the recovery period and require adjustment of medications.

5. Short gut syndrome: The patient also has short gut syndrome, a condition that occurs when a significant portion of the small intestine has been removed, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. TPN is being administered to provide adequate nutrition, but monitoring for complications related to malabsorption and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.

6. Gastric cancer: The patient has a history of gastric cancer, and postoperative complications related to the surgical procedure should be closely monitored. Follow-up imaging and procedures may be required to assess for any signs of recurrence or complications.

7. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential abdominal infectious sources. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or worsening of vital signs, is crucial.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring for various potential complications related to respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic pain, Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, gastric cancer, and infection."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, multiple abdominal surgeries, recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma status post tumor and small bowel resection, now presenting with perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. The patient has undergone gastric tumor resection and is experiencing postoperative complications such as bile leak and bowel tear. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent 37Â°C, HR: 87 bpm, BP: 128/71 mmHg, RR: 20 breaths/min, SpO2: 94%
- Fluid balance: Total in 9,912 mL, Total out 3,875 mL, Net 6,037 mL
- Respiratory support: O2 delivery device - Medium conc mask, SpO2: 94%
- Laboratory results:
   - WBC: 8.2-6.9 K/uL
   - Hct: 29.1-27.1%
   - Plt: 75-136 K/uL
   - Cr: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
   - Glucose: 95-132 mg/dL
   - Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.9/69.3/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 26/2/0.02, ALT/AST: 23/20, Alk Phos/T Bili: 224/0.8, Amylase/Lipase: 66/, Differential-Neuts: 73.5%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 18.8%, Mono: 6.1%, Eos: 0.6%, Fibrinogen: 344 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.1 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.2 g/dL, LDH: 268 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 4.2 mg/dL

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of a bowel tear, previous surgeries, and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has an ongoing fluid loss, which needs to be managed carefully to maintain fluid balance.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the potential for pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
6. Thromboembolic events: Despite receiving LMW heparin, the patient's antiphospholipid antibodies increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
7. Medication reactions: Given the patient's known allergies, there is a risk of medication reactions.
8. Wound healing complications: The patient's wound healing may be impaired due to factors like steroids and the presence of a bowel tear.
9. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver and kidney functions need to be closely monitored as indicated by the abnormal laboratory results.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, laboratory results, and any signs of infection or bleeding. The patient"

","The patient is a 27-year-old Caucasian female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, small bowel cancer, and peripheral neuropathy. She presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and was subsequently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Upon admission, the patient was started on multiple medications including antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole), anti-inflammatory drugs (Remicade), and pain management medications (Valium, Morphine). She also received plasma expanders and IV fluids to maintain fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. However, the patient was placed on respiratory support with a medium concentration mask due to respiratory failure.

Laboratory results showed leukopenia with a WBC count of 5.9 K/uL and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. The patient's platelet count was within normal limits at 151 K/uL. Renal function tests revealed elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney impairment. Liver function tests were within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance showed a positive net fluid intake of 6,037 mL over 24 hours, with an output of 3,875 mL through various routes. Urine output was within"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who underwent surgery for gastric tumor resection. The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by bile leak and bowel tear, leading to the exposure of the small bowel and copious drainage. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being covered empirically for abdominal infectious sources with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. The patient's WBC count is normal. A HIDA scan on 10/26 confirmed a bile leak exiting the abdomen through a right upper quadrant drain. The patient will undergo a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) and drain replacement today. The patient's anemia is stable, and thrombocytopenia is improving. The patient's short-gut syndrome is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin to maintain good sugar control. The patient is also on home dose prednisone for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and hydrocortisone for stress. The patient's skin integrity is improving from a stage II decubitus ulcer. The patient has anxiety and is not sleeping well at night, so lorazepam is being used as needed, and a social work consult has been requested for coping strategies. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is still pending further evaluation and treatment."

   wound (pending official read)
   - Patient went for PTC yesterday, but no leak at the biliary jejunal
   anastamosis was found so no drain was placed.
   - d/c'd steriods as this likely impairs wound healing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibody, and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma status post tumor resection and small bowel resection. The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by a bile leak and bowel tear. The patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) yesterday without finding a bile leak, so no drain was placed. The patient advanced to clear liquids overnight and took in 1500cc, with subsequent green output of 1600ccs. The patient's fluids are being replaced at a 1.5:1 ratio with normal saline and 50 meq/L potassium chloride. The patient remains afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and has a normal white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a drain and the fact that he is immunocompromised due to Crohn's disease and recent surgery.
2. Bleeding: Although the patient's platelet count is stable and there are no signs of bleeding, the use of anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, but it is being monitored serially.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the stomach following small bowel resection. The patient has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries and is currently presenting with a perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. 

The patient's recent postoperative course has been complicated by a bile leak and bowel tear, for which a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) was performed yesterday without evidence of bile leak, and no drain was placed. The patient has advanced to clear liquids overnight and took in 1500cc, with a subsequent green output of 1600cc. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7C (99.8F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on medium concentration mask. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13500/mm3, elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L, low platelet count of 102000/mm3, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, and a recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the stomach following a small bowel resection. The patient has experienced multiple abdominal surgeries and is currently presenting with a perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by a bile leak and bowel tear, but a procedure called percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) was performed yesterday without finding any bile leak, and no drain was placed. The patient has been advanced to clear liquids overnight and tolerated 1500cc, with a subsequent green output of 1600cc. Fluid losses are being replaced at a ratio of 1.5:1 normal saline with 10% potassium chloride. The patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and has a normal white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of a drain and the fact that he is immunocompromised. Antibiotic coverage should be continued to prevent or treat any potential infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent blood repletion may indicate ongoing blood loss or bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and continuing to check for signs of bleeding are important.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, chronic pain, and small bowel cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, peripheral edema, and volume depletion. The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metronidazole, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 56.9 kg at admission to 59.9 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 9,912 mL and output of 3,875 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 6,037 mL. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids at a rate of 90 mL/hour. Lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 102 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient underwent gastric tumor resection and small bowel resection due to a perforated exposed small bowel. The postoperative course has been complicated by a bile leak and bowel tear. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which increases the risk of thrombosis.
3. Malnutrition: Due to the patient's short-gut syndrome and impaired ability to absorb nutrients, there is a risk of malnutrition and subsequent weight loss.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance needs to be closely monitored and managed due to ongoing fluid losses and the use of intravenous fluids.
5. Wound infection: The patient's stage II decubitus ulcer increases the risk of wound infection.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be monitored closely due to the risk of acute respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was recently diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and underwent a tumor resection. Postoperatively, he experienced a bile leak and bowel tear, with an exposed small bowel and copious drainage. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to Crohn's disease and recent surgery increases the risk of infections. There is a suspicion of Clostridium Perfringens infection, and antibiotics have been prescribed.
2. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has ongoing fluid losses from diarrhea and drainage, which need to be replaced. Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent imbalances.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, but it is currently stable with no signs of bleeding. Serial monitoring of platelet levels will be necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 26.7%. Follow-up Hct will be needed to monitor for any changes in anemia.
5. Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage II decubitus ulcer, which is improving per nursing care. Wound care and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and recently diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient underwent small bowel resection and now presents with a perforated exposed small bowel and copious drainage. He also has a history of gastric tumor resection, postoperative course complicated by bile leak and bowel tear, with an ongoing drain in place. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is slightly below normal, indicating possible impaired oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower end of the normal range, which may indicate low blood volume or inadequate cardiac output.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to compromised lung function or fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed a stage II decubitus ulcer, indicating compromised skin integrity and potential pressure injuries.
5. Edema: The patient has peripheral edema, which can be caused by fluid overload or decreased venous return.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, possibly related to his underlying medical conditions or surgical procedures.
7. Hypovolemia: The patient is volume depleted without shock, indicating insufficient fluid volume in the circulatory system"

          Check venous pH to confirm acidosis; check lactate
          Suspect this is due to high chloride in replacement fluid
   (normal saline) compared with ostomy losses.  Will attempt to measure
   lytes in ostomy losses and change replacement fluids to match.  In
   interim, discuss with primary team about alternate replacement fluids.
          Will adjust acetate-chloride balance in TPN as well over the

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, and recent diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, who underwent small bowel resection. He is currently in the ICU due to postoperative complications including bile leak and bowel tear. The patient is on clears and is replacing fluid losses with 1:1 NS without KCl. He is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and has a normal white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, which is below the normal range, indicating possible hypoxemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 114/60 mmHg, which is lower than the normal range, indicating possible hypotension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and ABG results show a pH of 7.45, indicating possible respiratory failure.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has stage II decubitus ulcers, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Peripheral edema: The patient has swelling in the extremities, indicating possible peripheral edema.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypovolemia: The patient is replacing fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and recent gastric tumor resection. The patient has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries and is currently experiencing a perforated exposed small bowel with copious drainage. The patient is in the ICU for postoperative care following small bowel resection due to mucinous adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity (stage II decubitus), peripheral edema, chronic pain, hypovolemia, Crohn's disease, alteration in nutrition, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the small bowel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure. It is important to monitor oxygenation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support if necessary.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage II decubitus ulcer, indicating impaired skin integrity. Regular wound care and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent further deterioration.
3. Peripheral Edema: The patient is exhibiting signs of peripheral edema. This could be due to fluid overload or hypoproteinemia. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to manage this condition effectively.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. Proper hemodynamic monitoring and prompt intervention to maintain adequate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently in the ICU and have been stable hemodynamically. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, entero-cutaneous fistula, and bile leak. They are also dealing with chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, cancer of the small bowel, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are generally within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/69 mmHg to 132/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving respiratory support, but it is not specified what type of support.

The patient has been receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) with lipids and has been tolerating oral feedings reasonably well. Their electrolytes are stable, and their white blood cell count is stable as well. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating but remain above the transfusion threshold.

The patient has several drainages from wounds, which contribute to a positive fluid balance. They also have peripheral edema and chronic pain due to their medical conditions. The patient has impaired skin integrity with a stage II decubitus ulcer.

The patient's lab results show normal kidney function, but elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid. Their liver enzymes and bilir"
