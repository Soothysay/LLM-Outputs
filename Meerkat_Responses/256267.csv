The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to sepsis, pancolitis, and respiratory lower lobe pneumonia (RLL).

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated lactate level, suggesting ongoing sepsis. The physical examination reveals bilateral fluid on chest X-ray and signs of respiratory distress. The laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated D-dimer levels.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, cisatracurium, drotrecogin, insulin, pantoprazole, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes chronic hepatitis C, type 1 DM, asthma, anemia, and a previous cryptosporidial infection. The patient is also coagulopathic with an increasing INR, indicating worsening synthetic liver function.

The potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi"

   last flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with
   worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Significant worsening overnight.  Has now received IVIG and
   xigris.  Difficulty ventilating and oxygenating overnight with
   worsening acidosis.  Finally improved with recruitment maneuvers.  BP
   improved at that point and he pressors have been weaned to two..
   Patient has pancolitis.   Stool studies in the past have been negative
   includign C diff negative x 2.  She also has RLL pneumonia with
   airbronchograms.  Unclear whether PNA is secondary to aspiration.
   - appreciate surgical input, called for consult
 surgery likely too
   risky
   - rivers protocol for sepsis
   - f/u cultures, currently NTD including at OSH.
   - cont broad spectrim antibiotics
   - ID recs
   - liver recs

   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.
   Stable.  Urine lytes prerenal.
   - adequate fluid resuscitation
   - follow UCx
   - will trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds

   # Chronic Hepatitis C: Recent paracentesis concerning for SBP, though
   aseptic on culture.   Very small amount of ascites, too small to tap at
   bedside and not likely enough for SBP.
   - liver recs
   - broad spectrum antibiotics  as above
   .
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now.
   - insulin drip for rising BG

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old lady with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and a distant history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has experienced a significant worsening overnight, leading to the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and drotrecogin (Xigris). Difficulty in ventilating and oxygenating overnight with worsening acidosis was observed but improved with recruitment maneuvers. Blood pressure improved at that point, and the need for pressors has been reduced to two.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia with air bronchograms. It is unclear whether the pneumonia is secondary to aspiration.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient has pancolitis, as mentioned earlier. The presence of guaiac-positive stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The etiology of ARF is unclear but may be related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis. The patient's urine electrolytes indicate prerenal azotemia.

5. Chronic Hepatitis C: Recent paracentesis was performed, which was concerning for spontaneous bacterial"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:
   Shock:  likely septic, most likely source is gut with colitis on CT.
   Other possibility includes lungs. Covering broadly- On Linezolid, oral
   Vanc, Meropenem, Flagyl. Will add Caspo given h/o DM and colitis.
   Not a surgical candidate, per surgery.
   All cxs, cdiff pending.
   Continue Xigris.
   Altered mental status: ? encephalopathy from Hep C cirrhosis. Start
   lactulose when GI status improved. Did not have LP to eval for CNS
   infection, but broadly covered with abx.
   Renal failure: Likely related to sepsis, stable Cr so far.
   Resp: Now with much worse resp status, evolved ARDS. Would like to try
   to wean settings to  ARDSnet protocol if continues to improve.
   Hep C cirrhosis and coagulopathy: Vit K, FFP for procedures
   DM I: started insulin gtt.
   Neuro: on Fent/Versed, currently paralyzed. Will try to wean paralytic
   later today if remains improved.
   Anemia: +guiac stools. watch for signs of bleeding on Xigris. Received
   blood transfusion for sepsis, follow Hct.
   ICU: VAP bundle, PPI, L IJ, 18 g IV.
   Family: discussed with them on rounds. (Fiancee is HCP).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing shock, most likely due to sepsis with a possible source in the gut or lungs. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential infections. Other potential complications include renal failure, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatic encephalopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, indicating the development of ARDS. The medical team is considering weaning the ventilator settings according to the ARDSnet protocol if the patient continues to improve.

The patient also has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and coagulopathy, for which Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are being administered for procedures. Insulin gtt has been started for the management of diabetes mellitus.

Anemia is suspected due to the presence of guaiac stools, and the patient has received a blood transfusion for sepsis. The hematocrit (Hct) levels will be monitored closely.

In the ICU, the patient is receiving VAP bundle prophylaxis, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and has an 18-gauge IV line in the left internal jugular vein (LIJ).

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of potential complications are essential."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type I, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cocaine abuse, acute renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, other colitis, severe sepsis, and pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient's condition remains unstable with persistent hypoxia and high plateau pressures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of vasopressors can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to sepsis and prolonged hospital stay can increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's current acute renal failure, combined with the use of nephrotoxic medications and decreased renal perfusion, can further worsen renal function.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's chronic viral hepatitis and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pancolitis, acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic hepatitis C, type 1 DM, asthma, anemia, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has significant worsening of sepsis, requiring IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Drotrecogin (Xigris). She still requires two pressors to maintain blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status improved with recruitment maneuvers but is still at risk for further deterioration.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has unclear etiology AKI, possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given sepsis. Adequate fluid resuscitation and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.
4. Chronic Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, which may contribute to her liver dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), chronic hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, pancolitis, right lower lobe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (ARF), chronic hepatitis C, type 1 DM, asthma, anemia, and is currently intubated. The patient is receiving IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), Drotrecogin (Xigris), and broad-spectrum antibiotics as part of the rivers protocol for sepsis. She also has a left internal jugular (IJ) central line, arterial line, and multiple peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has significant worsening overnight with difficulty ventilating and oxygenating, indicating a possible progression of sepsis. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters are crucial.
2. ARF: The patient's renal function appears to be stable, but the cause of ARF is unclear. It may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis. Adequate fluid resuscitation, avoiding nephrotoxins, and renal dosing of medications should be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   CV/ID: Shock- likely septic, most likely source is gut with colitis on
   CT. Other possibility includes lungs, CNS also not explored. Covering
   broadly- On Linezolid, oral Vanc, Meropenem, Flagyl. ID does not feel
   fungal coverage necessary.
   Not a surgical candidate, per surgery.
   All cxs, cdiff pending.
   Altered mental status: ? encephalopathy from Hep C cirrhosis. Start
   lactulose when GI status improved. Did not have LP to eval for CNS
   infection, but broadly covered with abx and over clinical status
   stabilized.
   Renal failure: Likely related to sepsis, stable Cr so far.
   Resp: Now with much worse resp status, evolved ARDS. Would like to try
   to wean settings to  ARDSnet protocol if continues to improve.
   Hep C cirrhosis and coagulopathy: Vit K, FFP for procedures
   DM I: started insulin gtt.
   Neuro: on Fent/Versed, currently paralyzed again, will try again to
   stop later today if resp status improves.
   Heme- Anemia: +guiac stools with coagulopathy. Watch closely  for signs
   of bleeding on Xigris. Received blood transfusion for sepsis, follow
   Hct. coags worse on Xigris..will d/w pharmacy re: holding infusion for

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have a history of multiple allergies and have been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected gut infection, although other sources such as the lungs or CNS have not been ruled out.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 to 154/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 82%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 11.3 L/min, and cardiac index (CI) is 6.7 L/min/m2.

The patient has received multiple infusions including vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, drotrecogin (Xigris), midazolam (Versed), and cisatracurium. They are also on vasopressor and inotropic support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 23.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 28.0%, platelet count (Plt) at 185 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) at 25 mmHg, glucose at 259 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab values indicate potential liver dysfunction and elevated levels of D-dimer.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals distention without bowel sounds (BS). Extremities show signs of edema, with both right and left being 3+. Neurologic assessment is unresponsive with no movement or tone.

Microbiology results are negative to date. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, oral vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole.

The patient's assessment includes shock, likely septic, with the gut as the most likely source. Other possibilities include the lungs and CNS, but these have not been fully explored. The patient is not a surgical candidate at this time.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These may include worsening sepsis leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatic failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and coagulopathy. The patient's altered mental status could be due to encephalopathy from Hep C cirrhosis or sepsis-related encephalopathy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and response to treatment. Frequent reassessment and prompt management of any complications will be crucial in optimizing the patient's outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and a past inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, pancolitis, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic hepatitis C, Type 1 DM, asthma, anemia, coagulopathy, and is currently intubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires two pressors. She has been receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Xigris, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has had a recent cryptosporidial infection. Surgical input has been sought for potential consult, as surgery may be risky. The patient's conditions include sepsis, respiratory distress, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, chronic hepatitis C, Type 1 DM, asthma, anemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently stable but still requires two pressors, indicating ongoing instability. There is a risk of further deterioration or development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has shown improvement with recruitment maneuvers but may still experience fluctuations in oxygenation and ventilation. Weaning off FiO2 and increasing PEEP"

   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improvement in ABG since Friday.  Weaned off 1 of 3
   pressors, though unable to wean further.   Has now received IVIG and
   xigris.  Xigris stopped on [**2-15**] secondary to elevated coags and risk of
   bleeding thought to outway benefit.  Now growing cdiff on OSH stool
   cuture.  Other scutlures are significant for VRE + swab, and UCx as
   well as mini BAL growing yeast.  Pulm status is complicated by an [**Month/Year (2) **]
   picture.
   - appreciate surgical input, called for consult
 surgery likely too
   risky.  Cont to follow.
   - rivers protocol for sepsis, though tolerate MAP > 60
   - f/u cultures
   - cont broad spectrim antibiotics
   - add caspo for yeast in multiple places
   - change vanc to PR given edematous bowel and likely poor absorption
   - appreciate ID recs
   - appreciate  liver recs
   - albumin PRN for intravascular volume, gage by CVP goal [**8-5**]
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] protocol ventilation, wean peep and fiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation

   - ventilation as above
   - esophageal balloon
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Pancolitis as above.  Guaiac positive.  Sigmoidoscopy
   during recent admission showed mild dysplasia.
   - repeat scope in [**Month (only) **] per GI fellow
   - guaiac all stools
   - f/u with surgery re: indication for surgery as status changes
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.
   Stable.  Urine lytes prerenal.
   - adequate fluid resuscitation
   - follow UCx
   - will trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Chronic Hepatitis C: Recent paracentesis concerning for SBP, though
   aseptic on culture.   Very small amount of ascites, too small to tap at
   bedside and not likely enough for SBP.
   - liver recs
   - follow LFTs
   - broad spectrum antibiotics  as above
   .
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now.
   - insulin drip now off
   - SSI
   .
   # Asthma: intubated
   .
   # Anemia: admitted with near baseline level.  Mildy decreased after
   fluid resuscitation.
   - trend HCT, goal > 30.
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and a previous inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis management.

24-hour events include the discontinuation of Xigris due to abnormal coagulation, weaning off paralytics, identification of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and advancement of the endotracheal tube.

Allergies include reactions to aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin, Levaquin, Cefzil, Motrin, and erythromycin base.

Infusions include vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed).

Medical and family history are unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 mmHg to 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), chronic viral hepatitis (HCV), and cocaine abuse. She presented with septic shock of unclear etiology, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has pancolitis and is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Differential diagnoses for sepsis include C. diff colitis, peritonitis/suppurative bacterial peritonitis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) colonization.

24-hour events:
- Xigris was stopped due to very high coagulation parameters and clinical improvement.
- Ventilation was weaned a little after following the recruitment protocol on ARDSnet.
- Paralytics were weaned off.
- The patient tested positive for C. diff at OSH.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock, HCV, CVID, and cdiff colitis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and has multiple medical complications including diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and pneumonia. The patient is also known to have a history of cocaine abuse. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her various conditions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state (CVID) and colonization with VRE. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of laboratory parameters are necessary to detect any signs of infection early.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress and lead to worsening respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation levels and adjusting ventilator settings as per ARDSnet protocol are essential.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure needs close monitoring of renal function tests and fluid balance to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's chronic viral hepatitis may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure. Regular assessment of liver function tests and monitoring of mental status is important.
5. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes needs careful monitoring and management to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Sepsis: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of persistent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and a past medical history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently on a Rivers protocol for sepsis treatment. The patient also has respiratory distress, which has shown some improvement with recruitment maneuvers, and an esophageal balloon has been placed. She is also experiencing anemia, coagulopathy, and chronic hepatitis C. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, so it is crucial to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory values, and response to antibiotics. Adjustments in the antibiotic regimen may be necessary based on culture results.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ventilation settings should be adjusted accordingly. Weaning of sedation and extubation should be considered when appropriate.

3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function should be regularly assessed by trending creatinine levels and avoiding nephrotoxic medications. Adequate fluid resuscitation and avoidance of further renal insult are essential.

4. Chronic Hepatitis C: Monitoring liver function tests ("

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient with persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate up to 10 this AM.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas
   - Attempt PO Vancomycin via NGT
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue Meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage in the
   setting of sepsis
   - add caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from urine and
   BAL fluid, although this likely represents colonization
   - check beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - Ultrasound guided paracentesis today to evaluate SBP as possible
   source of infection
   - appreciate ID recs
   - albumin PRN CVP < 10
   - f/u cultures
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - continue recruitment maneuvers as needed
   - esophageal balloon
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Patient is now
   oliguric.
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - check UA
   - trend creatinine
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs. ARF.
   - follow lactate
   - check urine for ketones given anion gap this AM and lack of insulin
   administration over previous 24 hours
   - Consider dialysis if acidosis fails to correct
   .
   # Hepatic failure:  Transaminitis with rising t. bilirubin likely
   reflects shock liver superimposed on chronic hepatitis C.
   - trend LFT
   - ultrasound-guided paracenteis today to evaluate for SBP
   .
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now, has not received insulin since
   titrated off insulin drip.  Now with anion gap.
   - check urine for ketones
   - resume insulin drip + D5 1/2NS, as DKA may be contributing to
   metabolic acidosis
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**].
   - trend HCT, goal > 28
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   # Coagulopathy:  In the settting of Xigris.  Xigris d/c
d [**2-15**].
   Improving coags.
   - FFP to goal INR < 2 in preparation for paracentesis.
   # FEN:
   - Consider initiation of TPN pending stabilization.
   - Check EKG for Twaves given hyperkalemia
   # PPx: INR > 2 as DVT prophylaxis.  PPI, VAP bundle.
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED. Unable to improve access to quad lumen
   in setting of pressors and total fluid body overload.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a medical history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and a past history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) more than 20 years ago. She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin through a nasogastric tube, and meropenem. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible colonic resection if medical management fails.

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly secondary to severe infection. Recruitment maneuvers have been performed, and the patient's PEEP and FiO2 are being weaned as tolerated.

Additionally, the patient has acute kidney injury (ARF), possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the sepsis. The patient's urine output is being trended, and medications are being renally dosed.

The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, which could be secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), sepsis, or ARF. Lactate levels are being followed, and urine for ketones is being checked due to anion gap present this morning and lack of insulin administration over the previous 24"

   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Improvement in ABG since Friday.  Weaned off 1 of 3
   pressors, though unable to wean further.   Has now received IVIG and
   xigris.  Xigris stopped on [**2-15**] secondary to elevated coags and risk of
   bleeding thought to outway benefit.  Now growing cdiff on OSH stool
   cuture.  Other scutlures are significant for VRE + swab, and UCx as
   well as mini BAL growing yeast.  Pulm status is complicated by an [**Month/Year (2) **]
   picture.
   - appreciate surgical input, called for consult
 surgery likely too
   risky.  Cont to follow.
   - rivers protocol for sepsis, though tolerate MAP > 60
   - f/u cultures
   - cont broad spectrim antibiotics
   - add caspo for yeast in multiple places
   - change vanc to PR given edematous bowel and likely poor absorption
   - appreciate ID recs
   - appreciate  liver recs
   - albumin PRN for intravascular volume, gage by CVP goal [**8-5**]
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] protocol ventilation, wean peep and fiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   .
   # Resp distress:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.  ?
   [**Month/Year (2) **].
   - ventilation as above
   - esophageal balloon
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Pancolitis as above.  Guaiac positive.  Sigmoidoscopy
   during recent admission showed mild dysplasia.
   - repeat scope in [**Month (only) **] per GI fellow
   - guaiac all stools
   - f/u with surgery re: indication for surgery as status changes
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.
   Stable.  Urine lytes prerenal.
   - adequate fluid resuscitation
   - follow UCx
   - will trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Chronic Hepatitis C: Recent paracentesis concerning for SBP, though
   aseptic on culture.   Very small amount of ascites, too small to tap at
   bedside and not likely enough for SBP.
   - liver recs
   - follow LFTs
   - broad spectrum antibiotics  as above
   .

   Shock: septic, improved leukocytosis but high 3-pressor requirement. No

   colloid/crystalloid resuscitation. I discussed the case with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

   case with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4824**] [**Name (STitle) 488**] who recommended continuing retention enemas
   and strongly considering colectomy as the risk without surgery is
   likely outweighed by the surgical risk. I have consulted Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and chronic viral hepatitis. She presented with septic shock of unclear etiology, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has pancolitis and is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure and hepatic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which suggests a systemic infection. It is important to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy to manage this condition.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient developed ARDS, likely secondary to sepsis. This condition can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient tested positive for C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis and contribute to sepsis. Treatment with antibiotics, such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin, may be necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal parameters and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be required.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible hepatic dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes and addressing the underlying cause are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type I, chronic viral hepatitis, and common variable immune deficiency. The patient is currently critically ill in the ICU with several medical complications.

The patient's main issues include:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure and inadequate tissue perfusion. Despite resuscitative efforts, the patient remains hypotensive.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has developed ARDS, a severe lung condition that impairs oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's oxygenation has improved, but she is still dependent on high levels of supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient is positive for C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. This may contribute to the patient's shock and overall poor condition.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. This may be due to sepsis or acute kidney injury.
5. Chronic Viral Hepatitis: The patient has chronic viral hepatitis, which can contribute to liver dysfunction and potential complications.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type I: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes, which may be exacerbated by stress and illness.

Potential medical complications that can arise include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, and cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock of unclear etiology and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been diagnosed with pancolitis and is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She also has chronic viral hepatitis, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff colitis: The patient is positive for C. diff, which can cause severe colitis and lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can result in respiratory failure and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Complications may include pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, indicated by elevated BUN levels and decreased urine output. This can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially multiple organ failure. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Diabetes management: As the patient has type I diabetes, it is essential to monitor and manage her blood glucose levels closely to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis ("

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 64-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type I, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic viral hepatitis, acute renal failure, colitis, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced several significant events. The third dose of neosynephrine was administered, and caspofungin was started empirically due to fungal markers and cultures being sent. An insulin drip was restarted with D51/2NS because of an anion gap with ketonuria. Four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were transfused to achieve an INR goal of less than 2 prior to a paracentesis. The patient's ventilatory requirements increased, necessitating the use of PEEP 24 and FiO2 100%. Recruitment maneuvers were performed, but the patient remained persistently acidemic with a pH as low as 7.15. A dialysis line was placed and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was initiated. The patient also experienced a brief episode of cardiac arrhythmia, suspected to be atrial fibrillation, although it was not captured on the EKG. A second surgical consult was obtained, and the patient's code status was addressed, with the family wishing for her to remain full code"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old lady with a medical history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and a distant history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was diagnosed with sepsis and treated with Xigris and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient's condition remains critical, and she is now experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hepatic failure, and anemia. Multiple interventions have been initiated to address these complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to Clostridium difficile infection. She is being treated with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and intravenous metronidazole. If medical management fails, surgical consultation for colonic resection may be considered.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Recruitment maneuvers have improved her condition, and weaning of PEEP and FiO2 is being attempted as tolerated. Continued recruitment maneuvers and esophageal balloon monitoring will be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may have ARF, possibly secondary to Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a medical history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by Clostridium difficile infection. She also has severe metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (ARF), hepatic failure, and anemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing sepsis, which is a systemic response to infection. The presumed source of infection is Clostridium difficile. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem), antifungal medication (caspofungin), and surgical consultation for possible colonic resection if medical management fails.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has persistent severe metabolic acidosis, possibly secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), sepsis, or ARF. Management includes correcting electrolyte imbalances, monitoring lactate levels, checking urine for ketones, and considering dialysis if acidosis fails to correct.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. Weaning of PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, continuation of recruitment maneuvers, and esophageal"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate up to ~9.
   Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to
   Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd for elevated PTT, and off HCO3. Weaning
   vent slowly.Off and on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but they
   are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 24. US tap for 1.7 L.
   24 Hour Events:
   Added 3rd pressor due to hypotension. Started on caspofungin for
   increased risk of fungal infection. Transitioned off insulin gtt, but
   did not recieve any long acting insulin, restarted insulin gtt due to
   increased SAG of 25. Given 4 U FFP for INR goal <2 for paracentesis.
   Increased hypoxemia, PEEP up 24 on 100% FiO2. Recruitment maneuvers.
   Respiratory and metabolic acidosis worsening. Groin HD line placed for
   CVVH. Had some irrgular rhythym during HD line. Had lactate up to 10,
   surgical consult called, unlikely to survive [**Doctor First Name 91**], so family decided to
   cont. medical mangement.
   PEEP then weaned to 20, and FiO2 50%. Neo was stopped, levophed being
   weaned. Redosed meropenem. Hct dropped from 29% to 21%, transfused.
   D51/2NS to D10.

   42 yrold CVID, DM, recent admission for pancolitis, now with cdiff
   sepsis, ARDS with high vent requirements for hypoxemic and hypercapneic
   respiratory failure, new ARF with anuria and progressive acidosis
   requiring initiation of CVVH last night.
   Started on caspofungin for empiric treatment given high risk. Also
   restarted on IV insulin. Serum ketones negative. Since last night, neo
   stopped, levophed decreased to 0.08. Lactate decreased
   from 10 yesterday to 5.7. Tolerating CVVH, remains paralysed. Vent
   requirements have improved. Currently on A/C 380x26, peep 20, FiO2 50%.
   This AM's ABG much improved at 7.38/37/89. Sedated on fentanyl and
   versed and paralysed on cisatracurium. Wbc , Hct decreased from 28.7 to
   21, transfused 2 u PRBC. Tbili 11.9, smear and hemolysis workup
   pending.
   Meds reviewed: on caspofungin, pr vanco, [**Last Name (un) **] 1 gm q12, flagyl IV. CXR
   reviewed - improved aeration
   Impression - significant improvement overnight since starting CVVH. New
   issue is acute anemia, unclear if bleeding or hemolysis. Workup is
   pending. Will keep vent on current settings as she has responded well
   to high peep. Will review transpulm pressures today. The risk of
   colectomy is very high but appears to be improving. Appreciate the
   input from both Dr [**First Name (STitle) 744**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1051**]. TPN will need to be started
   over the next few days but access is currently an issue.
   Plan:
   1. ID/ C Diff: Cont. IV flagyl and PR vanco enemas and instillation in
   OG. Surgery following. On meropenem for sepsis, ID following. Also on
   caspofungin for diffuse colonization and risk factors.
   2. Sepsis: EGDT for now, CVVh to get CVP down.
   3. Resp: ARDS, PEEP 20
   Checking esophageal balloon, goal transpulmonary pressure <10
   4. Metabolic acidosis and Resp acidosis: Continuing insulin for
   possible DKA, do not hold gtt, use D10 to keep BSS 100-130
   5. ARF: Suspect ATN, cont. CVVH for acidosis and fluid overload
   6. Liver failure: Check fibrinogen, likely shock liver
   7. Anemia: No clear bleeding source, check hemolysis labs, goal hct>25
   while may be bleeding, q8h hct, guiac stool, look at a peripheral smear
   for schistocytes, trend plts
   8. Coagulapathy: Possible DIC vs xigris weaning off, goal INR <2 if
   bleeding
   9. FEN: [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC in next 2 days for TPN, hold for now given
   concern for fungus

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old individual with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency), and recent admission for pancolitis. They have developed cdiff sepsis, ARDS, renal failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and have undergone multiple interventions including CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration), caspofungin therapy, and various other treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ID/C Diff: The patient has been diagnosed with cdiff sepsis and is being treated with IV flagyl and PR vanco enemas. Surgery may follow. The risk of colectomy is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being managed with EGDT (Early Goal-Directed Therapy), CVVH to reduce CVP (Central Venous Pressure), and meropenem for sepsis.
3. Resp: The patient has ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and is currently on PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) at 20 cmH2O.
4. Metabolic Acidosis and Resp Acidosis: Insulin infusion is being used to manage possible DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) and maintain BSS (Blood Sugar) levels between 100-130 mg/dL.
5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): CVVH is being continued for acidosis and fluid overload, suspecting ATN (Ac"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate up to ~9.
   Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to
   Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd for elevated PTT, and off HCO3. Weaning
   vent slowly.Off and on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but they r
   still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if needed,
   which is now at 24. US tap for 1.7 L.
   24 Hour Events:
   Added 3rd pressor due to hypotension. Started on caspofungin for
   increased risk of fungal infection. Transitioned off insulin gtt, but
   did not recieve any long acting insulin, restarted insulin gtt due to
   increased SAG of 25. Given 4 U FFP for INR goal <2 for paracentesis.
   Increased hypoxemia, PEEP up 24 on 100% FiO2. Recruitment maneuvers.
   Respiratory and metabolic acidosis worsening. Groin HD line placed for
   CVVH. Had some irrgular rhythym during HD line. Had lactate up to 10,
   surgical consult called, unlikely to survive [**Doctor First Name 91**], so family decided to
   cont. medical mangement.
   PEEP then weaned to 20, and FiO2 50%. Neo was stopped, levophed being
   weaned. Redosed meropenem. Hct dropped from 29% to 21%, transfused.
   D51/2NS to D10.
 PARACENTESIS - At [**2189-2-17**] 04:00 PM 1.5 L
 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2189-2-17**] 07:22 PM CVVH started with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), and recent admission for sepsis attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. The patient has a vague history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the past. They were treated with antibiotics and discharged but readmitted within 24 hours due to abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, and developed septic shock. The patient also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). A CT scan showed persistent bowel wall thickening, but the gastrointestinal (GI) team was not convinced it was true colitis (versus edema). The patient rapidly deteriorated, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), required full ventilator support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, and had elevated lactate levels. The patient then started to improve, and weaning from the ventilator began. The patient is currently on multiple pressors, vasopressin, and receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). They have a central venous catheter (CVC) and arterial line in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient requires insulin infusion for glycemic control.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, and the PEEP has been adjusted to 20 cm"

   HPI:
   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate up to ~9.
   Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to
   Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd for elevated PTT, and off HCO3. Weaning
   vent slowly.Off and on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but they
   are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 24. US tap for 1.7 L.
   24 Hour Events:
   Added 3rd pressor due to hypotension. Started on caspofungin for
   increased risk of fungal infection. Transitioned off insulin gtt, but
   did not recieve any long acting insulin, restarted insulin gtt due to
   increased SAG of 25. Given 4 U FFP for INR goal <2 for paracentesis.
   Increased hypoxemia, PEEP up 24 on 100% FiO2. Recruitment maneuvers.
   Respiratory and metabolic acidosis worsening. Groin HD line placed for
   CVVH. Had some irrgular rhythym during HD line. Had lactate up to 10,
   surgical consult called, unlikely to survive [**Doctor First Name 91**], so family decided to
   cont. medical mangement.
   PEEP then weaned to 20, and FiO2 50%. Neo was stopped, levophed being
   weaned. Redosed meropenem. Hct dropped from 29% to 21%, transfused.
   D51/2NS to D10.

   Patient was seen and examined with housestaff and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1516**]. Her note
   above reflects our discussion. I would add the following:
   42 yrold CVID, DM, recent admission for pancolitis, now with cdiff
   sepsis, ARDS with high vent requirements for hypoxemic and hypercapneic
   respiratory failure, new ARF with anuria and progressive acidosis
   requiring initiation of CVVH last night.
   Started on caspofungin for empiric treatment given high risk. Also
   restarted on IV insulin. Serum ketones negative. Since last night, neo
   stopped, levophed decreased to 0.08. Lactate decreased
   from 10 yesterday to 5.7. Tolerating CVVH, remains paralysed. Vent
   requirements have improved. Currently on A/C 380x26, peep 20, FiO2 50%.
   This AM's ABG much improved at 7.38/37/89. Sedated on fentanyl and
   versed and paralysed on cisatracurium. Wbc , Hct decreased from 28.7 to
   21, transfused 2 u PRBC. Tbili 11.9, smear and hemolysis workup
   pending.
   Meds reviewed: on caspofungin, pr vanco, [**Last Name (un) **] 1 gm q12, flagyl IV. CXR
   reviewed - improved aeration
   Impression - significant improvement overnight since starting CVVH. New
   issue is acute anemia, unclear if bleeding or hemolysis. Workup is
   pending. Will keep vent on current settings as she has responded well
   to high peep. Will review transpulm pressures today. The risk of
   colectomy is very high but appears to be improving. Appreciate the
   input from both Dr [**First Name (STitle) 744**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1051**]. TPN will need to be started
   over the next few days but access is currently an issue.  50 minutes
   critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of CVID, DM, and recent admission for pancolitis, who is now presenting with cdiff sepsis, ARDS, new ARF, and high vent requirements for hypoxemic and hypercapneic respiratory failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, caspofungin, and CVVH. Her condition has shown improvement, with decreased lactate levels, improved ABG results, and better tolerating CVVH. She remains paralyzed and sedated on fentanyl and versed. The patient's medications include caspofungin, pr vanco, and flagyl IV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has cdiff sepsis, and there is a risk of further complications or spread of infection.
2. ARDS: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by anuria and progressive acidosis. This may require ongoing CVVH support and close monitoring of renal function.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 28.7 to 21, indicating significant blood loss or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 3.1, indicating a"

   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate up to ~9.
   Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to
   Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd for elevated PTT, and off HCO3. Weaning
   vent slowly.Off and on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but they
   are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 24. US tap for 1.7 L.
   24 Hour Events:
   Added 3rd pressor due to hypotension. Started on caspofungin for
   increased risk of fungal infection. Transitioned off insulin gtt, but
   did not recieve any long acting insulin, restarted insulin gtt due to
   increased SAG of 25. Given 4 U FFP for INR goal <2 for paracentesis.
   Increased hypoxemia, PEEP up 24 on 100% FiO2. Recruitment maneuvers.
   Respiratory and metabolic acidosis worsening. Groin HD line placed for
   CVVH. Had some irrgular rhythym during HD line. Had lactate up to 10,
   surgical consult called, unlikely to survive [**Doctor First Name 91**], so family decided to
   cont. medical mangement.
   PEEP then weaned to 20, and FiO2 50%. Neo was stopped, levophed being
   weaned. Redosed meropenem. Hct dropped from 29% to 21%, transfused.
   D51/2NS to D10.
 PARACENTESIS - At [**2189-2-17**] 04:00 PM 1.5 L
 DIALYSIS CATHETER - START [**2189-2-17**] 07:22 PM CVVH started with
   improvement of acidosis.

   Plan:
   1. ID/ C Diff: Cont. IV flagyl and PR vanco enemas and instillation in
   OG. Surgery following. On meropenem for sepsis, ID following. Also on
   caspofungin for diffuse colonization and risk factors.
   2. Sepsis: EGDT for now, CVVh to get CVP down.
   3. Resp: ARDS, PEEP 20
   Checking esophageal balloon, goal transpulmonary pressure <10
   4. Metabolic acidosis and Resp acidosis: Continuing insulin for
   possible DKA, do not hold gtt, use D10 to keep BSS 100-130
   5. ARF: Suspect ATN, cont. CVVH for acidosis and fluid overload
   6. Liver failure: Check fibrinogen, likely shock liver
   7. Anemia: No clear bleeding source, check hemolysis labs, goal hct>25
   while may be bleeding, q8h hct, guiac stool, look at a peripheral smear
   for schistocytes, trend plts
   8. Coagulapathy: Possible DIC vs xigris weaning off, goal INR <2 if
   bleeding
   9. FEN: [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC in next 2 days for TPN, hold for now given
   concern for fungus

   Attending Addendum:
   Patient was seen and examined with housestaff and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1516**]. Her note
   above reflects our discussion. I would add the following:
   42 yrold CVID, DM, recent admission for pancolitis, now with cdiff
   sepsis, ARDS with high vent requirements for hypoxemic and hypercapneic
   respiratory failure, new ARF with anuria and progressive acidosis
   requiring initiation of CVVH last night.
   Started on caspofungin for empiric treatment given high risk. Also
   restarted on IV insulin. Serum ketones negative. Since last night, neo
   stopped, levophed decreased to 0.08. Lactate decreased
   from 10 yesterday to 5.7. Tolerating CVVH, remains paralysed. Vent
   requirements have improved. Currently on A/C 380x26, peep 20, FiO2 50%.
   This AM's ABG much improved at 7.38/37/89. Sedated on fentanyl and
   versed and paralysed on cisatracurium. Wbc , Hct decreased from 28.7 to
   21, transfused 2 u PRBC. Tbili 11.9, smear and hemolysis workup
   pending.
   Meds reviewed: on caspofungin, pr vanco, [**Last Name (un) **] 1 gm q12, flagyl IV. CXR
   reviewed - improved aeration
   Impression - significant improvement overnight since starting CVVH. New
   issue is acute anemia, unclear if bleeding or hemolysis. Workup is
   pending. Will keep vent on current settings as she has responded well
   to high peep. Will review transpulm pressures today. The risk of
   colectomy is very high but appears to be improving. Appreciate the
   input from both Dr [**First Name (STitle) 744**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1051**]. TPN will need to be started
   over the next few days but access is currently an issue.  50 minutes
   critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of CVID, DM, recent admission for pancolitis, and current diagnosis of C. diff sepsis, ARDS, acute renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and other colitis. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis and ARDS. She has been on multiple pressors, including Norepinephrine, Vasopressin, and Levo. She developed ARDS and required full vent support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. Her condition improved, and she was weaned off some of the medications, but then deteriorated again due to hypotension and increased lactate levels. She required CVVH for acidosis and fluid overload. She also had anemia with a decreased Hct from 28.7 to 21, and was transfused with 2 units of PRBC. Her TBili was elevated at 11.9, and hemolysis workup is pending. She has shown significant improvement since starting CVVH and is currently on A/C 380x26, PEEP 20, FiO2 50%. She remains sedated on fentanyl and versed, and paralyzed on cisatracurium. Her ABG improved to 7.38/37/89. She is still a poor surgical candidate but is improving. The plan includes continuing insulin for possible DKA, CVVH for acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
   # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue Meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage in the
   setting of sepsis
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, although this likely represents colonization
   mycolytic fungal cultures and beta-glucan galactomannan return
   negative, can discontinue caspo
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as per ARDSnet protocol
   - continue recruitment maneuvers as needed
   - daily trial of no paralytics
   - esophageal balloon
   - Target transpulmonary pressure = 0
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Patient [**Name (NI) **] continues
   to be roughly 20cc/hr
   - cont cvvh
   - goal cvp 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - check UA
   - trend creatinine
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs. ARF.   Corrected
   with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont cvvh per renal
   - cont D10 and insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 6 lytes
   # Hepatic failure:  Transaminitis with rising t. bilirubin likely
   reflects shock liver superimposed on chronic hepatitis C.  Also could
   be component of hemolysis in rising bili.
   - trend LFT
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now, on insulin gtt and D10 with
   resolving anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - IVF with D10
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] and 2 units
   this AM (total 4 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs suggestive of
   hemolysis, though no schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
   - trend HCT q 6, goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - follow hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   # Coagulopathy:  In the settting of Xigris.  Xigris d/c
d [**2-15**].
   Improving coags.
   - FFP if evidence of bleeding
   # Eosinophilia: elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics.  No apparent rash.
   - follow eos for now
   # FEN:
   - Consider initiation of TPN pending stabilization, access is a
   problem.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  PPI, VAP bundle.
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED. Unable to improve access to quad lumen
   in setting of pressors and total fluid body overload.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and a distant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up. She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), metabolic acidosis, hepatic failure, anemia, coagulopathy, eosinophilia, and possible DVT prophylaxis. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, caspofungin, insulin gtt, D10W, and pantoprazole (Protonix). 

She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 20 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. She is also receiving norepinephrine, vasopressin, regular insulin, cisatracurium, midazolam (Versed), calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, and potassium chloride (CRRT). 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's urine output has been consistently low at around 20cc/hr, and she is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and a distant history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a presumed source of infection due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She is receiving treatment with Vancomycin retention enemas, oral Vancomycin, and intravenous Flagyl. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Meropenem is also being continued.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe infection. She is on mechanical ventilation with recruitment maneuvers and weaning of PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function may be compromised due to sepsis and possibly ATN (acute tubular necrosis). Monitoring urine output and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is essential.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has corrected overnight with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Monitoring lactate and anion"

   ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old with a history of hep C cirrhosis, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and recent admission for severe colitis. The patient has been readmitted within 24 hours due to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and development of septic shock. The patient has also been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). 

The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated and required triple pressors, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) administration, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required full ventilatory support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. Lactate levels increased, but the patient has since improved.

The patient is currently on vasoactive medications (levo and vaso) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acidosis and fluid removal. The patient is also receiving insulin for diabetes mellitus type I. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible hepatic involvement. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including diabetes mellitus type I, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cocaine abuse, acute renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, colitis (not Clostridium difficile), severe sepsis, and pneumonia. 

The plan of care includes treating sepsis with antibiotics, weaning off pressors, initiating CVVH for renal failure, and providing supportive care. The patient's condition"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old with a history of hep C cirrhosis, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and recent admission for sepsis attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. The patient had a vague history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the past. They were treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**date**]. However, they were readmitted within 24 hours due to abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, and developed septic shock. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). CT scan showed persistent bowel wall thickening, but the gastrointestinal (GI) team was not convinced it was true colitis (versus edema). The patient rapidly deteriorated on [**date**] at pm, requiring triple pressors, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) infusion, Xigris, and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring full ventilator support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. Lactate levels were elevated up to ~9. The patient then started to improve on [**date**] at am, and weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated. The patient is currently on vasopressin and levo, with Xigris discontinued due to elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient's condition is still critical, but they have shown signs of improvement.

   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue Meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage in the
   setting of sepsis
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, although this likely represents colonization
   mycolytic fungal cultures and beta-glucan galactomannan return
   negative, can discontinue caspo

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and a previous inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up. She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 

Assessment:
1. Sepsis: Presumed source is Clostridium difficile infection in this patient with CVID, now treated with Xigris (activated protein C) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient had persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels which improved with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Multiple blood cultures were negative.
2. Respiratory failure: Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers. Likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of severe infection, chest X-ray improved today.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): Possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given sepsis. The patient continues to have a urine output of approximately 20 cc/hr.
4. Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) vs. sepsis vs. ARF. Corrected with CVVH.
5. Hepatic failure: Transaminitis with rising total bilirubin likely reflects shock liver superimposed on chronic hepatitis C. Also, could be a component of hemolysis in rising bilirubin.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - discontinue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, as this likely represents colonization and
   caspofungin may be contributing to thrombocytopenia
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG today
   - currently on Vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as per ARDSnet protocol
   - continue recruitment maneuvers as needed
   - daily trial of no paralytics
   - esophageal balloon
   - Target transpulmonary pressure = 0
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  UOP improving.
   - cont CVVH with goal 3 liters negative today
   - goal cvp 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - check urine eos given peripheral eosinophilia
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs. ARF.   Corrected
   with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont D10 and insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - d/c D10 once TPN started
   - q 6 lytes as per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis.
   Patient has blood oozing from multiple sites, consistent with DIC.
   HIT 4T score of 3 (2 points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point
   for  fall occurring > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient
   was on SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from
   [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only
   received two doses of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on
   [**2-13**].   Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with
   possible offending agents including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.
   TTP-HUS less likely given lack of  microangiopathic findings on the
   peripheral blood smear.
   -          Check FDP as would expected this to be elevated if due to
   DIC
   -          Transfuse platelets if evidence of bleeding
   -          Hematology consult
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with oozing as above, given probable DIC.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Review peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now, on insulin gtt and D10 with
   resolving anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - discontinue D10W once TPN with dextrose infusion is initiated
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics.  No apparent rash.
   -          Check urine eos
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued
   # FEN:
   -          Initiate TPN as per Nutrition recs, following PICC placement
   -          Goal I/O: - 3 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - d/c PPI pending resolution of thrombocytopenia although current
   indications for GI ppx include ARF, elevated INR, intubation
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED.
   - PICC today for initiation of TPN

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and a past history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) presenting with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be due to Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and metronidazole, as well as IVIG.

She also has respiratory failure, possibly secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ARF), possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis. The patient's metabolic acidosis has improved with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

She has thrombocytopenia with a low fibrinogen level and elevated INR, which may suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents including Linezolid, PPI, and Caspofungin.

The patient has anemia, likely secondary to blood loss associated with DIC. She has received multiple blood transfusions. 

She also has eosinophilia, which may suggest an allergic reaction to antibiotics. 

The patient's diabetes is currently being managed with an insulin infusion.

Her nutritional needs are being met with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

She is currently"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate increased,
   now improved. Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM.
   Now down to Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd on [**2-14**] for elevated PTT, and
   off HCO3. Weaning vent slowly. Off/on/off paralytics. Poor surgical
   candidate, but they are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to
   increase peep if needed, which is now at 20. US tap for 1.7 L.
   Currently on PEEP 20 FiO2 50%, have been adjusting with esophageal
   balloon. On levo and vaso and CVVH for acidosis and fluid removal. Also
   on insulin gtt for DKA.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of hep C cirrhosis, common variable immune deficiency (CVID), and recent admission for sepsis attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. The patient has a vague history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the past. He was treated with antibiotics and discharged but readmitted within 24 hours due to abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, and developed septic shock. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was confirmed. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, requiring triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, and full ventilatory support with paralysis/recruitment maneuvers. Lactate levels increased, but then the patient improved. The patient is now down to vasopressin and levo, Xigris was discontinued due to elevated PTT, and off HCO3. The patient is being weaned off the ventilator slowly, with intermittent use of paralytics. The patient is a poor surgical candidate but is still being followed. Transtubular potassium difference (TPP) is close to 0, allowing for increased peep if needed, currently at 20. An ultrasound-guided tap for 1.7 liters of ascites was performed. The patient is on levo, vaso, CVVH for acidosis and fluid removal, and insulin gtt for diabetic ketoacidosis"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admit for sepsis
   attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. Vague hx of
   IBD in past. Treated with antibiotics and discharged on [**2-11**]. Readmit
   within 24 hours because of abdominal pain, N/V, fever, developed septic
   shock. OSH cdiff +. CT showed persistent bowel wall thickening but GI
   not convinced it's true colitis (vs. edema). She rapidly deteriorated
   [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3 gtt, Xigris, developed ARDS requiring
   full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate increased,
   now improved. Then, she turned a corner and started to improve [**2-14**] AM.
   Now down to Vaso and Levo, Xigris d/c'd on [**2-14**] for elevated PTT, and
   off HCO3. Weaning vent slowly. Off/on/off paralytics. Poor surgical
   candidate, but they are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to
   increase peep if needed, which is now at 20. US tap for 1.7 L.
   Currently on PEEP 20 FiO2 50%, have been adjusting with esophageal
   balloon. On levo and vaso and CVVH for acidosis and fluid removal. Also
   on insulin gtt for DKA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of hep C cirrhosis, CVID, recent admission for sepsis attributed to ""colitis"" due to bowel wall thickening on CT. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure, hepatitis C, colitis, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/C. Diff: The patient is at risk for recurrent sepsis and Clostridium difficile infection due to recent antibiotic use and ongoing immunosuppression.
2. Resp Failure: The patient has ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
3. ATN: The patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and the need for CVVH.
4. DM1: The patient has newly diagnosed type I diabetes mellitus and requires insulin infusion and careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.
5. Heme: The patient has developed hemolysis and requires further evaluation with smear examination, Coombs test, and follow-up with hematology recommendations.
6. FEN: The patient requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the inability to tolerate enteral feeding.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP to 12 and FiO2 40% today
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with
   nearly 1L urine output yesterday.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2 liters negative today
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - check urine eos given peripheral eosinophilia
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now given intraabdominal process, on
   insulin gtt with resolved anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued
   -          f/u stool O&P

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and eosinophilia. She has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care. The patient's condition has been complex with multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and current condition suggest severe sepsis. She has a presumed source of infection from Clostridium difficile. Close monitoring for signs of septic shock and organ dysfunction is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), evidenced by her requirement for mechanical ventilation and improved oxygenation with recruitment maneuvers. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously, and monitoring for any signs of reintubation will be important.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is concerning and may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug-induced thrombocytopenia, or other causes. Platelet transfusion may be necessary if there is evidence of bleeding or if the platelet count"

   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - discontinue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, as this likely represents colonization and
   caspofungin may be contributing to thrombocytopenia
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG today
   - currently on Vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as per ARDSnet protocol
   - continue recruitment maneuvers as needed
   - daily trial of no paralytics
   - esophageal balloon
   - Target transpulmonary pressure = 0
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  UOP improving.
   - cont CVVH with goal 3 liters negative today
   - goal cvp 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - check urine eos given peripheral eosinophilia
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs. ARF.   Corrected
   with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont D10 and insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - d/c D10 once TPN started
   - q 6 lytes as per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis.
   Patient has blood oozing from multiple sites, consistent with DIC.
   HIT 4T score of 3 (2 points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point
   for  fall occurring > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient
   was on SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from
   [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only
   received two doses of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on
   [**2-13**].   Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with
   possible offending agents including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.
   TTP-HUS less likely given lack of  microangiopathic findings on the
   peripheral blood smear.
   -          Check FDP as would expected this to be elevated if due to
   DIC
   -          Transfuse platelets if evidence of bleeding
   -          Hematology consult
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with oozing as above, given probable DIC.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Review peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now, on insulin gtt and D10 with
   resolving anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - discontinue D10W once TPN with dextrose infusion is initiated
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics.  No apparent rash.
   -          Check urine eos
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued
   # FEN:
   -          Initiate TPN as per Nutrition recs, following PICC placement
   -          Goal I/O: - 3 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - d/c PPI pending resolution of thrombocytopenia although current
   indications for GI ppx include ARF, elevated INR, intubation
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED.
   - PICC today for initiation of TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection, and has been treated with IVIG and Xigris. The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ARF) possibly due to sepsis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has been receiving various medications including vasopressin, caspofungin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and infection. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with IVIG, antibiotics, and supportive care.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously following ARDSnet protocol. Recruitment maneuvers and daily trials of no paralytics should be continued.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient may have ARF, possibly secondary to sepsis or ATN. CVVH should"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, admitted with severe C. Diff
   and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3
   gtt, Xigris (only completed 12h due to rising coags), developed ARDS
   requiring full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate
   increased. Started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to Vaso alone. Weaning
   vent slowly. Off/on/off/on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but
   they are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 20. US tap for 1.7 L, which improved bladder
   pressure from 25 to 12. Currently on PEEP 20 FiO2 50%, have been
   adjusting with esophageal balloon. Able to be weaned off pressors but
   continued on vaso/levo for fluid removal on CVVH. Also on insulin gtt
   for DKA.
   24 Hour Events:
   Got IVIG. PICC placed and repositioned. Desatted at IR was on 100%,
   weaned back down to 50%. PEEP weaned to 14 overnight. FiO2 at 50%. TPN
   started. Heme was consulted, rec Fe studies, cryos, HIT Ab, and to give
   cryo. Smear shows no schistocytes. FDP elevated. Fibrinogen stayed
   above 100. Weaned off vasopressin, restarted to aid in fluid removal,
   added levo as well for fluid removal. Some oozing from OG tube. Vit K
   given. B glucan came back positive (although may be [**1-26**] albumin) so
   continuing caspofungin. Sent a HIT Ab. Although last heparin was given
   sc on [**2-13**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of hep C cirrhosis and CVID admitted to the ICU with severe C. Diff and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated and developed ARDS, requiring full vent support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. Her lactate levels increased, but she started to improve after being placed on vasopressor support. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation but has been weaned off some pressors. She also has poor surgical candidacy and is experiencing thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal failure, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin and flagyl, and surgery and ID following are planned.
2. Fungal Colonization: The patient's B-glucan test is positive, indicating a possible fungal infection. Caspofungin will be continued until fungal cultures return negative.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which requires ongoing management of her respiratory support. Titration of sedatives and analgesics will be done every 20%.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and DIC is suspected. Platelet transfusion will be given based on hemolysis labs and daily smear results.
5. Anemia: Hemolysis is suspected, and hemolysis labs and daily smear will be trended. The patient's"

   gtt, Xigris (only completed 12h due to rising coags), developed ARDS
   requiring full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate
   increased. Started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to Vaso alone. Weaning
   vent slowly. Off/on/off/on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but
   they are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 20. US tap for 1.7 L, which improved bladder
   pressure from 25 to 12. Currently on PEEP 20 FiO2 50%, have been
   adjusting with esophageal balloon. Able to be weaned off pressors but
   continued on vaso/levo for fluid removal on CVVH. Also on insulin gtt
   for DKA.
   24 Hour Events:
   Got IVIG. PICC placed and repositioned. Desatted at IR was on 100%,

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of hep C cirrhosis, common variable immune deficiency (CVID), and admitted with severe Clostridium difficile infection and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated, requiring full ventilatory support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. The patient's condition improved, and she was weaned off some of the respiratory support. She is still on vasopressor support for fluid removal and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has a severe C. difficile infection, which can lead to colitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to the C. difficile infection and her immune deficiency. Sepsis can progress to septic shock and cause organ dysfunction.
3. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) or rhabdomyolysis. Renal failure can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which may be caused by disseminated"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, admitted with severe C. Diff
   and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3
   gtt, Xigris (only completed 12h due to rising coags), developed ARDS
   requiring full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers, lactate
   increased. Started to improve [**2-14**] AM. Now down to Vaso alone. Weaning
   vent slowly. Off/on/off/on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate, but
   they are still following. TPP close to 0, so room to increase peep if
   needed, which is now at 20. US tap for 1.7 L, which improved bladder
   pressure from 25 to 12. Currently on PEEP 20 FiO2 50%, have been
   adjusting with esophageal balloon. Able to be weaned off pressors but
   continued on vaso/levo for fluid removal on CVVH. Also on insulin gtt
   for DKA.
   24 Hour Events:
   Got IVIG. PICC placed and repositioned. Desatted at IR was on 100%,
   weaned back down to 50%. PEEP weaned to 14 overnight. FiO2 at 50%. TPN
   started. Heme was consulted, rec Fe studies, cryos, HIT Ab, and to give
   cryo. Smear shows no schistocytes. FDP elevated. Fibrinogen stayed
   above 100. Weaned off vasopressin, restarted to aid in fluid removal,
   added levo as well for fluid removal. Some oozing from OG tube. Vit K
   given. B glucan came back positive (although may be [**1-26**] albumin) so
   continuing caspofungin. Sent a HIT Ab. Although last heparin was given
   sc on [**2-13**].

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of hep C cirrhosis, CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency), who was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated and developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), requiring full ventilator support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia with hemolysis, acute renal failure (possibly acute tubular necrosis), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), eosinophilia, and fungal colonization. The patient is currently weaning off the ventilator and pressors but remains on vasopressin and levo for fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Insulin is being given for DKA management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff: Continued vancomycin retention and dwell, IV flagyl surgery, and ID following.
2. Fungal colonization: B-glucan positive (although may be albumin), continue caspofungin until fungal culture negative.
3. Respiratory failure: ARDS due to C. diff infection. Completed 7 days of meropenem, although BAL was negative. Titrate down fentanyl and versed each 20%. Trial of holding paralytics today.

   Got IVIG. PICC placed and repositioned. Desatted at IR was on 100%,
   weaned back down to 50%. PEEP weaned to 14 overnight. FiO2 at 50%. TPN
   started. Heme was consulted, rec Fe studies, cryos, HIT Ab, and to give
   cryo. Smear shows no schistocytes. FDP elevated. Fibrinogen stayed
   above 100. Weaned off vasopressin, restarted to aid in fluid removal,
   added levo as well for fluid removal. Some oozing from OG tube. Vit K
   given. B glucan came back positive (although may be [**1-26**] albumin) so
   continuing caspofungin. Sent a HIT Ab. Although last heparin was given

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency) who presented to the ICU with sepsis, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and C. difficile infection. She has multiple medical complications including diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and colitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has several IV lines in place. She is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for fluid removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient has a positive B-glucan test indicating possible fungal colonization. She should continue caspofungin until fungal cultures return negative. Surgical consultation and ID (Infectious Disease) follow-up are recommended.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires continued support with mechanical ventilation. Titration of sedatives and analgesics should be done carefully.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) is suspected. Monitoring of fibrinogen levels and platelet count is necessary. Cryoprecipitate should be administered if fibrinogen levels are below 100 mg/dL.
4. Anemia: Hemolysis is suspected, and the patient's hemolysis labs should be trended. HCT (Hematocrit) should"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP to 12 and FiO2 40% today
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with
   nearly 1L urine output yesterday.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2 liters negative today
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - check urine eos given peripheral eosinophilia
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now given intraabdominal process, on
   insulin gtt with resolved anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and a distant history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently receiving treatment for the infection, including vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and IV flagyl. Surgical consultation has been requested for the possibility of colonic resection if medical management fails. Empiric coverage for yeast infection, as well as fungal cultures, is also being administered.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly related to severe infection. She is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The plan is to wean the PEEP to 12 and FiO2 to 40% today, with a daily trial of being off paralytics. An esophageal balloon will remain in place.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. A 4T score of 3 suggests a low probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and a past inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be due to a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely ARDS, thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and eosinophilia.

The patient has received various treatments including vasopressin, calcium gluconate, insulin, cisatracurium, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, potassium chloride, and other medications. She has undergone continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 109/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, also has B glucan positive
   - d/c caspofungin if mycolytic cultures are negative for 7 days
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 40%
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP.   Able
   to keep her approx 2.5 L with CVVH.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2.5 liters negative today
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I: On TPN also has insulin gtt.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued
   -          f/u stool O&P
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: - 2.5 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Carafate as GI prophylaxis (PPI discontinued in the setting of
   thrombocytopenia)

She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. She has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe infection.

The patient's medical team has implemented various treatment plans, including the administration of Vancomycin retention enemas, oral Vancomycin, and intravenous Flagyl for the C. difficile infection. They have also started caspofungin as empirical coverage for yeast cultured from urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Surgical consultation has been sought for the possibility of colonic resection if the patient does not improve with medical management.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is being managed with platelet transfusions and close monitoring of platelet counts. The team is also assessing for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) due to low fibrinogen levels, elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), and thrombocytopenia. The patient's anemia is being managed with red blood cell transfusions.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan, fungal cultures
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved yesterday with recruitment maneuvers.
   Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection, CXR improved today.
   - wean PEEP to 12 and FiO2 40% today
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with
   nearly 1L urine output yesterday.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2 liters negative today
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   - check urine eos given peripheral eosinophilia
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:  Patient is NPO for now given intraabdominal process, on
   insulin gtt with resolved anion gap.
   - continue insulin gtt protocol
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          caspofungin and meropenem discontinued
   -          f/u stool O&P
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: - 2 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Carafate as GI prophylaxis (PPI discontinued in the setting of
   thrombocytopenia)

","The patient is a 42-year-old lady with a history of CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, and distant IBD who presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have presumed sepsis secondary to a Clostridium difficile infection and was started on Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, and IV Flagyl. Surgical consult has been requested for possible colonic resection if medical management fails.

She also has respiratory failure likely due to ARDS, which improved with recruitment maneuvers. The plan is to wean PEEP to 12 and FiO2 to 40% today, with daily trials of paralytics off.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a low fibrinogen level, elevated INR, and evidence of mucosal bleeding. This could be suggestive of DIC. The patient has a low probability HIT score of 3, and drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a consideration. Transfuse platelets if evidence of bleeding or drop in HCT, maintain platelets >20K if no active bleeding, and check post-transfusion platelet count.

She has anemia likely due to blood loss associated with mucosal oozing and probable DIC. She has received a total of 5 units of PRBCs so far. Trend HCT, goal >25-28, and daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis.

   HPI:
    42 year old with hep C cirrhosis, CVID, admitted with severe C. Diff
   and sepsis. She rapidly deteriorated [**2-13**] pm, on triple pressors, HCO3
   gtt, Xigris (only completed 12h due to rising coags), developed ARDS
   requiring full vent support/paralysis/recruitment maneuvers. Started to
   improve [**2-14**] AM. Now just on small amount levo/vaso for fluid removal.
   Weaning vent slowly. Off/on/off/on paralytics. Poor surgical candidate,
   but they are still following. TPP was last 1 during expiration, so room
   to increase peep if needed, which is now at 12. US tap for 1.7 L, which
   improved bladder pressure from 25 to 12. Currently on PEEP 12 FiO2 40%,

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old with a history of hep C cirrhosis, CVID, who was admitted with severe C. Diff and sepsis. The patient rapidly deteriorated and required full vent support, paralysis, and recruitment maneuvers due to ARDS. They have shown improvement and are now on a small amount of levo/vaso for fluid removal. The patient is still on CVVH and insulin gtt for DKA. They are a poor surgical candidate but are still being considered for surgery. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have multiple medical complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), diabetes mellitus type 1, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cocaine abuse, renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, severe sepsis, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to C. Diff: The patient has already been treated with IVIG, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Continued monitoring and follow-up with ID recs are necessary.
2. ID: The patient has completed 8 days of meropenem and is continuing caspofungin for fungal colonization. If negative mycolytic for 7 days, the caspofungin should be stopped.
3. Respiratory: ARDS - The patient should be weaned to 0.4 FiO2 and tried off paralytic if they tolerate 0.4. Weaning of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. The summary of the note is as follows:

- The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body.
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus type I, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cocaine abuse, acute renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
- The patient's current treatment plan includes IV immunoglobulin for sepsis, continuation of antibiotics, weaning off respiratory support, management of acute renal failure, monitoring for thrombocytopenia, and maintaining glycemic control with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to prolonged ICU stay, use of invasive lines and devices, and immunocompromised state.
2. Bleeding: Due to DIC, the patient may experience bleeding complications due to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's ARDS may lead to further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening respiratory function.
4. Renal failure: Acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's pre-existing type I diabetes may be challenging to control during this critical illness, increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal
   fluid Cx.  Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, also has B glucan positive
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL today
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   - As per ID recs, will defer initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   (Vanc + Meropenem) in the setting of c. diff infection.  Will initiate
   for worsening ventilatory status, drop in BP.
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2-3 liters negative today
   - Will discuss with renal team the endpoint for CVVH
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:
   - continue insulin gtt protocol + continuous dextrose infusion in TPN
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          Meropenem discontinued
   -          f/u stool O&P
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: negative 2-3 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis presumed to be caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), metabolic acidosis, eosinophilia, and fluid overload.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, flagyl, caspofungin, insulin, norepinephrine, cisatracurium, midazolam, potassium chloride, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, and famotidine. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the C. diff infection, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, thrombotic events due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and continued fluid overload.

Further diagnostic tests and consultations are planned, including a diagnostic mini-balloon aspiration (BAL) for respiratory cultures, testing for hepatitis C viral load, and monitoring for Clostridium difficile toxin. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing evaluation"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently receiving treatment for C. difficile infection, including vancomycin retention enemas and oral vancomycin via nasogastric tube, as well as IV metronidazole.

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe infection. She is being weaned off the ventilator, with a current FiO2 of 40%. The plan is to continue daily trials with paralytics off.

The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug-induced thrombocytopenia, or other causes. The platelet count is low, and there is evidence of bleeding from the oral-gastric tube. Platelet transfusion is planned, and the patient's HIT antibody status will be followed up.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, likely due to blood loss associated with mucosal oozing and possible DIC. She has received multiple blood transfusions to maintain her hemoglobin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG.   Patient had persistent
   severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have improved with
   initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal fluid Cx.
   Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, also has B glucan positive
   - d/c caspofungin if mycolytic cultures are negative for 7 days
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 40%
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have sepsis, presumed to be caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been treated with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and IV Flagyl for the C. diff infection. She also received caspofungin as empirical coverage for yeast in the urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Her thrombocytopenia is likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. She has received platelet transfusions and is being monitored closely.

The patient has anemia that is possibly due to mucosal oozing associated with DIC, as well as hemolysis labs showing low haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). She has received red blood cell transfusions and is being closely monitored for evidence of hemolysis.

The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) that is possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given her sepsis."

         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  Multiple BCx NTD, as is peritoneal
   fluid Cx.  Linezolid discontinued per ID given no gram +
s by culture.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - continue caspofungin as empiric coverage for yeast cultured from
   urine and BAL fluid, also has B glucan positive
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID
   - currently on pressors; will leave on board today in effort to remove
   fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL today
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   - As per ID recs, will defer initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   (Vanc + Meropenem) in the setting of c. diff infection.  Will initiate
   for worsening ventilatory status, drop in BP.
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2-3 liters negative today
   - Will discuss with renal team the endpoint for CVVH
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:
   - continue insulin gtt protocol + continuous dextrose infusion in TPN
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          Meropenem discontinued
   -          f/u stool O&P
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: negative 2-3 liters today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease presenting to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and eosinophilia.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, possibly due to a Clostridium difficile infection. She is receiving treatment with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and IV flagyl.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to ARDS. She requires mechanical ventilation and is undergoing recruitment maneuvers to improve lung function.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. She is being monitored for bleeding and receiving platelet transfusions as needed.

4. Anemia: The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells multiple times due to ongoing blood loss and hemolysis.

      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - d/c caspofungin, as 7-day course completed and mycolytic cultures
   negativ
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - currently on vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR and increased sputum production,
   concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL performed on [**2-24**] with negative gram stain;
   follow-up cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin, Meropenem empirically for VAP, pending culture
   data
   - trial of Pressure Control today in effort to wean paralytics
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represented a drop from baseline, but now improved
   back to baseline.  Patient has blood oozing from OGT, possibly
   consistent with DIC.   HIT antibody negative.  Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          daily fibrinogen
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with > 1
   liter urine x 3 sequential days.
   - cont CVVH for fluid status management now for goal negative 4 liters
   today
   - Per renal, will continue CVVH for additional 48 hours with goal for 4
   liters negative endpoint for CVVH
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:
   - continue insulin gtt protocol + continuous dextrose infusion in TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and a past inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare-up. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed to be caused by Clostridium difficile infection. She has been treated with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and intravenous (IV) metronidazole.

The patient also has respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there are worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray with increased sputum production, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Empirical coverage for VAP has been initiated with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug-induced thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS). Platelet transfusion has been ordered.

The patient has anemia, possibly related to mucosal bleeding and blood loss. Blood transfusions have been given, and hemolysis labs are being monitored.

Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected, possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (AT"

         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - d/c caspofungin, as 7-day course completed and mycolytic cultures
   negativ
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - currently on vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL performed on [**2-24**] with negative gram stain;
   follow-up cultures
   - daily trial with paralytics off
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   - As per ID recs, will defer initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   (Vanc + Meropenem) in the setting of c. diff infection.  Will initiate
   for worsening ventilatory status, drop in BP.
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represents a drop from baseline.  Patient has blood
   oozing from OGT, possibly consistent with DIC.   HIT 4T score of 3 (2
   points for >50% decrease in platelets, and 1 point for  fall occurring
   > 10 days following heparin exposure, as patient was on SC heparin as
   DVT prophylaxis during recent hospitalization from [**2-2**]
 [**2-11**]) confers
   low probability for HIT.  Furthermore, she has only received two doses
   of SC heparin during this hospitalization, both on [**2-13**].   Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT antibody (low probability)
   -          Transfuse 1 bag platelets today and check post-transfusion
   platelet count
   -          q 6 hour fibrinogens; transfuse cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP.
   - cont CVVH with goal 2-3 liters negative today
   - Will discuss with renal team the endpoint for CVVH
   - goal CVP 10-12
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:
   - continue insulin gtt protocol + continuous dextrose infusion in TPN
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has been started on vancomycin, miniBAL sent, and GS neg for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Allergies are listed for various medications including aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, cefprozil, ibuprofen, erythromycin, and motrin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 80 bpm (normal range 70-96 bpm), blood pressure of 92/43 mmHg (normal range 92/43-107/51 mmHg), respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (normal range 24-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 10,230 mL and output of 12,876 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,646 mL. The patient is receiving various infusions including vasopressin, insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, potassium chloride, and calcium gluconate through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's lab results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 108 K"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
2. C. difficile infection (C. diff colitis)
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
4. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM)
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
6. Cocaine abuse
7. Acute renal failure (ARF)
8. Chronic viral hepatitis
9. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction
10. Pneumonia

The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and requires aggressive fluid removal, continuous insulin infusion for glycemic control, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and various other interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory function due to ARDS.
2. Progression of renal failure.
3. Development of additional infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. They are currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of cocaine abuse, diabetes mellitus type I, acute renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. They also have thrombocytopenia, Clostridium difficile infection, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance shows significant input and output imbalances. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient requires aggressive fluid removal, continued insulin infusion for glycemic control, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). They are also at risk for venous thromboembolism (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Nosocomial infection
3. Multiorgan failure
4. Hemodynamic instability
5. Renal replacement therapy
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
7. Stress ulcers
8. Complications related to diabetes mellitus type I
9. Complications related to chronic viral hepatitis
10. Further deterioration in respiratory status"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note indicates several significant events that occurred within a 24-hour period. These events include:

1. The patient tolerated being off sedation and paralytics most of the day.
2. PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) was decreased to 10.
3. Renal recessions were discussed, and CVVH (Continuous Venous-Venous Hemofiltration) removed 5 liters of fluid, with reassessment planned for the next day to potentially discontinue CVVH or transition to lasix.
4. Surgery recommendations were discussed with the family.
5. Antibiotics vancomycin and caspofungin were discontinued due to no growth in blood cultures.
6. The patient received Winrho for receiving Rh+ platelets the day before.
7. The patient became dyssynchronous with the vent at around 2 am. Adjusting pressure control or switching to CMV (cardiac output monitoring via pulmonary artery catheter) did not help, and increasing sedation also did not help. As a result, the patient was started on paralytics.

The patient has several allergies, including aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin (clarithromycin), levaquin (levofloxacin), cefzil (cefprozil), motrin (ibuprofen), and erythromycin base.

The last doses of antibiotics administered to the patient were caspofungin on [**2189-2-22**] at 02:11 PM, vancomycin on [**2189-2-24**] at 09:00 AM, meropenem on [**2189-2-24**] at 06:00 PM, and metronidazole on [**2189-2-25**] at 04:24 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions, including vasopressin, insulin, midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and cisatracurium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 37.2 C (98.9 F)
- Temperature (Tcurrent): 36.6 C (97.8 F)
- Heart rate (HR): 81 bpm (with normal range of 76-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure (BP): 119/49 mmHg (with normal range of 106/43-133/58 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 26 breaths per minute (with normal range of 20-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm (SR)

The patient's physical examination findings include being overweight/obese, normal eye/con"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, BAL, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - currently on vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR and increased sputum production,
   concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL performed on [**2-23**] with culture NGTD
   - d/c Vancomycin & Meropenem given negative BAL culture
   - discontinue paralytics
   - wean PEEP to 8, FiO2 40% as able
   - IP to perform bedside trach Friday
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia were suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represented a drop from baseline, but now improved
   back to baseline.  Patient has blood oozing from OGT, possibly
   consistent with DIC.   HIT antibody negative.  Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          daily fibrinogen
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with > 1
   liter urine x 4 sequential days.
   - cont CVVH today for fluid status management now for goal negative 5
   liters today
   - plan to d/c CVVH tomorrow and trial of Lasix
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # DM Type I:
   - transition insulin to TPN for continuous infusion
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          Meropenem discontinued
   -          recheck differential tomorrow
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection.
   - continue to trend transaminases
   - Liver consult team following
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: negative 5 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Famotidine in TPN as GI prophylaxis
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED on [**2-12**] & right PICC on [**2-20**].
   - A-line resided on [**2-24**]
   - R fem HD line to be discontinued later this week

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of CVID (Common Variable Immunodeficiency), HepC, Type 1 DM, and a distant history of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with presumed c. diff infection and is currently on vancomycin retention enemas, PO vancomycin via NGT, and IV flagyl. Surgical consult has been obtained for possible colonic resection if medical management fails. The patient's respiratory status has improved in the past with recruitment maneuvers, but there are now worsening infiltrates on CXR and increased sputum production, concerning for developing VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). Diagnostic mini BAL has been performed, and cultures are pending. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a low fibrinogen and elevated INR, which were suggestive of DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) in the setting of sepsis or underlying liver disease. HIT antibody negative, and drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a consideration. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions due to anemia and ongoing blood loss. 

The patient's renal function is improving, with an improving UOP (urine output). CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis) has been used for fluid status management. 

The patient has several other medical conditions"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - d/c caspofungin, as 7-day course completed and mycolytic cultures
   negativ
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - currently on vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR and increased sputum production,
   concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL performed on [**2-24**] with negative gram stain;
   follow-up cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin, Meropenem empirically for VAP, pending culture
   data
   - trial of Pressure Control today in effort to wean paralytics
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represented a drop from baseline, but now improved
   back to baseline.  Patient has blood oozing from OGT, possibly
   consistent with DIC.   HIT antibody negative.  Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          daily fibrinogen
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with > 1
   liter urine x 3 sequential days.
   - cont CVVH for fluid status management now for goal negative 4 liters
   today
   - Per renal, will continue CVVH for additional 48 hours with goal for 4
   liters negative endpoint for CVVH
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Multifactorial, secondary to DKA vs. sepsis vs.
   ARF.   Corrected with CVVH.
   - follow lactate, anion gap
   - cont CVVH per renal
   - cont insulin gtt, goal BG 80-120
   - q 12 hour lytes as per Renal
   # DM Type I:
   - continue insulin gtt protocol + continuous dextrose infusion in TPN
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          Meropenem discontinued
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection.
   - continue to trend transaminases
   - Liver consult team following
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: negative 4 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Famotidine in TPN as GI prophylaxis
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED on [**2-12**] & right PICC on [**2-20**].

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). She presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to a presumed Clostridium difficile infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and intravenous (IV) flagyl. Surgical consultation has been obtained for possible colonic resection if medical management fails. The patient's respiratory status has improved in the past with recruitment maneuvers but is now concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray and increased sputum production. Diagnostic mini-balloon (mini-BAL) has been performed, and cultures are pending. Empirical coverage for VAP has been initiated with vancomycin and meropenem. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and metabolic acidosis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated for fluid status management and ARF. The patient's liver disease is due to chronic hepatitis C infection. Other concerns include eosinophilia, which may be related to allergic reactions or intraabdominal infection, and the need for ongoing nutritional support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by C. Diff, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), diabetes mellitus type I, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatitis, and pneumonia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. Sepsis management: IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) every Saturday, vasopressin for fluid removal, and intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure management: decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 8, consulting interventional pulmonology for tracheostomy, and turning off paralytics.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): continuing with negative fluid balance and considering continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) holiday tomorrow.
4. Thrombocytopenia management: monitoring platelet count and bilirubin levels, ensuring hematocrit (Hct) is greater than 25.
5. Eosinophilia investigation: checking differential tomorrow.
6. Cirrhosis management: liver follow-up.
7. Diabetes management: continuing insulin infusion, considering subcutaneous insulin or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administration.

The patient also requires ICU care, including nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, glycemic control through insulin infusion,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), diabetes mellitus type I, cocaine abuse, and chronic viral hepatitis.

The patient has been receiving aggressive treatment including IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), vasopressin for fluid removal, and antibiotics for C. diff infection. Her respiratory failure due to ARDS is improving, as indicated by decreased PEEP and improved infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, she still requires mechanical ventilation and sedation.

Her renal function has improved, but she remains on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The coagulopathy is resolving, with increasing fibrinogen levels and decreasing platelet count. Eosinophilia is also being monitored.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type I is being managed with insulin infusions. Her cirrhosis is being followed closely, and she has a history of cocaine abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to ARDS - The patient's respiratory status should continue to improve, and efforts should be made to wean her off mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis secondary to C. diff colitis - Treatment for C."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, BAL, peritoneal fluid cultures
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - currently on vasopressin; will leave on board today in effort to
   remove fluid via CVVH
   # Respiratory failure:  Improved in the past with recruitment
   maneuvers.  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe infection.  Now with
   worsening infiltrates on CXR and increased sputum production,
   concerning for developing VAP.
   - diagnostic mini BAL performed on [**2-23**] with culture NGTD
   - d/c Vancomycin & Meropenem given negative BAL culture
   - discontinue paralytics
   - wean PEEP to 8, FiO2 40% as able
   - IP to perform bedside trach Friday
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia were suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen of ~100 represented a drop from baseline, but now improved
   back to baseline.  Patient has blood oozing from OGT, possibly
   consistent with DIC.   HIT antibody negative.  Drug-induced
   thrombocytopenia is also a consideration with possible offending agents
   including Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack
   of  microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
   -          Transfuse platelets > 50K if evidence of bleeding or drop in
   hct
   -          Maintain platelets > 20K if no evidence of active bleeding
   -          daily fibrinogen
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with > 1
   liter urine x 4 sequential days.
   - cont CVVH today for fluid status management now for goal negative 5
   liters today
   - plan to d/c CVVH tomorrow and trial of Lasix
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # DM Type I:
   - transition insulin to TPN for continuous infusion
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Eosinophilia:  Elevated Eos on diff.  ? allergic reaction to
   antibiotics vs. intraabdominal infection.  No apparent rash.
   -          Urine eos negative
   -          Meropenem discontinued
   -          recheck differential tomorrow
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection.
   - continue to trend transaminases
   - Liver consult team following
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Goal I/O: negative 5 liters today
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Famotidine in TPN as GI prophylaxis
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED on [**2-12**] & right PICC on [**2-20**].
   - A-line resided on [**2-24**]
   - R fem HD line to be discontinued later this week

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have sepsis presumed to be secondary to Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been treated with vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and intravenous metronidazole. She also has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and thrombocytopenia possibly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss from mucosal oozing and DIC. Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis. The patient's type 1 DM requires insulin therapy. There is an elevated eosinophil count, which could indicate an allergic reaction to antibiotics or intra-abdominal infection. The patient has chronic hepatitis C infection and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with plans for enteral nutrition in the future. She is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of allergies, including reactions to aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin, Levaquin, Cefzil, Motrin, erythromycin base, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), insulin, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, KCl (CRRT), and parenteral nutrition.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/51 to 139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen via an endotracheal tube. The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine, total bilirubin, lactate, D-dimer, and lactic acid. The patient's blood cultures are negative for bacteria, but there is an overgrowth of yeast and gram-positive cocci in the urine culture.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago, last
   flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH with worsening
   abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
    # Sepsis:  Presumed source is clostridium difficile infection in this
   patient with CVID, now s/p Xigris and IgG x 2 doses.   Patient had
   persistent severe metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate which have
   improved with initiation of CVVH.  All other micro data have been NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV
   flagyl for c. diff
   - Surgical consult following for ? colonic resection if patient fails
   to improve with medical management
   - appreciate ID recs
   - next dose IVIG as per ID recs
   - d/c Vasopressin today
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely ARDS in the setting of severe
   infection.
   - goal to wean PEEP to 5, FiO2 40% as able
   - IP to perform bedside trach Friday
   - esophageal balloon to remain in place
   # Thrombocytopenia:   Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and
   thrombocytopenia were suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs.
   underlying liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
   fibrinogen nadir at ~100 represented a drop from baseline.   HIT
   antibody negative.  Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a
   consideration with possible offending agents including Linezolid, PPI,
   Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack of  microangiopathic
   findings on the peripheral blood smear.  Platelet count now trending up
   > 100K.
   -          Hematology consult following
   # Anemia:  s/p 1 unit PRBC
s on [**2-13**] and 1 unit on [**2-16**] units on
   [**2-19**] unit on [**2-20**] (total 5 units for LOS).   Hemolysis labs  with
   low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no schistocytes are apparent on
   peripheral blood smear, making TTP unlikely.   Blood loss is possibly
   associated with mucosal oozing as above, given probable DIC.  Direct
   coombs antibody negative.
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 **], goal > 25-28
   - active T&S
   - Daily review of peripheral smear for evidence of hemolysis
   - Trend hemolysis labs (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin)
   - guaiac all stools
   # ARF:  Possibly secondary to ATN given sepsis.  Improving UOP with > 1
   liter urine x 4 sequential days.
   - d/c CVVH today
   - continue to trend urine output
   - renally dose medications
   # DM Type I:
   - continuous insulin in TPN + RISS q 6 hours
   - goal BG 80-120
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection.
   - continue to trend transaminases
   - Liver consult team following
   # FEN:
   -          Continue TPN as per Nutrition recs
   -          Initiate tube feeds at 10 mL/hour
   -          Goal I/O: net even off CVVH
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis.  VAP bundle.
   - Famotidine in TPN as GI prophylaxis
   # Access: Left IJ placed in ED on [**2-12**] & right PICC on [**2-20**].
   - A-line resited on [**2-24**]
   - d/c LIJ today after off vasopressin
   - R fem HD line to be discontinued after CVVH terminated

   Disposition:  ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and cirrhosis. She has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, immunoglobulin therapy, hemodialysis, and nutritional support. The patient remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications if weaning from mechanical ventilation is unsuccessful.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering her history of DIC and potential use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss and hemolysis may worsen her anemia, leading to fatigue, hypoxia, and further complications.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not adequately managed.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver disease may continue to progress, leading to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.

The patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications require careful monitoring and management in the ICU."

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow, reviewed and
   agree with the assessment and plan as above with emphasis and
   modification as follows:
   Patient with cirrhosis who developed severe septic shock presumably
   secondary to C. dificile colitis.  Patient was on 3 vasopressors at one
   point and developed renal failure requiring CVVH.
   Now off vasopression overnight
   On exam, T 98.7   P 96   BP 106/40   Sat 100% (PEEP 8, Fio2 of 0.4)

   2)       Septic Shock secondary to C. dif colitis - improving
   3)       Acute Renal Failure
   4)       Coagulopathy
 DIC/liver failure
   P:

 Trach planned for tomorrow
   2-  Discontinue sedation
   3 -  Repeat abd. CT today
 will consider trophic feeding after
   complete
   4-  Continue therapy for c. diff colitis (vanc/flagyl, ivig)
   5-  Plan to discontinue CVVH today
   Addendum: In the late afternoon/early evening, patient begin to develop
   tachycardia, low grade temperature spikes, and relative lower [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 and FiO2 of 40%. They have coarse breath sounds in the chest and their respiratory rate is within normal limits. ARDS is a known complication of severe sepsis and can lead to acute respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis secondary to C. difficile colitis: The patient has been treated with vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. difficile infection, which has likely led to severe sepsis. Signs of sepsis include tachycardia, low-grade temperature spikes, and hypotension.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). CVVH has been turned off, and the goal is negative fluid balance.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it has since resolved.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DM1): The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with insulin for glycemic control.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count.

7. Cirrhosis: The patient's"

   CT head [**2-26**]:
   There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally
   midline structures or edema. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
   preserved.
   The ventricles, basal cisterns, and sulci are normal in size and
   configuration.
   Opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterlly, fluid level with
   aerosolized secretions within the left sphenoid sinus, and mild mucosal
   thickening of the right sphenoid sinus and aerosolized secretions are
   new in
   comparison to CT [**2189-2-12**]. Minimal mucosal thickening involvs the right
   maxillary sinus and multiple ethmoid air cells. Increased soft tissue
   density
   within the posterior nasopharynx is likely related to nasogastric tube.
   No fracture or lesions suspicious for malignancy is identified.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
   2. Fluid and aerosolized secretions within the sphenoid sinuses. New
   opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.
   Please correlate clinically for signs and symptoms of sinusitis.
   NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:
   While there is no overt edema, there is slightly decreased conspicuity
   of the
   cerebral sulci in the frontal and parietal lobes at the vertex compared
   to the
   prior OSH study which may be technical and related to pt. positioning
   versus
   early cerebrale dema. To corrleate clinically and closely followup
   based on
   the pt.'s condition.
   CT abdomen [**2-26**] (prelim report):
   Dense right lower lobe airspace consolidation. Smaller focus of left
   lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis. The focal ill-defined pulmonary
   opacities are incompletely evaluated. Moderate ascites, slightly
   increased in
   comparison to [**2189-2-12**]. Diffuse bowel wall thickening with
   relative
   sparing of the cecum consistent with colitis, and likely slightly
   improved in
   comparison to [**2189-2-12**]. Anasarca.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a medical history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, anemia, and possible acute tubular necrosis. She is also suffering from colitis, which appears to be improving, and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. The patient is receiving IV fluids, insulin, and blood transfusions as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial infection: The patient is at risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and multiple invasive lines.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's severe infection may lead to the development of ARDS, characterized by severe inflammation in the lungs.
3. Colonic resection: If the patient fails to improve with medical management, surgical consultation for possible colonic resection may be considered.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver disease and acute kidney injury, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to renal failure if not properly managed.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (D"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has a history of cardiac arrest, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, which can be signs of infection. The presence of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome also increases the risk of infections.

2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.

3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate renal dysfunction. This may be due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys during septic shock or direct injury from the infection.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated D-dimer level suggests a hypercoagulable state, which increases the risk of blood clots. This could potentially lead to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving parenteral nutrition, but his nutritional status may still be compromised. Malnutrition can delay recovery and increase the risk of complications.

6. Pressure injuries: The patient is unable to stand, which puts him at risk"

   CVVH stopped. Fentanyl/Versed discontinued for daily wakeup, no
   purposeful movement. CT abd and head performed. Started developing a
   temp 101 rectal. MAP dropped to 50s. HR in 120s. Pancultured. New CVL
   placed and all lines pulled. Given one time bolus of versed and
   fentanyl with no effect on HR. Given vanco 1g IV X1 for possibility of
   line infection. Also given a dose of dapto and meropenem given new
   sepsis. TPN held for concern of infection, insulin gtt restarted. Hct
   dropped from 32 to 27. Started protonix [**Hospital1 **]. CVP is now 6. Given more
   IVF. Developed vent dysynchrony and fentanyl/versed restarted. Gotten
   4U FFP and DDAVP for trach today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is critically ill and has been experiencing recurrent sepsis, which may be due to a possible line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or persistent colitis.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure (ARF). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been stopped, and the patient is now oliguric due to recurrent sepsis. Renal dose medications are being administered.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM1/DKA) and requires continuous insulin infusion. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) has been held.
- The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is undergoing mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy was performed today.
- The patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it has resolved. The platelet count will be monitored.
- The patient is anemic, with a decreasing hemoglobin concentration. A central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10 is recommended, and hct (hematocrit) will be trended every 8 hours.
- The patient has been started on trophic total parenteral nutrition (TF) via the tracheostomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow.  I have reviewed
   and agree with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis and modifications:
   Patient with cirrhosis who developed severe septic shock presumably
   secondary to C. dificile colitis.  Patient was on 3 vasopressors at one
   point and developed renal failure requiring CVVH and also with severe
   ARDS.  Most recently has been off vasopressors and weaning from
   ventilator.
   Late afternoon yesterday, she developed fevers, tachycardia, decreased
   urine op, hypotension.  In response to this, all of her old lines were
   removed and a right IJ was placed.  She was placed on broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.

   2)       Septic Shock secondary to C. dif colitis
 improving
   3)       Fever (recurrent sepsis)
 likely secondary to line infection
   as improved after changed although may be pneumonia or other source as
   well
 cultures pending and on broad-spectrum antibiotics
   4)       Acute Renal Failure

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Recurrent sepsis: The patient has shown signs of recurrent infection, with fevers, tachycardia, and decreased urine output. There is a concern for possible line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or persistent colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung injury leading to impaired gas exchange. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy placement has been planned, and the plan is to wean off sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing after the tracheostomy.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypoperfusion. The patient's urine output has decreased, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated. The plan is to discontinue CVVH today.

4. Coagulopathy/DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, possibly due to liver failure and sepsis. Platelet count is low, and there is a concern for ongoing bleeding.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing,"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient received 4 units of FFP and DDAVP prior to trach
   - Underwent trach
   - Her daptomycin was switched to vancomycin per ID recs for better
   penetration to the lungs, continued on meropenem
   - ID did not address IVIG dose
   - Her TPN was held for 24 hours while the blood cultures were pending
   - Patient was started on PPI and famotidine in TF to be discontinued
   - Patient was ordered afrin and nasal saline given ? sinusitis
   - CXR post trach looks like pulmonary edema (patient was hypertensive
   during the procedure), received IV lasix 20 in the afternoon, and 40 in

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of c. diff sepsis. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 143 K/uL. Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated D-dimer.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. She has developed nosocomial infections, as indicated by fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of infection could be a pulmonary infection or a line infection. All central lines have been discontinued and tips sent for culture.

She also has c. diff colitis, which appears to be improving with medical management. Surgical consult has been requested for potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old individual with a medical history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. They presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, pulmonary edema, and other complications. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output, which are suspicious for a nosocomial infection. The source of the infection could be a pulmonary infection or a line infection. Cultures have been sent for analysis.
2. C. diff Sepsis: The patient has C. diff colitis and sepsis. They are being treated with Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, and IV Flagyl. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible colonic resection if the patient does not improve with medical management.
3. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely experienced flash pulmonary edema after aggressive fluid resuscitation for hypotension and hypertension periprocedure for tracheostomy. Diuresis has been initiated to manage the pulmonary edema.
4. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient may have developed ARDS due to severe infection. Tracheostomy was performed, and the goal is to wean PEEP to 5 and FiO2 to 40% as able.
5. Decreased GI Movement: The patient has decreased gastrointestinal movement with significant tube feed residuals at a low rate. This could be due to ileus or bowel death. Surgical consultation has been requested.
6. Anemia: The patient has received multiple blood transfusions due to anemia. Hematocrit levels need to be monitored.
7. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, which may be multifactorial. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
8. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may have ARF, possibly secondary to Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) given the sepsis. CVVH has been discontinued, and urine output needs to be closely monitored.
9. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately.
10. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic HCV infection leading to cirrhosis. Liver function tests and consult with the liver team are recommended.
11. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots.
12. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Bundle: The patient is undergoing VAP bundle interventions to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old with common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, line infection due to enterococcus, and respiratory failure likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient received treatment for C. diff sepsis, including Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, and IV Flagyl. The patient also received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and pressure support for respiratory failure. Anemia and hyperbilirubinemia were noted, which could be attributed to hemolysis, liver disease, acute illness, and underlying conditions. The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic hepatitis C infection. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to failed enteral feeding. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile sepsis: The patient initially presented with C. difficile sepsis, which required aggressive treatment including Vancomycin retention enemas, PO Vancomycin via NGT, and IV Flagyl. Continued vigilance is necessary to prevent recurrence or worsening of C. difficile infection.

2. Line infection: The patient had a"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and was treated with Xigris and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). He also had a line infection caused by Enterococcus species, for which he received daptomycin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure likely secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe infection. He underwent tracheostomy placement on 2/27. His recent blood cultures have shown no growth. The patient has anemia and evidence of hemolysis with bloody secretions from the nasogastric tube. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) has been resolved. His liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. He developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) while in the hospital. The patient has a history of chronic Hepatitis C infection. He is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and insulin for glycemic control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), hepatitis C (HepC), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis. He has since developed multiple complications including line infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and liver disease. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, vasopressin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He is also on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to CVID, making him more susceptible to infections. There is a risk of developing further infections, especially if proper infection control measures are not followed.
2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, which can lead to significant respiratory distress and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation. This condition can also result in acute lung injury and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters and timely intervention are necessary to prevent complications related to renal failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has evidence of hemolysis and bloody secretions from the nasogastric tube. Continued monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate management are"

- The patient's condition has shown improvement, but there are still concerns regarding sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), potential true line infection with enterococcus, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1)/diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and feeding intolerance.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a sinus rhythm, normal blood pressure, and adequate oxygenation.
- The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
- The patient's ABG results show normal oxygenation and ventilation.
- The patient's laboratory values indicate acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of possible hemolysis.
- The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, insulin for glycemic control, and has a multi-lumen central line.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.
- The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection and presence of central lines.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status should be"

   emphasis and modifications:
   Patient with cirrhosis who developed severe septic shock presumably
   secondary to C. dificile colitis.  Patient was on 3 vasopressors at one
   point and developed renal failure requiring CVVH and also with severe
   ARDS.  Most recently has been off vasopressors and weaning from
   ventilator.
   Late afternoon yesterday, she developed fevers, tachycardia, decreased
   urine op, hypotension.  In response to this, all of her old lines were
   removed and a right IJ was placed.  She was placed on broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. The patient's fever, tachycardia, decreased urine output, and hypotension are indicative of sepsis.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a serious lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. The patient's symptoms of tachypnea, decreased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of ARDS.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is characterized by the sudden loss of kidney function. This can be indicated by the elevated levels of creatinine and BUN, as well as the need for dialysis.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient is experiencing coagulation problems, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver failure. This can be inferred from the low platelet count and elevated D-dimer levels.

5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has high bilirubin levels, which could be due to partial hemolysis and hepatic dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as indicated by the need"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of viral hepatitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and common variable immunodeficiency presenting with c. diff sepsis, line infection, respiratory failure, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, DKA, cirrhosis, and failed enteral nutrition. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, has an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and a nasogastric tube in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Infection at the site of arterial or central venous catheters.
4. Further deterioration of liver function and development of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and sepsis.
5. Persistent anemia and need for blood transfusions.
6. Development of new renal complications or exacerbation of pre-existing renal issues.
7. Continued difficulty with weaning off mechanical ventilation and potential need for tracheostomy.
8. Potential relapse of Clostridium difficile infection.
9. Progression of diabetes mellitus due to stress of illness and corticosteroid use.
10. Development of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic viral hepatitis (VID), hepatitis C (HepC), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cirrhosis. The patient was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and line infection. He has undergone several interventions including hemodialysis catheter removal, administration of daptomycin, vancomycin, and flagyl for C. diff, as well as IV immunoglobulin (IVIG).

The patient also has respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on pressure support ventilation. He has received Lasix for pulmonary edema and is being weaned off pressure support. Anemia was treated with packed red blood cell transfusion (PRBC).

The patient has evidence of hemolysis, bloody secretions from the nasogastric tube, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that has since resolved. Hyperbilirubinemia is likely multifactorial and is being monitored.

The patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is on insulin therapy. He has chronic hepatitis C infection and is being evaluated by the liver consult team.

Nutritionally, the patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and is being re-challenged with trophic feeds (TF).

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of aspirin allergy, penicillin allergy, and sulfonamide allergy. The patient is on various medications including lasix, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. They are currently weaned to a partial support (PS) of 12 and have been given lasix overnight. Trophic tube feeding has been stopped due to high residuals.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/55mmHg to 94/40mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 369mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 168, and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is 253.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are awake and following simple commands, have a tracheostomy tube in place, and exhibit crackles in the lungs. There is also evidence of bilateral lower extremity"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and common variable immunodeficiency presenting with Clostridium difficile sepsis. The patient has been treated with daptomycin for line infection, vancomycin retention enemas, oral vancomycin, and metronidazole for C. diff sepsis. He has also received Xigris and IVIG. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS in the setting of severe infection, and he has been placed on pressure support. 

The patient has anemia and has received 7 units of packed red blood cells for low hemoglobin levels. There is evidence of hemolysis (Coomb's negative) and bloody secretions from the nasogastric tube. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has resolved.

The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, which is likely multifactorial from underlying liver disease, acute illness, and hemolysis. There is no biliary ductal dilatation on CT scan.

The patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) while in the hospital, so insulin is being continued in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and titrated.

The patient has chronic hepatitis C infection and is being evaluated by the liver consult team.

The patient is tolerating tube feeding and continuing with TPN with insulin. Prophylactic measures include pneumatic boots"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The 24-hour events include giving IV Reglan, tolerating tube feeding at 10 mL/hr with only 30-40cc residuals, negative C.diff A/B x 1, increased insulin in TPN, transitioning to bolus sedation for Versed, and discussing potential discharge to respiratory rehab. The patient may need to be off all sedation prior to discharge. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of -500cc for the day, and a PICC line order has been placed.

The patient has several allergies, including aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin (oral), Levaquin (oral), Cefzil (oral), Motrin (oral), and erythromycin base. The last doses of antibiotics given were daptomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions and medications, including fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), and midazolam (Versed). Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and ABG results.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, Hepatitis C, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, who is currently admitted to the ICU due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, line infection, respiratory failure, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's recent medical interventions include tracheostomy, central venous catheter removal, administration of daptomycin, Xigris, and IVIG, placement of a pressure support device, and blood transfusion. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, furosemide, midazolam, and insulin in TPN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has a history of line infection, and there is still growth of Enterococcus on the removed catheter tip. The patient is on day #6 of a 7-day course of daptomycin for the line infection. Surveillance cultures should be monitored, and further evaluation may be required.
2. C. diff sepsis: The patient has improved from C. diff sepsis, and current treatment includes continued PO vancomycin via NGT, IV flagyl, and weekly IVIG as per ID recommendations.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe infection. The patient is on pressure support and the goal"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow.  I have reviewed
   and agree with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis and modifications:
   Patient with cirrhosis who developed severe septic shock presumably
   secondary to C. dificile colitis.  Patient was on 3 vasopressors at one
   point and developed renal failure requiring CVVH and also with severe
   ARDS.  Most recently has been off vasopressors and weaning from
   ventilator.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to ARDS/pneumonia: The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation. There is improvement noted, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure proper oxygenation and weaning from the ventilator.

2. Abdominal tenderness/not tolerating trophic feedings: The patient is experiencing abdominal tenderness and has difficulty tolerating even trophic feedings. This could indicate ongoing issues with the gastrointestinal system or potential underlying ischemia. Further evaluation and discussion with surgery are recommended.

3. Septic Shock secondary to C. diff colitis: The patient has had an episode of septic shock likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. Treatment with vancomycin and metronidazole has been initiated, and the patient is showing improvement.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be related to septic shock and other factors. Renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate management strategies such as dialysis may be required.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient exhibits signs of coagulopathy, which could be secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver failure. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and appropriate management,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, anemia, liver dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and weakness. The patient is receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluids, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and medications for infection and other complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Infection: The patient has an infection caused by Enterococcus on their hospital line and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) sepsis. Proper antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be implemented to prevent further infections.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure, which requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has liver dysfunction, which may affect coagulation and metabolism. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation profile is necessary.
5. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and careful management of blood glucose levels is important to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hypoglycemia.
6. Weakness and Muscle Wasting: The patient is weak and has severe muscle wasting. Physical"

The patient's anemia has been addressed with a blood transfusion, and his hyperbilirubinemia is likely multifactorial. His diabetes is being managed with insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Line infection: The patient has a history of line infection, which has been treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of developing another line infection due to the presence of multiple lines.

2. C. diff colitis: The patient had C. diff sepsis, and although his colitis appears improved, there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms.

3. ARDS: The patient is likely suffering from ARDS, a severe form of lung injury characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure. Complications associated with ARDS include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.

4. Liver failure: The patient has chronic Hepatitis C and cirrhosis, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions and allergies. He is sedated and unable to provide any history. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including the placement of a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. He is receiving TPN with lipids, and his glycemic control is being monitored. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown signs of metabolic alkalosis, which was treated by giving back 500cc. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The risk of developing VAP should be closely monitored, especially considering the patient's current antibiotic regimen.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with boots is mentioned, but further assessment and monitoring are necessary.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is being provided.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's initial metabolic alkalosis may recur if there is ongoing bicarbonate loss or other underlying causes. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He presented with sepsis secondary to C. diff colitis and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has been receiving treatment for line infection with daptomycin and is now on day 6 of a 7-day course. He also received Xigris and IVIG for C. diff sepsis. The patient's colitis appears improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen, and he has discontinued vancomycin retention enemas.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure, likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), secondary to severe infection. He underwent tracheostomy placement on [**2-27**] and is currently on pressure support.

The patient experienced anemia, likely due to hemolysis, and received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His condition has stabilized, and his hematocrit (Hct) is being monitored daily.

The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia, which is likely multifactorial, including underlying liver disease, acute illness, and contribution from hemolysis. No biliary ductal dilatation was noted on recent CT scan.

Additionally, the patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) while in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient had a line infection caused by Enterococcus, which was treated with daptomycin. He received Xigris and IVIG for C. diff sepsis and is currently being treated with oral vancomycin via nasogastric tube, IV metronidazole, and weekly IVIG as per infectious disease recommendations. The patient also has anemia, likely due to hemolysis, and is being transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) as needed. He has hyperbilirubinemia, which is multifactorial, and his bilirubin levels remain high but stable. The patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) while in the hospital and is receiving insulin through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He has chronic hepatitis C infection and is being monitored by the liver consult team. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding (TF) and TPN with lipids. His glycemic control is managed with insulin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient had a line infection caused by Enterococcus. This highlights the importance of proper line management and surveillance to prevent such infections.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several ongoing medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The vital signs indicate a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask with FiO2 40%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 268. The ABG results show pH 7.55, PaCO2 33 mmHg, and HCO3- 107 mEq/L, indicating respiratory alkalosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The ABG results also indicate a high HCO3- level of 107 mEq/L, suggesting metabolic alkalosis. The cause of this condition is likely due to the diuresis of 1.7L last night.

3. Sepsis/C. Difficile: The patient is still experiencing abdominal pain and has a history of C. difficile infection. The CT abdomen looks okay, but a final read is pending. The patient's blood cultures from 03/04/2189 show growth of Daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus species. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of sepsis or recurrence of C. difficile infection.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cirrhosis who has developed severe septic shock, likely secondary to C. difficile colitis. The patient required multiple vasopressors and developed renal failure, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient also suffered from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition is improving, as they are off vasopressors and being weaned from the ventilator. However, the patient still faces several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure secondary to ARDS/pneumonia, colitis, septic shock secondary to C. difficile colitis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy (DIC/liver failure), and alkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to ARDS and pneumonia. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation status will be necessary.

2. Colitis: Although the patient's colitis is improving, there is still a risk of complications such as infection recurrence or worsening abdominal pain.

3. Septic Shock: Despite the improvement in the patient's condition, there is still a risk of septic shock recurrence due to the underlying infection and compromised immune system.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are currently failing, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid accumulation, and other complications related to renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hepatitis C (HCV), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, line infection, and respiratory failure likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, central venous catheter removal, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolysis: The patient has evidence of hemolysis as indicated by negative Coombs test and bloody secretions from the NG tube. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as necessary is recommended.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Although resolved, the patient had evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and clotting complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and active bleeding control measures are important.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's chronic liver disease and high bilirubin levels may predispose him to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring of mental status and liver function is essential.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient developed DKA while in the hospital. Tight glycemic control with insulin and close monitoring of blood glucose levels are crucial.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 157/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on the ventilator.

The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and Vivonex, a full nutritional supplement. Her pain is being managed with dilaudid and fentanyl patches. She has an arterial line, PICC line, and urinary catheter in place. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, so prophylactic measures such as boots and a histamine-2 blocker are being implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being considered for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who presented with severe septic shock secondary to C. difficile colitis. The patient required three vasopressors at one point and developed renal failure, requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient also developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was placed on invasive ventilation. Currently, the patient is weaning off the ventilator and has been off vasopressors. The patient's condition has been improving, with improvement in ARDS, septic shock, and renal failure. However, the patient still has low-grade fever, coagulopathy (DIC/liver failure), and alkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to ARDS/pneumonia: The patient was on invasive ventilation due to severe ARDS. There is a potential complication of respiratory failure if the patient does not continue to improve and wean off the ventilator successfully.
2. Low-grade fever: The presence of low-grade fever indicates an ongoing inflammatory process in the body. This could be a sign of ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. Septic Shock secondary to C. diff colitis: Although the patient's condition is improving, there is still a risk of septic shock recurrence if the infection is not completely eradicated.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously developed acute renal failure, which has improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe lung condition often associated with infections. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which may be a result of the sepsis caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has undergone treatment for C. diff sepsis, including the administration of Xigris and IVIG. His colitis appears improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen.

Additionally, the patient has a history of common viral inclusion disease (VID), liver cirrhosis, and hepatitis C. His liver function tests are abnormal, and he has developed hyperbilirubinemia. He is also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during his hospital stay.

The patient's pain management is still a concern as he continues to experience pain that is difficult to control. He has been started on a fentanyl patch and continues to receive pain medication as needed.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include anemia, which is considered stable, and the need for further evaluation and management of the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including common variable immunodeficiency (VID), hepatitis C (HepC), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and had an infected central venous catheter, which was removed and showed growth of Enterococcus. The patient has been treated with daptomycin, Xigris, and IVIG for sepsis, and her colitis appears improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen. She is currently on PO Vancomycin and Flagyl for C. diff, and will continue to receive these medications for an additional 14 days post-completion of daptomycin treatment due to the severity of her illness.

The patient also has respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe infection. She underwent tracheostomy placement on [**2-27**] and is now on a tracheostomy tube with mechanical ventilation. A speech and swallow consultation was recommended for a passy-muir valve, but it has not yet been performed.

The patient continues to experience pain that is difficult to control, and pain management strategies include starting a fentanyl patch and administering PRN dilaudid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, Hepatitis C, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after undergoing a tracheostomy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been febrile with a recent spike in temperature. He has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired arousal and attention, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration and gas exchange, and impaired ventilation. The patient also has renal failure, altered nutrition, and acute liver injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Measures such as the VAP bundle should be continued to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic boots should be used to prevent DVT.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and acute liver injury put him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring of mental status and neurologic function should be performed regularly.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic illnesses and recent antibiotic use. Broad-s"

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and other complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and signs of liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin. The patient also has impaired renal function with elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as line infection, C. diff sepsis, ARDS, and renal failure. They have started the patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications to address these conditions.

The patient's pain management is a concern as she is still experiencing pain that is difficult to control. The medical team has initiated fentanyl patch and PRN dilaudid for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Fever: The patient experienced a spike in temperature on [**2189-3-7**] afternoon, which was confirmed through pan-culture. The fever was initially attributed to an infection but may have other causes as well.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's respiratory status is impaired, with decreased oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is also diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

4. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving tube feeds (TF) through a nasogastric (NG) tube. The flow rate and volume of the feeds have been adjusted based on the patient's condition.

5. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 3,306 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,635 mL through urine. The patient's weight has decreased from 64 kg at admission to 59.9 kg currently.

6. Medications: The patient has received various antibiotics including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Daptomycin. Other medications such"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. His temperature is 103.5°F and his lactate levels are rising. He has been started on meropenem and daptomycin for his infection. His residuals have increased, so tube feeds have been held due to gastrograffin intolerance. He is also experiencing discomfort and respiratory distress, which has led to re-sedation with versed and the reintroduction of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's INR has been increasing from 2.3 to 2.8 to 2.9, indicating a coagulation disorder. His liver function tests (LFTs) are also trending upwards. A CT abdomen/pelvis reveals generalized anasarca with marked soft tissue edema, ascites, and bowel wall thickening, suggesting third spacing. There are diffuse bilateral ground-glass and patchy pulmonary opacities, which could reflect edema and/or infection. A CT sinus is deferred due to patient instability.

The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin, Levaquin, Cefzil, Motrin, and erythromycin base. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 03/07, metronidazole on 03/07, daptomycin on 03/08, and mer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis and respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since March 8th. He has had multiple fever spikes, rising lactate levels, and increased residuals. He is unable to tolerate tube feeds and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's condition is complicated by line infections, including a central line tip culture growing Enterococcus species. He also has anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased oxygen requirement and lack of new secretions raise concerns for VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of chronic hepatitis C and elevated bilirubin levels indicate potential liver dysfunction.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient developed DKA while in the ICU, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
5. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient's recent history of CDI should be considered in the management of his gastrointestinal symptoms.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common viral inclusion disease (CID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile sepsis and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after undergoing a tracheostomy. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, and his lactate levels have been rising. He has been on various antibiotics, including Daptomycin, Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Flagyl. He also received IVIG and Xigris for Clostridium difficile sepsis. The patient's condition has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation and has ongoing pain management issues.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with Clostridium difficile sepsis indicates a severe infection. There is a potential for further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
2. ARDS: The patient's development of ARDS after the tracheostomy suggests possible lung damage. This can lead to respiratory failure and require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Line infection: The presence of Enterococcus in the catheter tip suggests a possible line infection. This can be a serious complication if the infection spreads to the bloodstream.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient has chronic HCV infection and hyperbilirubinemia, which may indicate liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis admitted to the ICU. She presented with Clostridium difficile colitis, septic shock, and multiorgan failure. Initially, there was improvement; however, she now shows signs of new infection, including fevers, leukocytosis, worsening liver function tests, high lactate levels, and respiratory failure. She has been placed back on ventilator support. The suspected sources of infection are the lung and digestive tract. Cultures have been obtained, and a bronchoscopy will be performed today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or persistent bowel sepsis. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. The plan includes obtaining cultures, performing serial lavages and cell count, and reducing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 14 while checking arterial blood gas (ABG).
2. Sepsis: The patient is at high risk for fungemia. Coverage with fluconazole should be initiated, and fungal cultures should be sent. The current antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, meropenem, and Flagyl.
3. Anemia: The patient may have autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and DIC labs should be checked.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels may be due to hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and suspected sepsis. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the weekend, with high fevers, rising lactate levels, increased pulmonary infiltrates on CT scan, and bowel wall thickening. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving multiple medications including meropenem, daptomycin, midazolam, furosemide, and hydromorphone. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, and certain antibiotics. Vital signs show a temperature of 103.5°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/52-138/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube with mechanical ventilation mode set to MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume of 380 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174. Physical examination reveals diffuse bronchial breath sounds, wheezing, and bilateral peripheral edema. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and there is evidence of renal dysfunction. The assessment and plan include hypoglycemia, fever, acute respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bowel sepsis. The patient is at high risk for fungemia and requires coverage with fluconazole. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned to manage the patient's complex medical conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (VID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. Currently, he is experiencing oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, fever, and respiratory failure. There are multiple comorbidities and complications, including line infection, cirrhosis, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, DKA, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile with new oxygen requirements and GNRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), suggesting a possible source of infection in the lungs.
2. Line infection: The patient had a central venous catheter tip growing Enterococcus, but no growth from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Daptomycin was completed, and follow-up blood cultures are pending.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis: The patient has been treated with Xigris and IVIG. Colitis appears improved on serial CT scans, and he is afebrile. Vancomycin retention enemas have been discontinued, and PO Vancomycin and IV Flag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and chronic HCV infection. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure after undergoing a tracheostomy. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a new fever, increased oxygen requirement, and GNRs in BAL, suggesting that the lungs may be the source of infection. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a concern.
2. Line infection: The patient had a removed HD catheter with catheter tip growing Enterococcus. Blood cultures from the NGTD did not show any growth. Daptomycin course was completed, but the line needs to be evaluated further.
3. C. difficile sepsis: The patient had colitis that appears improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen. He was treated with Xigris and IVIG. PO Vancomycin via NGT and IV Flagyl will be continued.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient seems to have a new pneumonia and is back on mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is trending down, stabilized, and negative DIC labs. Transfusion for HCT <21 may be necessary.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia:"

   [**3-8**] CT sinuses: Opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells,
   fluid in the
   left sphenoid sinus, and diffuse mucosal thickening in the remainder of
   the paranasal sinuses. Based on imaging findings, it is impossible to
   determine whether this fluid is infected.

- The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/47-130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.1 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine, BUN).
- Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and scattered consolidation likely representing pulmonary edema superimposed on pneumonia, as well as moderate ascites and diffuse anasarca.
- The patient has a history of allergies to various medications, including aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, and clarithromycin.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple IV medications, including daptomycin, micafung"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female who has been recovering from severe sepsis due to C.diff colitis with multi-organ failure. She initially showed improvement but has recently experienced recurrent sepsis, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is stable with resolution of fevers and improved chest X-ray after the addition of meropenem and micafungin. The source of infection is suspected to be the lungs with a potential Gram-negative rod (GNR) infection, as indicated by bronchoscopic aspirate culture results.

The patient remains critically ill with ongoing respiratory failure. Physical examination reveals comfort and sedation, tracheostomy in place, bilateral rhonchi in the lungs, regular heart rate, mildly distended abdomen, and 2-3+ edema in the extremities. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis, new GNR PNA: The patient has developed a new infection with a GNR organism, leading to sepsis. Treatment involves vancomycin, IV flagyl, and oral vancomycin, with improvement noted after initiating this regimen.

2. Line infection: The patient had a line infection that was treated with daptomycin. A new central venous line has been placed, and two bags of fresh frozen plasma ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), who presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is producing minimal urine output.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are low.
3. Fever: The patient has a new fever, which could be indicative of an infection.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, necessitating the return to mechanical ventilation.
5. Impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation: The patient's overall respiratory function and physiological responses are compromised.
6. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the inability to tolerate oral intake.
7. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially developed ARDS secondary to C. diff sepsis and now exhibits signs of a new pulmonary infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (VID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis due to chronic Hepatitis C infection, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and Type 1 DM with recent development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He also has a history of multiple line infections, including a central venous catheter tip growing Enterococcus and a peripheral IV line infection with GNRs. The patient's current conditions include oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, fever, respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, altered arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, and alteration in nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile with new oxygen requirements and GNRs in BAL, indicating a likely source of infection in the lungs, which could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Line infection: The patient had a central venous catheter tip growing Enterococcus and a peripheral IV line infection with GNRs.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) seps"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of ARDS and impaired gas exchange, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not appropriately managed. There is also a risk of fluid overload due to inadequate urine output.
3. Hepatic Complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and jaundice suggest possible hepatic dysfunction. There is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy if not managed properly.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to MODS makes him susceptible to various infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or pulmonary infections.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and potential fluid overload can lead to cardiovascular complications such as congestive heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition indicate a risk of neurological complications such as delirium or seizures"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a medical history of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. He presented with c. diff sepsis and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has been diagnosed with line infection, specifically Enterococcus from a central venous catheter, and is being treated with daptomycin. Additionally, he has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis, for which he has been receiving oral vancomycin and metronidazole.

The patient's current condition includes oliguria/anuria (low urine output), hypoglycemia, fever, respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, alteration in nutrition, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels indicating renal impairment, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral opacification of the lung fields consistent with ARDS.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), discontinuation of fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV, continuation of pain management with fentanyl and versed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who is critically ill. She has a history of colitis and sepsis, as well as acute respiratory failure. The patient's urine output was intermittently low but responded to fluids and albumin. There were no further fevers. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics were started, and the patient improved with Zosyn. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic regimen, discontinue vancomycin and micafungin, and wean PEEP on the ventilator. Sedation will also be lightened.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Possible new VAP - The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Clostridium difficile colitis/ileus - The patient is being treated for C. diff colitis with flagyl and vancomycin. If these treatments fail, the patient may develop complications such as ileus or toxic megacolon.
3. Respiratory failure - The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can worsen if ventilator settings are not optimized or if there is an underlying condition like ARDS.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF) - The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored as there are concerns about prerenal vs. intrinsic renal injury.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to various medications and has been on several antibiotics, including vancomycin and micafungin, which were discontinued. The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. They are also on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure of 150/74 mmHg, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate at 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid status. The patient has received a total of 2,714 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 913 mL given through intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 542 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 242, indicating adequate oxygenation. The patient's respiratory system is also producing crackles and diffuse breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.3 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 388 K/uL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 81-193 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output is low, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, requiring close monitoring and management.
4. Fever: The patient has a persistent low-grade fever, which may indicate an underlying infection.
5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with impaired ventilation and gas exchange.
6. Aerobic capacity/endurance: The patient's ability to perform physical activities is impaired due to critical illness.

   - appreciate ID recs
   - dose IVIG weekly as per ID recs; Q Saturday
   - senna / colace
 make PRN given loose stools
   - Surgery following, CT not concerning, will follow

   # Respiratory failure:  Developed PNA.  Back on vent for resp distress.
   - Continue vent for now but will try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning
   # Pain Management : Still having pain that is difficult to control.
   Discontinued Fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV [**3-9**].  Pain control has
   consistently been a difficult issue, some concern for hypersensitivity
   syndrome.
   - Fentanyl & versed gtt should be transitioned to bolus dosing
   dilaudid PRN
   - Pain consult today
   # Weakness: Likely ICU myopathy [**1-26**] prolonged illness, paralytics.

   overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here.
   - Now NPO again as gut not working well
   - TPN with insulin
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team following,
   nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (VID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, ARDS, and respiratory failure after undergoing tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, C. diff colitis, respiratory failure, pain management issues, weakness likely due to ICU myopathy, anemia, renal failure, Type 1 DM with DKA, cirrhosis, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient has undergone several interventions and consultations, including removal of a central venous catheter due to line infection, initiation of VAP bundle and DVT prophylaxis, and ongoing management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently febrile and has a suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with no growth from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This indicates a potential ongoing infection that needs to be addressed promptly.
2. C. diff sepsis: The patient's colitis appears improved, but he still requires ongoing treatment for C. diff infection, including continued PO Vancomycin and reinitiation of IV Flagyl.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed pneumonia and is back on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to transition him to a tracheostomy mask with only"

","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of rectal bleeding, penicillin allergy, and aseptic meningitis. The patient's recent events include discontinuation of vancomycin and micafungin as their BAL was negative, and they are now being considered for discontinuation of meropenum if the negative BAL continues for an additional 24 hours. The patient's TPN has been restarted with insulin. The patient's Hct levels have been trending between 26.1 and 28.3. The patient's PEEP has been successfully decreased to 5 cmH2O, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.4, PaCO2 of 33, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 75, and HCO3 of 18.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (normal range: 89-101 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 142/59 mmHg to 150/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute (normal range: 6-41 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight has decreased from 64 kg at admission to 59.9 kg currently. Their CVP is within normal range.

1. Sepsis: The source of sepsis is presumed to be Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). Vancomycin and micafungin were discontinued due to unrevealing cultures. The plan is to complete an 8-day total course of antibiotics.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has been weaned off ventilator support and is now on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)/Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). The plan is to continue weaning and transition to a tracheostomy collar as tolerated.
3. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is still receiving vancomycin and metronidazole. However, she continues to experience significant abdominal pain, and a gastrointestinal consult has been requested regarding the possibility of sigmoidoscopy to rule out dead bowel.
4. Acute renal failure: The cause of acute renal failure is uncertain, but it could be related to Aminoglycoside-induced Nephrotoxicity (AIN). Unnecessary antibiotics (vanc/mycof) have been discontinued, and efforts will be made"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, presenting with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile colitis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 505 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 11.8 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals icteric conjunctivae, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, bilateral extremity edema, and non-assessable skin and neurologic examination due to intubation. 

Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.6 thousand/mm3, elevated liver enzymes, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (VID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including hyperkalemia, sepsis, C. diff colitis, pain management, weakness, anemia, renal failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, line infection, and fluid electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further respiratory complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of sepsis, including C. diff sepsis and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent or new infections.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in his blood, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, leading to elevated creatinine levels. This increases the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of penicillin allergy, previous rectal bleeding, and multiple drug allergies. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient has received several medications including insulin, furosemide (Lasix), sodium bicarbonate, and hydromorphone. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. The patient's renal function is impaired with increased creatinine and BUN levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and a positive fluid balance of 1,729 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's physical examination reveals icteric conjunctivae, symmetric chest expansion, and rhonchi on lung auscultation. The patient's extremities show edema grade 3+. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

   Overnight she was attempted on trachmask, but did not tolerate
   secondary to tachypnea and acute respiratory acidosis (superimposed
   upon a metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure).  She was
   placed back on PSV 14/5 and Fio2 0.5 with improvement in her
   respiratory acidosis.
   Also, she developed worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her TPN
   was discontinued because it contained potassium; was therefor started
   on insulin gtt and dextrose because of history of DKA.  She remained
   hyperkalemic, and renal was consulted this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with multiple comorbidities and long ICU course complicated by
   cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP; now has worsening renal
   failure and hyperkalemia.
   1.       Renal Failure: Most immediate issue is her renal failure given
   evidence of gross volume overload and hyperkalemia.  Cause unclear, but
   suspect related to antibiotics (was on vancomycin and micafungin
   previously).  Renal consult is pending.
   -          Renal consult pending for consideration of renal replacement
   therapy.
   -          Continue lasix drip for time being.
   -          Will need urine lytes, urine eos, sediment.
   2.       Respiratory Failiure:  Yesterday did not tolerate trach mask
   secondary to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Suspect
   underlying issue is volume overload given evidence of total body
   overload and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  She also has history
   of obstructive lung disease.
   3.       Cdiff/Sepsis: Resolving cdiff colitis.  Abdomen remains
   distended, unclear if worse than recent baseline.  She is
   hemodynamically stable.  Remains on treatment with metronidazole and
   oral vancomycin.
   -          Continue antibiotics; no change in hemodynamics; no fevers
   -          Will continue to monitor clinically, hold on repeat
   abdominal CT for time being.
   4.       Abdominal pain: Perhaps mildly worse than previously. Her KUB
   does not reveal an acute process on a limited study.  Suspect volume
   overload and ascites.
   -          Check amylase/lipase given TPN
   -          Treat with dilaudid per pain service
   5.       Anemia: HCT 24; will monitor
   6.       Endocrine: history of DKA; most recent glucose < 70.   Will
   plan to restart TPN without potassium provided normal amylase/lipase.
   7.       GI: persistent hyperbilirubinemia in setting of critical
   illness and severe infection.  Has been evaluated by Liver service.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Plan to restart TPN today without potassium
   Comments: Currently holding TPN for hyperkalemia
   Glycemic Control:  Currently on insulin drip; holding for hypoglycemia.
   Can stop once restart TPN with glucose.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I was physically present with the housestaff and examined the patient
   on this date
I agree with the above note including that assessment and
   plan and would add the following comments.
   Patient is 42 yo female with prolonged hospital course with initial
   trigger of C. Diff Colitis but now with concern for volume overload and
   hyperkalemia  as relates to continued impaired renal function and
   inability to tolerate trach mask trial, perhaps in large part driven by
   volume overload driving hypoxemia and mild metabolic alkalosis driving
   increased ventilatory demand.
   On exam
patient responsive to voice and answers questions
   appropriately.
   Lungs
Decreased and distant breath sounds
   Abdomen
Very tender to palpation without rebound but very brisk grimace
   with palpation.
   In addition to above will
   -Continue with diuresis with Lasix
   -If unable to effect substantially negative fluid balance over next 24
   hours will need to consider ultrafiltration to aid in mobilization of
   volume
   -Hyperkalemia to be managed as above
   -Abdominal exam is consistent with significant tenderness and KUB as
   reviewed showed NGT in good position and no free air

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and a prolonged ICU stay. She has developed Clostridium difficile infection, persistent respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and worsening renal failure with hyperkalemia. The patient's current issues include renal failure, respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile infection/sepsis, abdominal pain, anemia, endocrine disturbances, and persistent hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of gross volume overload and hyperkalemia, which are indicative of renal failure. The cause is unclear, but antibiotics (vancomycin and micafungin) may be related. A renal consult is pending, and consideration for renal replacement therapy is needed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient did not tolerate a tracheostomy mask trial due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Volume overload, pulmonary edema, and a history of obstructive lung disease may be contributing factors.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection/Sepsis: The patient is resolving cdiff colitis but remains on treatment with metronidazole and oral vancomycin. She is hemodynamically stable, and no change in hemodynamics or fever is noted.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is worsening, and her KUB does not reveal an acute process. Volume overload and ascites are suspected.

199605.0,256267,2189-03-14 10:19:00,Physician ,Physician Attending Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   Overnight she was attempted on trachmask, but did not tolerate
   secondary to tachypnea and acute respiratory acidosis (superimposed
   upon a metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure).  She was
   placed back on PSV 14/5 and Fio2 0.5 with improvement in her
   respiratory acidosis.
   Also, she developed worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her TPN
   was discontinued because it contained potassium; was therefor started
   on insulin gtt and dextrose because of history of DKA.  She remained
   hyperkalemic, and renal was consulted this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with multiple comorbidities and long ICU course complicated by
   cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP; now has worsening renal
   failure and hyperkalemia.
   1.       Renal Failure: Most immediate issue is her renal failure given
   evidence of gross volume overload and hyperkalemia.  Cause unclear, but
   suspect related to antibiotics (was on vancomycin and micafungin
   previously).  Renal consult is pending.
   -          Renal consult pending for consideration of renal replacement
   therapy.
   -          Continue lasix drip for time being.
   -          Will need urine lytes, urine eos, sediment.
   2.       Respiratory Failiure:  Yesterday did not tolerate trach mask
   secondary to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Suspect
   underlying issue is volume overload given evidence of total body
   overload and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  She also has history
   of obstructive lung disease.
   3.       Cdiff/Sepsis: Resolving cdiff colitis.  Abdomen remains
   distended, unclear if worse than recent baseline.  She is
   hemodynamically stable.  Remains on treatment with metronidazole and
   oral vancomycin.
   -          Continue antibiotics; no change in hemodynamics; no fevers
   -          Will continue to monitor clinically, hold on repeat
   abdominal CT for time being.
   4.       Abdominal pain: Perhaps mildly worse than previously. Her KUB
   does not reveal an acute process on a limited study.  Suspect volume
   overload and ascites.
   -          Check amylase/lipase given TPN
   -          Treat with dilaudid per pain service
   5.       Anemia: HCT 24; will monitor
   6.       Endocrine: history of DKA; most recent glucose < 70.   Will
   plan to restart TPN without potassium provided normal amylase/lipase.
   7.       GI: persistent hyperbilirubinemia in setting of critical
   illness and severe infection.  Has been evaluated by Liver service.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Plan to restart TPN today without potassium
   Comments: Currently holding TPN for hyperkalemia
   Glycemic Control:  Currently on insulin drip; holding for hypoglycemia.
   Can stop once restart TPN with glucose.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and a long ICU course. She has been experiencing several medical complications, including c.diff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is evident from the gross volume overload and hyperkalemia. The cause of renal failure is unclear but may be related to antibiotics. A renal consult has been pending, and the plan is to consider renal replacement therapy. Lasix drip should be continued, and urine electrolytes, eosinophils, and sediment analysis are needed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient did not tolerate a tracheostomy mask due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The underlying issue is suspected to be volume overload, as indicated by total body overload and chest X-ray findings consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of obstructive lung disease.

3. Cdiff/Sepsis: The patient's c.diff colitis is resolving, but she remains on treatment with metronidazole and oral vancomycin. There are no changes in hemodynamics or fevers, so the current treatment plan should be continued. Clinical monitoring will continue, and a repeat abdominal CT will be held for now.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has mildly worsened. The kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB)"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with multiple comorbidities and long ICU course complicated by
   cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP; now has worsening renal
   failure and hyperkalemia.
   1.       Renal Failure: Most immediate issue is her renal failure given
   evidence of gross volume overload and hyperkalemia.  Cause unclear, but
   suspect related to antibiotics (was on vancomycin and micafungin
   previously).  Renal consult is pending.
   -          Renal consult pending for consideration of renal replacement
   therapy.
   -          Continue lasix drip for time being.
   -          Will need urine lytes, urine eos, sediment.
   2.       Respiratory Failiure:  Yesterday did not tolerate trach mask
   secondary to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Suspect
   underlying issue is volume overload given evidence of total body
   overload and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  She also has history
   of obstructive lung disease.
   3.       Cdiff/Sepsis: Resolving cdiff colitis.  Abdomen remains
   distended, unclear if worse than recent baseline.  She is
   hemodynamically stable.  Remains on treatment with metronidazole and
   oral vancomycin.
   -          Continue antibiotics; no change in hemodynamics; no fevers
   -          Will continue to monitor clinically, hold on repeat
   abdominal CT for time being.
   4.       Abdominal pain: Perhaps mildly worse than previously. Her KUB
   does not reveal an acute process on a limited study.  Suspect volume
   overload and ascites.
   -          Check amylase/lipase given TPN
   -          Treat with dilaudid per pain service
   5.       Anemia: HCT 24; will monitor
   6.       Endocrine: history of DKA; most recent glucose < 70.   Will
   plan to restart  TPN without potassium provided normal amylase/lipase.
   7.       GI: persistent hyperbilirubinemia in setting of critical
   illness and severe infection.  Has been evaluated by Liver service.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Plan to restart TPN today without potassium
   Comments: Currently holding TPN for hyperkalemia
   Glycemic Control:  Currently on insulin drip; holding for hypoglycemia.
   Can stop once restart TPN with glucose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and a long ICU course. She has developed cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient did not tolerate tracheostomy due to tachypnea and acute respiratory acidosis. She has been placed back on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and supplemental oxygen. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's abdomen remains distended, and she has evidence of ascites. She is on an insulin drip for hyperglycemia and a lasix drip for volume overload. The patient is also receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of gross volume overload and hyperkalemia, indicating worsening renal failure. This could be related to antibiotics she was previously on. Renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient did not tolerate tracheostomy due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Volume overload and pulmonary edema are suspected underlying issues.
3. Cdiff/Sepsis: The patient is resolving cdiff colitis but remains on treatment with metronidazole and oral vancom"

   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   # Pain Management : Still having pain that is difficult to control.
   Discontinued Fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV [**3-9**].  Pain control has
   consistently been a difficult issue, some concern for hypersensitivity
   syndrome.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common viral inclusion disease (VID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure following a tracheostomy.

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient developed high levels of potassium in his blood, which is concerning in the setting of a slowly rising creatinine level. Treatment included stopping total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with potassium, treating hyperkalemia with calcium, bicarbonate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Lasix was also administered for diuresis to help lower potassium levels.

2. Sepsis: The patient developed a fever and required more oxygen last week, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Micafungin was added, and meropenem was reintroduced per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. Vanc/Micafungin were discontinued.

3. C. diff sepsis: The patient had an improvement in colitis on serial CT scans of the abdomen. He received Xigris and IVIG. PO Vancomycin was continued via nasogastric tube, and Flagyl was restarted intravenously. Weekly dose of IVIG as per ID recommendations was also initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC, Type 1 DM, p/w c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS
   and respiratory failure s/p trach
   # Hyperkalemia: New hyperK in setting of slowly rising creatinine.
   - Stopped TPN with K
   - Treated for hyperK with calcium, bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and
   kayexalate
   -  Renal c/s
   - Send urine studies
   - Lasix for diuresis should help lower K
   # Sepsis: Pt developed fever, new oxygen requirement last week,
   suspected VAP, no growth from BAL. Micofungin added [**3-9**], d/c
d [**3-12**].
   Meropenum added back per ID [**3-8**]
 plan for 8 day course of Meropenum.
   Vanc/Micafungin d/c
d [**3-13**]. Sinus CT findings could be consistent with
   sinusitis but impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.
   - Cultured broadly
   - PO Vanco & Flagyl for C Diff
   # C diff sepsis:  now s/p Xigris and IVIG.  Colitis appears improved on
   serial CT scans of the abdomen.  Afebrile. lactate stable
   - d/c Vancomycin retention enemas
   - continue PO Vancomycin via NGT, po flagyl back to IV
   - appreciate ID recs
   - dose IVIG weekly as per ID recs; Q Saturday
   - senna / colace
 make PRN given loose stools
   - Surgery following, CT not concerning, will follow
   - Holding scope although ongoing pain given risk of perforation
   # Respiratory failure:  Developed PNA.  Back on vent for resp distress.
   - Continue vent for now but will try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   # Pain Management : Still having pain that is difficult to control.
   Discontinued Fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV [**3-9**].  Pain control has
   consistently been a difficult issue, some concern for hypersensitivity
   syndrome.
   - Fentanyl & versed gtt should be transitioned to bolus dosing
   dilaudid PRN
   - Pain consult recs appreciated
   # Weakness: Likely ICU myopathy [**1-26**] prolonged illness, paralytics.
   - Continue PT/OT & ultimately plan to rehab
   # Anemia:  HCT trending down, stabilized. Neg DIC labs.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stools
   # Renal Failure:  Creat up, likely intravascularly dry but total body
   overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - Renal c/s today, ? need for CVVH given hyperK
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here.
   - Now NPO again as gut not working well
   - TPN with insulin
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team following,
   nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: likely multifactorial from underlying liver
   disease, acute illness, as well as contribution from hemolysis.  No
   biliary ductal dilatation by CT on [**2-26**] or [**3-8**]. Bili appears to be
   rising (from high teens to 22 to 28 to 26).  RUQ u/s w/o
   choledocholithiasis. Per liver [**3-12**], this is due to severe infection,
   and shouldn
t be evaluated further at this time.
   # Line infection:  s/p HD catheter removal on [**2-26**] with catheter tip
   growing ENTEROCOCCUS.  Blood cx NGTD. No growth from PICC.  Daptomycin
   course completed. F/u blood cultures, NGTD so far.
   # FEN:  TF on hold for now  /  continue free H20 bolus /  TPN
   # PPx:   Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis / VAP bundle / PPI as GI ppx.

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with multiple comorbidities and long ICU course complicated by
   cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP; yesterday with worsening
   renal failure and hyperkalemia, now trending towards improvement.
   1.       Renal Failure: Cr down today at 1.8 and K 4.8.
    - Will aim for TBB negative 500 to 1L today; aim for UOP of 100cc/hr;
   adjust rate as necessary
    - No kayexalate given risk of bowel perforation with colitis
    - No clear indication for renal replacement at this point with
   improved potassium. Appreciate renal input.
   2.       Respiratory Failiure:  Yesterday did not tolerate trach mask
   secondary to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Suspect
   underlying issue is volume overload given evidence of total body
   overload and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  She also has history
   of obstructive lung disease.
    - continue diuresis, bronchodilators. Can trial of TM when more
   euvolemic.
   3.       Cdiff/Sepsis: Resolving cdiff colitis.  Abdomen remains
   distended, unclear if worse than recent baseline.  She is
   hemodynamically stable.  Remains on treatment with metronidazole and
   oral vancomycin.
   -          Continue antibiotics; no change in hemodynamics; no fevers
   -          Will continue to monitor clinically, hold on repeat
   abdominal CT for time being.
   4.       Abdominal pain: Perhaps mildly worse than previously. Her KUB
   does not reveal an acute process on a limited study.  Suspect volume
   overload and ascites. Pain better today. Amylase and lipase negative
   yesterday.
   -          Treat with dilaudid per pain service
   5.  VAP: completes meropenem today. Still with low-grade temps, but
   leukocytosis is improving
   6.       Coagulopathy: possibly in setting of liver dysfunction and
   critical illness; also INR 2.8 but stable.
    - continue to follow; not actively bleeding so no indication for
   replacement.
   7.       GI: persistent hyperbilirubinemia in setting of critical
   illness and severe infection.  Has been evaluated by Liver service.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and a long ICU course.
- She has been complicated by cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia.
- The patient's current condition shows improvement in renal function (Cr down to 1.8 and K 4.8).
- She remains on diuretics, bronchodilators, and treatment for cdiff and VAP.
- The patient's abdominal pain has not significantly improved, but her vital signs remain stable.
- She is also being treated for possible coagulopathy and persistent hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but there is still a risk of worsening renal failure. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure, which may be due to volume overload and underlying obstructive lung disease. Continued diuresis and bronchodilator therapy is recommended.
3. Clostridium difficile (CDiff) Colitis: The patient has resolving cdiff colitis, but she remains at risk for complications such as bowel perforation. Monitoring for any signs of worsening colitis is important.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed meropenem treatment for VAP, but there is still a"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with multiple comorbidities and long ICU course complicated by
   cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, VAP; yesterday with worsening
   renal failure and hyperkalemia, now trending towards improvement.
   1.       Renal Failure: Cr down today at 1.8 and K 4.8.
    - Will aim for TBB negative 500 to 1L today; aim for UOP of 100cc/hr;
   adjust rate as necessary
    - No kayexalate given risk of bowel perforation with colitis
    - No clear indication for renal replacement at this point with
   improved potassium. Appreciate renal input.
   2.       Respiratory Failiure:  Yesterday did not tolerate trach mask
   secondary to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Suspect
   underlying issue is volume overload given evidence of total body
   overload and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.  She also has history
   of obstructive lung disease.
    - continue diuresis, bronchodilators. Can trial of TM when more
   euvolemic.
   3.       Cdiff/Sepsis: Resolving cdiff colitis.  Abdomen remains
   distended, unclear if worse than recent baseline.  She is
   hemodynamically stable.  Remains on treatment with metronidazole and
   oral vancomycin.
   -          Continue antibiotics; no change in hemodynamics; no fevers
   -          Will continue to monitor clinically, hold on repeat
   abdominal CT for time being.
   4.       Abdominal pain: Perhaps mildly worse than previously. Her KUB
   does not reveal an acute process on a limited study.  Suspect volume
   overload and ascites. Pain better today. Amylase and lipase negative
   yesterday.
   -          Treat with dilaudid per pain service
   5.  VAP: completes meropenem today. Still with low-grade temps, but
   leukocytosis is improving
   6.       Coagulopathy: possibly in setting of liver dysfunction and
   critical illness; also INR 2.8 but stable.
    - continue to follow; not actively bleeding so no indication for
   replacement.
   7.       GI: persistent hyperbilirubinemia in setting of critical
   illness and severe infection.  Has been evaluated by Liver service.

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple comorbidities and a long ICU course. She has been complicated by cdiff, persistent respiratory failure, and VAP. Her renal function has improved with a decreasing creatinine level and potassium within normal range. The patient is on a lasix drip for volume overload and hyperkalemia. She remains on treatment for cdiff colitis with metronidazole and oral vancomycin. The patient's respiratory failure is due to suspected volume overload, and she is being treated with bronchodilators and diuretics. Her abdominal pain is mild and better today. She is completing meropenem for VAP and has low-grade temperatures but improving leukocytosis. She has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR but no active bleeding. She also has persistent hyperbilirubinemia due to critical illness and severe infection. The patient is on TPN with lipids for nutrition and receives prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and adjustments should be made to the lasix drip as necessary to maintain adequate urine output and avoid further electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory Failure: Continued treatment with diuretics and bronchodilators is recommended. Once the patient becomes more euvolemic, a trial of tr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of arterial line stop. The patient has a history of chronic illness and is currently on several medications including hydromorphone, pantoprazole, furosemide, and dextrose. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 64 kg at admission to 59.9 kg currently. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The patient's ABG results indicate an unspecified abnormality. Physical examination reveals jaundice, warm skin, and decreased tone. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Imaging shows marked ascites without evidence of bowel obstruction. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including pulmonary edema, marked ascites, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, impaired muscle performance, altered nutrition, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's pain control, attention, and cognition are also impaired. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: This condition refers to fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can impair oxygen exchange and lead to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can be caused by heart failure or other conditions affecting lung fluid balance.

2. Marked ascites: The patient has an excessive buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which may be due to liver disease or other underlying conditions.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in their blood, which can be dangerous and may require treatment with medications such as insulin, calcium, and kayexalate.

4. Sepsis: The patient developed fever and new oxygen requirements, indicating a possible infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics and other medications to address the sepsis.

5. C. diff sepsis: The patient had an infection caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff), a bacteria commonly associated with antibiotic use. The patient received treatment for C. diff sepsis, including Xigris and IVIG.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient developed pneumonia (PNA) and required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

7. Pain management difficulties: The patient has ongoing pain that is difficult to control, possibly due to hypersensitivity syndrome.

8. Weakness: The patient is likely experiencing ICU myopathy, which can occur due to prolonged illness and the use of paralytics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and continues to be on mechanical ventilation.
2. Liver failure: The patient has chronic hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis, which may lead to worsening liver function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, suggesting anemia that requires further evaluation and management.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia and is currently receiving dextrose infusions.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a bleeding risk that needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Line infection: The patient had a line infection due to the removal of a central venous catheter with Enterococcus species growth."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity, altered arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. They have a history of allergies, recent antibiotic use, and fluid overload. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The patient's plan includes managing acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile infection, pain, ICU myopathy, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines inserted for medication administration. Prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure, along with the presence of crackles in the chest and an abnormal ABG, suggests the possibility of ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's oliguria (low urine output) and elevated"

   I saw and examined this pt, and was present with the ICU team for the
   key portions of services provided. Despite good urine output with a
   lasix gtt, net fluid balance has been even with diffuse bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and continued need for ventilatory support. Problems
   include:
   1. Acute renal failure from ATN vs AIN
increasing lasix gtt today and
   concentrating IV intake
   2. Acute respiratory failure: comfortable on PSV (PS 14); likely needs
   additional fluid off before able to make significant progress on
   weaning vent
   3. Cdiff colitis: on flagyl/vanco
   4. Coagulopathy: INR
s had been mostly unchanged but have increased
   over the past 1-2 days- concerning for worsening liver fx though could
   represent malnutrtion. Have challenged with vit K and will f/u INR.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications that can arise. The potential medical complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has diffuse bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray and continues to require ventilatory support. This suggests respiratory failure, which may be due to acute lung injury or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is experiencing impaired skin integrity, possibly due to bed rest or immobility. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the exact cause.

4. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, as indicated by the presence of toxins in the stool. Appropriate treatment with antibiotics such as vancomycin or metronidazole is necessary.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient exhibits abnormal coagulation parameters, including an elevated INR and low platelet count. This may be due to liver dysfunction, malnutrition, or recent sepsis. Monitoring and appropriate management are required.

6. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. It is important to monitor"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), presenting with sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has developed multiple complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, pain management issues, weakness (likely ICU myopathy), anemia, renal failure, diabetes type I, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilatory support. The patient is sedated and encephalopathic.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and lactate levels. The platelet count is low, and there is evidence of DIC with elevated D-dimer levels.

The patient's medical history includes sepsis from C. diff infection, ARDS, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy placement. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem and vancomycin. The patient has also received Xigris and IVIG for C."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common viral inclusion disease (CID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has undergone various interventions, including tracheostomy, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, administration of Xigris, and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). He has also received pain management and physical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and decreased nutritional status.
2. Pain control: The patient continues to experience pain that is difficult to control, and there is a concern for hypersensitivity syndrome.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is a need to gradually wean him off the ventilator and transition to tracheostomy with only ventilation support.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is trending down, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate production. Close monitoring and transfusion for HCT<21 are recommended.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting renal impairment. The cause could be intravascular volume depletion or total body overload. Fluid management and renal dose medications are necessary.
6. Diabetes mellitus type 1: The patient developed"

   portions of the services provided. I would add: 42 yo female with
   cirrhosis admitted with severe Cdiff colitis/sepsis; acute issues of
   acute respiratory failure on PSV, acute renal failure (ATN/sepsis, +/-
   component of ATN). Diuresed some with lasix infusion, but still with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis admitted for severe Clostridium difficile colitis and sepsis. She is currently critically ill and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure (possibly due to acute tubular necrosis), hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy, and disordered muscle performance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. Diff sepsis: The patient has been treated with meropenem for 8 days for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but she continues to show signs of infection and may require further antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on positive pressure ventilation support and may need to be weaned off gradually. FiO2 has been increased to 0.4 and the pressure support has been decreased to 10.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's renal function is impaired, and diuresis with lasix and diuril may be necessary. Fluid management is crucial to prevent worsening of renal function.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. Coagulation parameters are abnormal, indicating a risk of bleeding. Vitamin K may have been administered, and fibrinogen levels should be monitored.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin in the"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common viral inclusion disease (CID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia and developed sepsis due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, pain, weakness, anemia, renal failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, line infection, and femoral nerve palsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to C. diff infection. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.

2. ARDS: The patient developed ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid buildup in the alveoli. It can result in respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to prolonged bed rest and limited mobility. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.

4. Pain: The patient continues to experience pain, which can be challenging to control. Uncontrolled pain can lead to increased stress, agitation, and impaired recovery.

5. Weakness: The patient exhibits weakness, which is likely due to prolonged immobilization and muscle"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications and allergies, including aspirin, penicillins, sulfonamides, Biaxin (Clarithromycin), Levaquin (Levofloxacin), Cefzil (Cefprozil), Motrin (Ibuprofen), erythromycin base, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs show a low-grade temperature, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving supplemental oxygen. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and hypoxemia.

The physical examination reveals scleral edema, jaundice, and muscle wasting. The patient is unable to stand or move properly. The neurologic examination is impaired, with the patient following simple commands but not assessed for movement, tone, or response to stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Other lab abnormalities include elevated D-dimer, lactic acidosis, low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

The patient's medical history includes abdominal pain, diarrhea,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple allergies and is currently on various medications including antibiotics, pain medications, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR) within normal range, low blood pressure (BP), increased respiratory rate (RR), and an oxygen saturation level of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen with no bowel sounds present, tender abdomen, distended abdomen, jaundice, and warm extremities. Neurologically, the patient responds to verbal stimuli and shows no spontaneous movement.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated creatinine (Cr), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated lactate, and elevated D-dimer levels. Imaging studies reveal diffuse soft tissue anasarca, bilateral ground-glass opacities with nodular component, and persistent nodular consolidation at the right lower lobe."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a medical history of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to multiple health complications. The patient has developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. He also has pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status has been somewhat decreased over the last few days, and there is concern for a new infection. His pain management, weakness, anemia, renal failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia are being closely monitored and managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis due to C. diff infection. It is important to monitor his vital signs and laboratory values, including white blood cell count, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Antibiotics should be continued, and source control measures should be implemented.

2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters is crucial. The patient may require continued mechanical ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and ARDS. Proper management of his respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cirrhosis. The patient presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, mental status changes, anemia, renal failure, hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia.

The patient's medical complications include sepsis, C. diff colitis, ARDS, acute kidney injury, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and possible liver dysfunction. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, and coagulopathy.

The patient's imaging studies reveal diffuse soft tissue anasarca, bilateral ground-glass opacities with nodular components suggestive of ARDS or edema, persistent nodular consolidation at the right lower lobe, and small right pleural effusion.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis, vancomycin and metronidazole for C. diff, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for C. diff, and supportive care for respiratory failure, including mechanical ventilation.

 concern for possible evidence of liver
   function declining vs sepsis
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team following,
   nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN
   # Coagulopathy: Acute worsening [**3-15**] with increased INR to 3.9, today
   3.3.  Unclear etiology whether worsening of liver function or
   malnutrition or antibiotic effect.  DIC labs checked and normal [**3-16**].
   - Vit K challenge [**3-16**]
   - Trend, transfuse FFP PRN bleeding
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: likely multifactorial from underlying liver
   disease, acute illness, as well as contribution from hemolysis.  No
   biliary ductal dilatation by CT on [**2-26**] or [**3-8**]. Bili appears to be
   rising (from high teens to 22 to 28 to 26).  RUQ u/s w/o
   choledocholithiasis. Per liver [**3-12**], this is due to severe infection,
   and shouldn
t be evaluated further at this time.
   # Pain Management: Less of an issue given current mental status
   - Dilaudid prn; not using currently given her AMS for ?sepsis
   - Pain consult recs appreciated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent paracentesis and received Xigris and IVIG. He also had a tracheostomy placed. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, anemia, and hyperkalemia. He has developed multiple infections and has required aggressive management for pain control, mental status changes, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with C. diff sepsis, which required aggressive treatment including antibiotics, Xigris, and IVIG. There is a concern for new sepsis given the recent increase in white blood cell count and clinical deterioration.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient developed ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy placement. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's unstable condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has experienced renal failure, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level and low urine output. This may necessitate renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has chronic liver disease and hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, presenting with Clostridium difficile sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing fever, new oxygen requirement, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure. He has also had an increase in white blood cell count and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's mental status has decreased, and there is concern for a new infection. A CT scan of the head shows no acute process. The patient's renal function has worsened, and he has developed hyperkalemia. He also has anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and his liver function is declining. The patient's coagulation profile has improved with Vitamin K administration. He has hyperbilirubinemia, which is likely multifactorial, and his pain management is being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was with Clostridium difficile sepsis. There is a concern for ongoing infection due to the increase in white blood cell count and fever.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient developed ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure and complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to infection.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's urine sodium levels are consistent with hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has impaired gas exchange, as indicated by low oxygen saturation and elevated respiratory rates. ARDS is a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

4. Delirium: The patient is described as delirious and experiencing daytime somnolence, suggesting altered mental status and cognitive impairment.

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), and previous colonization with Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He presented with symptoms consistent with sepsis and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, renal failure, anemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy.

Respiratory Failure: The patient developed pneumonia (PNA) and required reintubation and mechanical ventilation.

Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers (bedsores) due to prolonged immobility.

Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has decreased over the last few days, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, infection, or medication-related causes.

Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. This may be related to intravascular volume depletion and overloading.

Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. It is likely due to chronic disease and possible blood loss.

Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient shows signs of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by altered mental status and hyperammonemia.

Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (VID), hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, which led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and was placed on mechanical ventilation. He developed fever and new oxygen requirement, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but no growth from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Micafungin was added, and meropenem was restarted.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), impaired skin integrity, pain control issues, oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, and altered nutrition.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has evidence of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure seen in advanced liver disease.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bedrest and lack of mobility.
3. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute pain and chronic pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has episodes of hyp"

   - paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; follow-up
   cultures
   # C diff sepsis:  now s/p Xigris and IVIG.  Colitis appears improved on
   serial CT scans of the abdomen.  Afebrile. Lactate stable.  have d/c
   Vancomycin retention enemas. Holding scope although ongoing pain given
   risk of perforation
   - continue PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - Surgery following, have not seen in a while, no significant change on
   CT [**3-19**]
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   - hold TFs
   # Respiratory failure:  Developed PNA.  Back on vent for resp distress.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - FIO2 40%
   - Attempt diuresis restart [**3-20**]
   - f/u renal rec
   # Mental status: Somewhat decreased over the last few days, concerning
   for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o acute
   process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy
   - limit sedating meds; infection as above
   - Now with rub on exam, BUN increasing; plan for HD & will discuss with
   Renal
   # Anemia:  HCT trending down, stabilized. Neg DIC labs.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**3-20**]
   # Renal Failure:  Creat up, likely intravascularly dry but total body
   overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**].
   Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium, bicarb, insulin,
   dextrose, and kayexalate
 DO NOT give further kayexylate
 K now in
   normal range. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**] which was 22 (very poor).
   -  Renal c/s, may need CVVH soon given rising BUN:Cr
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (urine lytes [**3-20**] with Na < 10)
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic again overnight,
   glucose has been difficult to control.
   - holding TFs
   - TPN with insulin
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team following,
   nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN
   # Coagulopathy: Acute worsening [**3-15**] with increased INR to 3.9, today
   3.3.  Unclear etiology whether worsening of liver unction or
   malnutrition or antibiotic effect.  DIC labs checked and normal [**3-16**].
   Vit K challenge [**3-16**] with minimal improvement.
   - Trend, transfuse FFP PRN bleeding
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: likely multifactorial from underlying liver
   disease, acute illness, as well as contribution from hemolysis.  No
   iliary ductal dilatation by CT on [**2-26**] or [**3-8**]. Bili appears to be
   rising (from high teens to 22 to 28 to 26).  RUQ u/s w/o
   holedocholithiasis. Per liver [**3-12**], this is due to severe infection,
   and shouldn
t be evaluated further at this time.
    # Pain Management: Less of an issue given current mental status
   - Dilaudid prn; not using currently given her AMS for ?sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic liver disease, Hepatitis C, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for approximately one month, experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular issues. He has developed hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, pain control problems, oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, and impaired mental status. The patient's medical team is managing his complex condition with various interventions, including antibiotic therapy, hemodialysis, transfusions, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that can occur in patients with severe liver disease.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to immobility, poor nutrition, or the use of invasive devices.
3. Pain control problems: The patient may experience acute and chronic pain due to multiple factors, such as infections, surgeries, or underlying medical conditions.
4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient may have decreased urine output, which can be caused by kidney dysfunction or fluid imbalance.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient may experience low blood sugar levels, especially considering his history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
6. Impaired mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with c.diff sepsis, ARDS, and respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including hepatic, renal, and hematologic abnormalities. He has been treated with various antibiotics, IVIG, and other supportive measures. The patient's current status is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and anemia. He also has thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and respiratory distress may lead to continued difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which can potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. This may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not addressed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels require careful management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.

   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC, Type 1 DM, p/w c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS
   and respiratory failure s/p trach
   # Sepsis:  Initially with C.diff sepsis now s/p Xigris and IVIG.
   Colitis appears improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen.  Afebrile.
   Lactate stable.  have d/c Vancomycin retention enemas. Holding scope
   although ongoing pain given risk of perforation Then patient developed
   fever, new oxygen requirement last week, suspected VAP, no growth from
   BAL. Micofungin added [**3-9**], d/c
d [**3-12**].  Meropenum added back per ID
   [**3-8**]
 8 day course of Meropenum completed [**3-15**]. [**Month/Year (2) 2601**]/Micafungin d/c
   [**3-13**]. Sinus CT findings could be consistent with sinusitis but
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.  WBC count increased
   from 22 to 34 but afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far negative except
   yeast.  CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] without clear source.
   - PO Vanco & IV Flagyl for C Diff
   - On [**Last Name (un) 350**] / [**Last Name (un) 2601**] restarted [**2189-3-19**] with increased leukocytosis, unclear
   source
 stopped [**Name (NI) 2601**] [**2189-3-21**]
   - Plan for 15 day course of [**Last Name (un) 350**] for Pseudomonas, day #1 [**3-19**] (of 15)
   - will continue to consider pulling PICC, CVL
   - paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; follow-up
   cultures
   - appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - Surgery following, have not seen in a while, no significant change on
   CT [**3-19**]
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   - restart trophic TFs
   # Respiratory failure:  Developed PNA.  Back on vent for resp distress.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2
   - Attempt diuresis restart [**3-20**], now on CVVH
   # Mental status: Somewhat decreased over the last few days, concerning
   for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o acute
   process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy
   - limit sedating meds; infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   # Anemia:  HCT trending down, stabilized. Neg DIC labs.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; TRANSFUSE 2u PRBC today [**2189-3-22**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**3-20**]
   # Thrombocytopenia: < 100 on [**3-21**], worsening over the last several day
   in the setting of Vancomycin.  Could represent continued worsening of
   her liver failure.  Will hold sending HIT antibody for now given
   minimal exposure to heparin (just in flush for CVVH and drop preceded
   this).
   - Trend
   - Send DIC labs
   # Renal Failure:  Creat up, likely intravascularly dry but total body
   overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**].
   Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium, bicarb, insulin,
   dextrose, and kayexalate
 DO NOT give further kayexylate
 K now in
   normal range. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**] which was 22 (very poor).
   -  Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**]
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic again overnight,
   glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**2189-3-22**]
   - TPN with insulin
   # Cirrhosis/hepatic failure:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following, nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN.
   - Ask Liver to reassess today
   # Coagulopathy: Acute worsening [**3-15**] with increased INR to 3.9, today
   3.3.  Unclear etiology whether worsening of liver function or
   malnutrition or antibiotic effect.  DIC labs checked and normal [**3-16**].
   Vit K challenge [**3-16**] with minimal improvement.
   - Trend, transfuse FFP PRN bleeding
   - DIC labs
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: likely multifactorial from underlying liver
   disease, acute illness, as well as contribution from hemolysis.  No
   iliary ductal dilatation by CT on [**2-26**] or [**3-8**]. Bili appears to be
   rising (from high teens to 22 to 28 to 26).  RUQ u/s w/o
   holedocholithiasis. Per liver [**3-12**], this is due to severe infection,
   and shouldn
t be evaluated further at this time.
    # Pain Management: Less of an issue given current mental status
   - Dilaudid prn; not using currently given her AMS for ?sepsis
   # Weakness: Likely ICU myopathy [**1-26**] prolonged illness, paralytics.
   Once improves pursue PT/OT & ultimately plan to rehab

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of common viral inclusion disease (CID), Hepatitis C, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on various antibiotics and received IVIG treatment. He has also undergone several interventions including paracentesis, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration), and TPN (total parenteral nutrition).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, but no specific cause is mentioned.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, likely secondary to liver dysfunction.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has poor dentition and is at risk for pressure ulcers.
4. Pain control: The patient requires pain management due to acute and chronic pain issues.
5. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has decreased urine output.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of low blood sugar, particularly during his stay in the ICU.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
8. Impaired aerobic capacity/endurance: The patient's physical activity level is compromised due to his illness.

   past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].
   - Thrush/[**Female First Name (un) 474**]: received about 5 days of IV fluconazole -> will D/C
   [**3-24**]
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve -> re-consider infectious sources if
   leukocytosis worsens
   - Cont to consider pulling PICC, CVL
   - s/p paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; cultures
   negative
   - Appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - On trophic TFs
   - Surgery following rrom distance: CT [**3-19**] unremarkable
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely related to sepsis and pneumonia.  Given
   deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to wean.  Now s/p trach.
   Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.  Oxygenating well.  ABGs
   stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Today seems slightly more
   lucid, eyes open, trying to answer questions.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**]
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable currently.  Neg DIC labs.  s/p 2
   units prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of
   bleeding.  Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Has been
   worsening over the last few days in the setting of vanco and other
   antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to liver failure and low
   thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic sequestration.  Not thought to be
   HIT given many other reasons to be thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T/S
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**3-20**]
   - Trend Plts -> DIC neg
   - D/C Flagyl yesterday
   - Repeat blood smear to look for shistocytes
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic intermittently
   overnight, glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**2189-3-22**]
   - TPN with insulin
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.
   Coagulopathy:
   - Cont to trend INR
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic viral hepatitis infection, cirrhosis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. She presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has also experienced renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support, and she is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and is currently experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
2. Renal failure: The patient has developed renal failure, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis. This condition may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Pseudomonal VAP: The patient has pseudomonal VAP, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications and potential spread of infection.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient initially presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, which can recur and lead to complications such as colitis and toxic megacolon.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of complicated viral hepatitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and chronic hepatitis C infection. He presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia.

The patient's condition has been unstable with recurrent infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), candida infection, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He has required multiple courses of antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's liver function has deteriorated, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. He also has evidence of portal hypertension with ascites and esophageal varices.

The patient's renal function has significantly declined, necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). He has been on mechanical ventilation and has experienced difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he requires enteral and parenteral nutrition.

Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has signs of acute kidney injury in the context of liver failure.

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatitis C, type 1 diabetes mellitus, presenting with c.diff sepsis and subsequent ARDS. He has multiple medical complications including hepato-renal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, oliguria/anuria, hypoglycemia, respiratory failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, altered nutrition, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient initially presented with c.diff sepsis and was treated with Xigris and IVIG. His colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of the abdomen. However, he developed fever, new oxygen requirement last week, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with no growth from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Micafungin was added on [3-9] and discontinued on [3-12]. Meropenum was restarted on [3-8].

The patient's WBC count increased from 22 to 34, but he remains afebrile. Cultures have been negative except for yeast. A CT abdomen/pelvic was performed on [3-19] without clear source.

   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.

   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and cryptosporidium infection. She presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been treated with various antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. The patient's condition remains stable, but she continues to experience respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to sepsis, pneumonia, and ARDS. Continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is likely caused by liver dysfunction and medication effects. Treatment involves lactulose administration and avoiding medications that can worsen hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure could be attributed to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated, and albumin supplementation may be required.
4. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: Anemia and thrombocytopenia may be related to"

   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, h/o cryptosporidium in the
   past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].
   - Thrush/[**Female First Name (un) 474**]: received about 5 days of IV fluconazole -> will D/C
   [**3-24**]
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve -> re-consider infectious sources if
   leukocytosis worsens
   - Cont to consider pulling PICC, CVL
   - s/p paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; cultures
   negative
   - Appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - On trophic TFs
   - Surgery following rrom distance: CT [**3-19**] unremarkable
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely related to sepsis and pneumonia.  Given
   deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to wean.  Now s/p trach.
   Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.  Oxygenating well.  ABGs
   stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Today seems slightly more
   lucid, eyes open, trying to answer questions.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**]
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable currently.  Neg DIC labs.  s/p 2
   units prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of
   bleeding.  Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Has been
   worsening over the last few days in the setting of vanco and other
   antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to liver failure and low
   thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic sequestration.  Not thought to be
   HIT given many other reasons to be thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T/S
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**3-20**]
   - Trend Plts -> DIC neg
   - D/C Flagyl yesterday
   - Repeat blood smear to look for shistocytes
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic intermittently
   overnight, glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**2189-3-22**]
   - TPN with insulin
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.
   Coagulopathy:
   - Cont to trend INR
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - Close monitoring for other causes -> ie DIC labs
   - No signs of bleeding currently

   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, h/o cryptosporidium in the
   past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].
   - Thrush/[**Female First Name (un) 474**]: received about 3 days of IV fluconazole -> D/C
d [**3-24**]
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve -> re-consider infectious sources if
   leukocytosis cont to worsen
   - Cont to consider pulling PICC, CVL if cont to improve
   - s/p paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; cultures
   negative
   - Appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - check SPEP on [**2189-3-27**]
   - On trophic TFs
   - Surgery following rrom distance: CT [**3-19**] unremarkable
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Appreciate Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**] -> held for 8hrs today, will
   resume afterwards
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable.  Neg DIC labs.  s/p 2 units
   prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Increased to 93
   today.  ? medication effect.  Had been worsening over the last few days
   in the setting of vanco and other antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to
   liver failure and low thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic
   sequestration.  Not thought to be HIT given many other reasons to be
   thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]

   overnight, glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**2189-3-22**]
   - D/C TPN
   - Will need insulin support
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), hepatic cirrhosis/ESLD, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and hepatic encephalopathy. He also has renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia. The patient is currently stable on broad-spectrum antibiotics, treated for C. diff, pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and urinary tract infection (UTI). He remains afebrile off pressors.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tachycardia - ongoing monitoring
2. Hepatorenal syndrome - managed with CVVH and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
3. Impaired skin integrity - monitored for pressure ulcers
4. Pain control - Dilaudid prn
5. Oliguria/anuria - CVVH
6. Hypoglycemia - insulin support
7. Respiratory failure - continue ventilatory support, weaning FIO2 prn, pressure support for comfort prn
8. Impaired aerobic capacity/endurance - rehabilitative efforts
9. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition - restart lactulose, limit sedating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of viral hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and previous cryptosporidium infection. She presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She also has hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure (likely hepatorenal syndrome), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and malnutrition. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for C. difficile, pseudomonal VAP, and urinary tract infection. She is also receiving treatment for her type 1 diabetes and HCV cirrhosis/ESLD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Infection: The patient initially presented with C. difficile sepsis and subsequently developed fever, respiratory distress, and concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She was treated with Xigris and IVIG, and her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans. However, she developed new infections, including pseudomonal VAP and urinary tract infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to sepsis and pneumonia. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her ABGs are stable, but she is still on the ventilator. The plan is to continue weaning FIO2 prn and attempt to transition to trache"

   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, h/o cryptosporidium in the
   past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].
   - Thrush/[**Female First Name (un) 474**]: received about 3 days of IV fluconazole -> D/C
d [**3-24**]
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve -> re-consider infectious sources if
   leukocytosis cont to worsen
   - Cont to consider pulling PICC, CVL if cont to improve
   - s/p paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**3-19**]; cultures
   negative
   - Appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - check SPEP on [**2189-3-27**]
   - On trophic TFs
   - Surgery following rrom distance: CT [**3-19**] unremarkable
   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   .
   # SVT- likely volume and electrolytes changes related vs MOSD
   - s/p CV
   - amiodarone gtt, no clear guidelines for liver disease
   - will continue amio loading for now given unclear trigger
   - decrease amount of volume removal on CVVH given this was possible
   trigger
   .
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Appreciate Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**] -> held for 8hrs today, will
   resume afterwards
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable.  Neg DIC [**Month/Year (2) **].  s/p 2 units
   prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Increased to 93
   today.  ? medication effect.  Had been worsening over the last few days
   in the setting of vanco and other antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to
   liver failure and low thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic
   sequestration.  Not thought to be HIT given many other reasons to be
   thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T/S
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**3-20**]
   - Trend Plts -> DIC neg
   - D/C Flagyl yesterday
   - Blood smear with 2+ schistocytes, ? low grade DIC, cont to monitor
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic intermittently
   overnight, glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**2189-3-22**]
   - D/C TPN
   - Will need insulin support
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.
   Coagulopathy:
   - Cont to trend INR
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - Close monitoring for other causes -> ie DIC [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - No signs of bleeding currently
   Hyperbili:
   - Cont to trend
   - f/u with liver re: U/S and poor portal flow, hold off CT scan given
   this would not change mgmt, ie anticoagulation
   Transaminases:

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: MICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), presenting with Clostridium difficile sepsis. She has had multiple complications including respiratory failure, hepato-renal syndrome, pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and malnutrition.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on mechanical ventilation (vent) due to sepsis and pneumonia. The plan is to continue vent support and gradually wean off when acute issues are stabilized.

2. Hepato-Renal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has evidence of renal failure with a creatinine clearance of 22 (very poor) on 3/16. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was started on 3/21 and held for 8 hours today. The patient is also on albumin PRN, midodrine/octreotide for HRS, and renal dose medications.

3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a stable hematocrit (HCT) but with thrombocytopenia (platelets <100 on 3/21). The cause is likely multifactorial, including medication effect, liver failure, low thrombopoietin, and splenic sequestration. Trend HCT and transfuse for HCT<21. IV PPI is given for GI prophylaxis.

4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient developed DKA while in the hospital. Insulin support is required for glycemic control.

5. HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD: The patient has chronic HCV infection with stable transaminases but increasing bilirubin. Liver consult team is following up. Transaminases are trending upwards, likely due to acute infection and poor liver compensation. An ultrasound (U/S) on 3/23 shows poor portal flow without other acute processes. No obvious thrombosis is seen, and INR is indicative of decompensated liver disease. DIC panel is negative. Vitamin K has no effect on coagulopathy.

The patient's pain management is less of an issue given the current mental status. Weakness is likely due to ICU myopathy and prolonged illness, with plans for physical therapy/rehabilitation once improved.

FEN (feeding): Trophic tube feeds are given, and TPN with lipids is initiated on 3/21.

PPx (prophylaxis): Pneumoboots are used for DVT prophylaxis, VAP bundle is implemented, and PPI is given for GI prophylaxis.

Access includes PICC line, multi-lumen line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter.

Code status is full code, and disposition is ICU."

   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic liver disease, hepatitis C cirrhosis/ESLD, type 1 diabetes mellitus, presenting with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has acute kidney injury (AKI) on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic encephalopathy, and malnutrition.

Potential medical complications:
1. Unstable atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone and cardioversion.
2. Sepsis/infection: C. diff sepsis initially, followed by pseudomonal VAP. Broad antimicrobials are being administered.
3. Respiratory failure: ARDS and pneumonia, currently stable but not expected to wean from the ventilator soon.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: Impaired kidney function due to liver disease.
5. Impaired skin integrity: May be related to malnutrition and immobility.
6. Pain control: Acute and chronic pain management.
7. Oliguria/anuria: Decreased urine output.
8. Hypoglycemia: Difficult to control blood glucose levels.
9. Multiorgan dysfunction: Coagulopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.
10. HCV cirrhosis/ESLD: Decompensated"

   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

   the past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   .
   #Unstable Atrial fibrillation
 required amiodarone gtt and
   cardioversion for Afib with RVR with MAP ~39-45, since starting
   amiodarone and giving 100g IV albumin.  Likely [**1-26**] underlying
   multiorgan dysfunction and volume shifts with CVVH.
   -continue amio gtt
   -conservative volume removal with CVVH
   .
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve
   - f/u blood cultures
   -dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - check SPEP on [**2189-3-27**]
   - On trophic TFs
   .
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.
   Coagulopathy:
   - Cont to trend INR
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - Close monitoring for other causes -> ie DIC [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - No signs of bleeding currently
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   .
   # SVT- likely volume and electrolytes changes related vs MOSD
   - s/p CV
   - amiodarone gtt, no clear guidelines for liver disease
   - will continue amio loading for now given unclear trigger
   - decrease amount of volume removal on CVVH given this was possible
   trigger
   .
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Appreciate Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**] -> held for 8hrs today, will
   resume afterwards
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable.  Neg DIC [**Month/Year (2) **].  s/p 2 units
   prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Increased to 93
   today.  ? medication effect.  Had been worsening over the last few days
   in the setting of vanco and other antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to
   liver failure and low thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic
   sequestration.  Not thought to be HIT given many other reasons to be
   thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic viral hepatitis C infection, liver cirrhosis, and esophageal varices bleeding. She presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hypoglycemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition occurs due to liver dysfunction and the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream, which affect brain function. Symptoms may include confusion, altered mental status, and decreased levels of consciousness.

2. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of waste products and toxins in the body. This can result in fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. It is important to monitor for any signs of bleeding and adjust medications accordingly.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low red blood cell count, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Blood transfusions may be required to improve oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are low, which"

   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, h/o cryptosporidium in the
   past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 474**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],
   d/c
d [**3-12**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**4-2**] (d1=[**3-19**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**3-21**].

   - follow bladder pressures ([**3-18**] was 18
 [**3-19**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**3-20**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**3-15**]. CT head [**3-19**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**3-13**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**3-16**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Appreciate Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**3-21**] -> held for 8hrs today, will
   resume afterwards
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**3-20**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable.  Neg DIC [**Month/Year (2) **].  s/p 2 units
   prbcs [**2189-02-21**].  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   Plt <100 [**3-21**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Increased to 93
   today.  ? medication effect.  Had been worsening over the last few days
   in the setting of vanco and other antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to
   liver failure and low thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic
   sequestration.  Not thought to be HIT given many other reasons to be
   thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**2189-3-22**]

   - D/C TPN
   - Will need insulin support
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**3-23**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic viral hepatitis (VID), Hepatitis C cirrhosis/End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), presenting with Clostridium difficile sepsis, complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure post-tracheostomy, as well as Pseudomonal Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). She also has Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which required cardioversion.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to HRS, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, along with the presence of eosinophils in the urine. She is currently on CVVH and albumin infusion.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has jaundice and anasarca, indicating impaired skin integrity.

4. Pain Control: The patient requires aggressive pain management due to acute pain from various interventions and chronic pain from underlying conditions.

   TPN was d/c'd as she was at goal on her tube feedings
   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). She presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure after undergoing tracheostomy. She also has pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection with [Female First Name (un)].

Assessment and Plan:
- Sepsis/infection: The patient initially presented with C. diff sepsis, which improved with Xigris and IVIG. She then developed fever, respiratory distress, and concern for VAP. Initial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative, but treated with meropenem. Sputum culture grew pseudomonas, and she was restarted on meropenem, vancomycin was discontinued. Micafungin was added and then discontinued. Sinus CT findings raised concern for sinusitis. WBC count increased from 22 to 34, but she remained afebrile. Cultures were broadly sent, and so far, only [Female First Name (un)] was positive in the urine. CT abdomen/pelvic was unremarkable. Paracentesis was also unremarkable. She is currently stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C. diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [Female First Name (un)]/thrush. She remains afebrile off pressors.
- C. diff colitis: Continue PO vancomycin for C. diff (Flagyl discontinued due to thrombocytopenia) -> continue for 2 weeks after completing other antibiotics.
- Pseudomonal VAP: Continue meropenem x15 days through [4-2] (started on [3-19]). Was on vancomycin initially though stopped on [3-21].
- Thrush/[Female First Name (un)]: received about 3 days of IV fluconazole -> Discontinued on [3-24].
- Cont to trend WBC, fever curve -> re-consider infectious sources if leukocytosis continues to worsen.
- Cont to consider pulling PICC, CVL if continues to improve.
- s/p paracentesis (therapeutic / diagnostic) completed on [3-19]; cultures negative.
- Appreciate ID recs: dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday.
- Check SPEP on [2189-3-27].
- On trophic TFs.
- Surgery follow-up from distance: CT on [3-19] unremarkable.
- Follow bladder pressures ([3-18] was 18, [3-19] s/p paracentesis down to 4).
- Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for transitioning once acute issues stabilized.
- Wean FIO2 prn.

   TPN was d/c'd as she was at goal on her tube feedings
   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. She has been on mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's condition has been unstable with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and hypotension. She received multiple cardioversions and defibrillations. Her blood cultures were sent, and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. It is important to closely monitor her oxygenation and ventilatory parameters.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of recent antibiotic use and current signs of infection, there is a risk of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, is crucial.

3. Kidney Injury: As the patient has chronic kidney disease and is receiving CRRT, there is a risk of further kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are necessary.

4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Continuous cardiac monitoring and antiarrhythmic medications may be required.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes management may be"

   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],

   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.  Placed back on

   high 90 day mortality based on her MELD.  Coagulopathy continues to
   worsen.  Complicated by multiorgan dysfunction with coagulopathy,
   anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure.  She is also severely
   malnourished.
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - continue with supportive care.

   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**3-8**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**3-18**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**3-13**].  Micofungin added [**3-9**],

   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**3-19**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**3-19**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 474**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.

   high 90 day mortality based on her MELD.  Coagulopathy continues to
   worsen.  Complicated by multiorgan dysfunction with coagulopathy,
   anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure.  She is also severely
   malnourished.
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - continue with supportive care.

   # Respiratory failure:  Stable at this time, likely related to sepsis
   and pneumonia.  Stable but no indication that she would be able to wean
   from the vent anytime in the near future.
   -continue with pressure support

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and cryptosporidium infection. She presented with Clostridium difficile sepsis and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been treated for C. diff, pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and urinary tract infection. She remains on broad antimicrobials and is currently stable without the need for vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Infection: The patient initially presented with C. diff sepsis and has since developed respiratory distress and concern for VAP. She was treated with Xigris and IVIG, and her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans. However, she developed fever and respiratory distress again, and the sputum culture grew pseudomonas, leading to the restart of meropenem. The patient remains on broad antimicrobials, including meropenem for pseudomonal VAP.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has decompensated liver failure with a high MELD score, indicating a poor prognosis. She also has renal failure, which may be due to HRS or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH has been initiated for uremia and volume overload.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable at the moment but likely has respiratory failure secondary to"
