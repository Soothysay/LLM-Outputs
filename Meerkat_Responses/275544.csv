   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 40 yo F with PMHx sig. for metastatic breast cancer to
   liver, lungs, and brain.
   .
   1.  PEA arrest:  Pt in PEA arrest briefly, only requiring less than 2
   minutes of chest compressions.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to hypoxia.
   .
   2.  Seizure:  Pt has known seizure disorder from brain metastases.  Has
   been on dilantin and keppra.  CT head from OSH actually shows
   improvement in vasognic edema and mass-effect.  Concern for new
   metastases, worsening vasogenic edema, or bleed.
   - CT head without contrast when stable
   - cont. dilantin and keppra
   - check dilantin dose
   - increase dexamethasone to 8 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2506**], neurooncologist
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure:  Pt had agonal breathing after return of
   circulation.  Seizure may have caused hypoxia.  There is also concern
   for brainstem metastases.  CXR shows stable ?loculated pleural effusion
   on the right, increased pulm edema.  Pt was admitted for dyspnea, felt
   to be secondary to recurrent malignant pleural effusions.  Pt underwent
   thoracentesis and diuresis via Lasix.  ECHO did not show pericardial
   effusion; no s/sxs of tamponade.  Pt was down to 1L by NC on day of
   transfer.
   - Currently on AC 500x18 with minimal oxygenation support (FiO2 40%,
   PEEP 5), can attempt PS trial during the day and quick extubation as pt
   is able to wake up easily, responded appropriately to family.
   - Continue diuresis as tolerated
   - Consider pleurex catheter
   .
   4.  Metastatic breast cancer:  Per OMR notes, pt is full code,
   requesting chemotherapy, whole brain radiation.
   - Weekly Navelbine
   - Pain control with Fentanyl currently
   .
   .
   5. Sinus Tach:  HR in 120s on the floor as well.  Likely [**1-23**] tumor
   burden +/- pain.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   6. Transaminitis: Stable, slightly down from previous admission, likely
   from known liver mets.
   - Will cont. to monitor LFTs
   .
   7.  Hypertension:
   - Hold home metoprolol as mildy hypotensive, likely [**1-23**] to sedation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the liver, lungs, and brain. The patient was admitted for dyspnea, which was believed to be secondary to recurrent malignant pleural effusions. She underwent thoracentesis and diuresis via Lasix.

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required less than 2 minutes of chest compressions due to hypoxia. She also had a seizure, which may have been caused by brain metastases. Her CT head showed improvement in vasogenic edema and mass-effect, but there is concern for new metastases, worsening vasogenic edema, or bleed. She is currently on sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with agonal breathing after the return of circulation. There is concern for brainstem metastases, and her chest X-ray shows a stable loculated pleural effusion on the right, along with increased pulmonary edema. She is currently on assist-control ventilation (AC 500x18) with minimal oxygenation support (FiO2 40%, PEEP 5) and can attempt pressure support (PS) trial during the day with a goal for quick extubation as she is able to wake up easily and respond appropriately to family.

   3.  Respiratory failure: Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary
   edema, infection (pcp), aspiration secondary to seizure, constrictive
   pericardial physiology vs. worsening PE load. CXR demonstrates
   pulmonary edema.  Pt was admitted for dyspnea, felt to be secondary to
   recurrent malignant pleural effusions.  Pt underwent thoracentesis and
   diuresis via Lasix.  ECHO shows small pericardial effusion; no s/sxs of
   tamponade, however could have constrictive physiology. Attempt
   aggressive diuresis, if does not improve consider cardiology
   involvement for possible constrictive physiologyof pericardium and
   stripping.
   - Aggressive diuresis with IV Lasix (goal  -2 L)
   - mini- BAL for pcp (LDH elevated)
   - CTA for PE
   - CXR today to eval
   - continue on vent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the liver, lungs, and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has known seizure disorder due to brain metastases and is currently on dilantin and keppra. Her mental status is improving today.

The patient's respiratory failure is being evaluated, considering pulmonary edema, infection (PCP), aspiration secondary to seizure, constrictive pericardial physiology, or worsening pulmonary embolism load. A chest X-ray demonstrates pulmonary edema, and an ECHO shows a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. There is a possibility of constrictive pericardial physiology, which may require cardiology involvement for possible pericardium stripping.

The patient has metastatic breast cancer, and the oncology plan includes weekly Navelbine and pain control with Fentanyl. She is also a full code and is requesting chemotherapy and whole brain radiation.

The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely due to tumor burden or pain. She received a 500 cc bolus of IV fluids for hydration and will undergo a CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism. Monitoring on telemetry is ongoing.

The patient has transaminitis, which is stable and likely related to known liver metastases. Her hypertension is being managed, and she is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver, lungs, and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a left pupil larger than the right pupil, indicating possible increased intracranial pressure or brain edema. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 120s, and her blood pressure is on the lower end of normal. Her respiratory rate is slightly elevated, but she is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. 

Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Imaging studies reveal new right lower lobe consolidative opacity consistent with pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and persistent pericardial effusion. 

The patient's medical conditions include a known seizure disorder, respiratory failure, metastatic breast cancer with no options for neuro-oncology or radiation treatment due to metastases, sinus tachycardia, transaminitis, and hypertension. 

The plan moving forward includes weaning off sedation and assessing whether she can be weaned off the ventilator, continuing dexamethasone for vasogenic edema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia and the inability to clear secretions. She has also had reintubation into the right bronchus with left lung collapse, which has since resolved. The patient's seizure disorder is controlled with phenytoin and levetiracetam. Her sinus tachycardia is likely related to tumor burden. The patient's metastatic breast cancer has poor prognosis, and the family wants aggressive care despite the grim outlook. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and the inability to clear secretions. Continued ventilation and daily chest X-rays are recommended to monitor progress.

2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. Phenytoin loading was done last night, and today's therapeutic level is within normal range. Monitoring phenytoin levels and continuing dexamethasone to control vasogenic edema are advised.

3. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 120s at baseline, likely due to tumor burden. Monitoring on telemetry and retrying a fluid bolus to see if tachycardia improves are suggested.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient attempted extubation twice, but was unsuccessful due to tachypnea and inability to clear secretions. She was reintubated both times. A bronchoscopic evaluation revealed that the endotracheal tube was in the right main bronchus, causing collapse of the left lung. The tube was pulled back, and the PEEP was increased to reinflate the left lung.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate in the range of 117-162 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 72-86 mmHg systolic and 50-63 mmHg diastolic, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia or inability to clear secretions during a seizure. She also has a small pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade. The patient failed extubation and required reintubation into the right bronchus with subsequent left lung collapse, which has now resolved on the ventilator. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely due to tumor burden or pain. She has a history of seizure disorder and brain metastases. The patient's prognosis is poor, with metastasis to the liver and brain, and no options for neuro-oncology or radiation treatment. The family wants aggressive care despite the grim prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia or inability to clear secretions during a seizure. Continued ventilation and daily chest X-rays are necessary to monitor her condition.
2. Infection: The sputum culture showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters suggests a possible bacterial infection. Antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro) have been started for possible pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe, a right-sided malignant pleural effusion, and potential constrictive physiology. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

She also has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. Phenytoin has been loaded and is at a therapeutic level. The plan is to continue phenytoin and levetiracetam, monitor phenytoin levels, and follow up with a CT head without contrast to rule out any acute process.

The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which is responsive to intravenous fluids. Pain is controlled, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). Decreased urine output (UOP) has been observed, with a creatinine level of 0.6. The plan is to monitor the patient on tele, provide IV fluid bolus as needed for tachycardia, and continue with pain control using fentanyl.

Regarding her metastatic breast cancer, weekly Navelbine chemotherapy will be continued, along with pain control using fentanyl. The patient's primary onc"

   I have seen and evaluated the patient, reviewed the resident
s note and
   agree with the above with the following additions/emphasis:
   40 year old female with metastatic breast CA to brain and other
   locations now with persistent respiratory failure/vent-dependence.
   Overnight, remains on mechanical ventilation with very poor RSBI of
   170-180
   On exam, is afebrile and relatively hemodynamically stable with
   exception of some persistent tachycardia.
   Awake, alert
   Chest: coarse BS bilaterally
   Cor: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   CXR: bilateral infiltrates R > L
   A:
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure: RSBI remains poor (180s) and I
   checked this myself at bedside. CXR reveals infiltrates which likely
   represent combination of fluid and pneumonia
   2)       Breast Cancer with Mets to brain
   3)       Seizure disorder secondary to brain mets
   Discussion: Held meeting with husband and patient today.  He is very
   insistent that we are keeping the patient intubated for
no good
   reason
 and that she can breathe on her own.  I reviewed the data from
   the weekend which indicated two separate failed extubations (one
   intentional and the other a self-extubation).  I also reviewed current
   RSBI and CXR and conclude that her chances of a successful extubation
   today is minimal.  Her overall prognosis is also quite poor as conveyed
   to me by oncologist who relates that she failed treatment for brain
   met.  Our current plan will be for additional diuresis and optimize
   lung function for attempted extubation in next 24-48 hours.  Will
   re-initiate family discussion if this plan fails to get patient off the
   ventilator.

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a cardiac arrest. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, likely caused by aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. She also has a right-sided malignant effusion and potential constrictive physiology. There is a concern for intravascular fluid overload.

The patient's other medical conditions include a known seizure disorder, sinus tachycardia, transaminitis, and metastatic breast cancer. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a pulseless electrical activity arrest and required less than 2 minutes of chest compressions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate 104 bpm (103-123 bpm), blood pressure 106/67 mmHg (82-128/61-99 mmHg), respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute (12-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (11.0 g/dL), elevated platelet count (189 K/uL), and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST: 43/42, Alk Phos/T Bili: 239/0.7). The patient's electrolyte levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain, admitted to the ICU following seizures and a cardiac arrest. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. There is also a potential malignant effusion on the right side with constrictive physiology, and the patient appears to be intravascularly fluid overloaded.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Diuretics will be attempted today, and daily chest X-rays will be done to monitor progress. The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with phenytoin and levetiracetam, and dexamethasone is being continued for vasogenic edema. The patient's sinus tachycardia is responsive to IV fluids, but there have been concerns about potential pulmonary embolism, which was ruled out by CT angiography.

The patient has metastatic breast cancer and is receiving weekly chemotherapy with Navelbine. Pain control is being achieved with fentanyl, and the oncology team has discussed the patient's grim prognosis with the family. The patient's cardiac arrest occurred on 4/25/2186 and required less than 2 minutes of chest compressions. It was secondary to hypoxia from a seizure. The patient's transaminitis, likely related to her breast cancer metastasis, is downtrending and stable"

","Summary:
- 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and cardiac arrest.
- Currently intubated and sedated.
- Acute respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia and right-sided malignant pleural effusion.
- Seizure disorder with brain metastases; on phenytoin and levetiracetam.
- Sinus tachycardia, possibly related to pain and respiratory distress.
- Metastatic breast cancer with ongoing treatment and pain management.
- Previous PEA arrest secondary to hypoxia from a seizure.
- Transaminitis likely related to breast cancer metastasis, currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to the aspiration pneumonia and potential constrictive physiology caused by the right-sided malignant pleural effusion.
2. Infection: Given the presence of an indwelling arterial line and other lines, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Seizures: The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases, which puts her at risk for recurrent seizures.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient experienced a previous PEA arrest, indicating potential cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring for any signs of arrhythmias or cardiac events is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain, admitted to the ICU following seizures and a cardiac arrest. She is currently intubated and sedated, with respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. There is also a right-sided malignant effusion with potential constrictive physiology. The patient is intravascularly fluid overloaded with pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray. Staphylococcus aureus was identified in the sputum. The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with phenytoin and levetiracetam. Dexamethasone is being continued for vasogenic edema. Sinus tachycardia is present, possibly related to pain or respiratory distress. Metastatic breast cancer treatment includes weekly Navelbine for chemotherapy and pain control with fentanyl. The patient's prognosis is grim, but the family wishes to continue aggressive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Malignant Effusion: The right-sided malignant effusion may cause respiratory compromise and further pulmonary edema.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is intravascularly fluid overloaded, which can result in pulmonary edema and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Seizures: The patient has a known seizure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe (RLL), with thick secretions. She also has a right-sided malignant pleural effusion and potential constrictive physiology. The patient is fluid overloaded, as indicated by the negative fluid balance, and also has pulmonary edema on chest X-ray (CXR) today. Staphylococcus aureus was found in the sputum culture.

2. Seizure: The patient has a known seizure disorder, and brain metastases are suspected as the cause of the seizure. Phenytoin was loaded, and the dose will be increased. Levetiracetam will also be continued. Follow-up phenytoin levels will be monitored, and dexamethasone will be continued at 8 mg for vasogenic edema. A CT scan of the head without contrast showed no acute process.

3. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia with a heart rate responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF) yesterday. Pain control is managed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe (RLL), along with right-sided malignant pleural effusion and potential constrictive physiology. She is also experiencing peripheral edema, pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and intravascular fluid overload. Staphylococcus aureus has been identified in the sputum.

The patient's medical team plans to continue ventilation with the goal of extubation in the near future. Vancomycin will be continued for Staphylococcus aureus, while stopping piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. Diuretics will be attempted today with the goal of achieving negative fluid balance. An interventional procedure will be performed to drain the effusion, and daily chest X-rays will be taken.

In addition, the patient has a history of seizures and is on phenytoin for seizure control. The dose of phenytoin will be increased, and levetiracetam will also be continued. Dexamethasone will be continued at a dose of 8 mg for vasogenic edema.

The patient is currently experiencing sinus tachycardia, which is responsive to intr"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She continues to have thick secretions and is unable to be weaned off pressure support ventilation (PSV) despite treatment of pneumonia, catheter placement for effusion, and aggressive diuresis. MSSA was detected in her sputum on 5/28.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in etiology due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Her creatinine level is 1.6, with a baseline of 0.5. Fe urea is 29. The goal is to achieve euvolemia, and she should receive albumin IV once, monitor creatinine levels, hold off on diuretics for now, and continue with conservative management.

The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. Phenytoin 6 was started on 6/1, likely due to a missed dose (the patient pulled out her oral gastric tube). Phenytoin levels should be followed, rechecked tomorrow, and dexamethasone should be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She also has acute renal failure likely due to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases, and she is on phenytoin for seizure control. She is also being treated for metastatic breast cancer with weekly Navelbine and pain management with fentanyl. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which is most likely secondary to underlying disease and metastasis. She had a PEA arrest on 04/25/2186, requiring less than 2 minutes of chest compressions, and is currently on telemetry. The patient is also showing signs of transaminitis, which is likely due to breast cancer metastases. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from acute respiratory failure due to HAP in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has thick secretions and has been unable to wean off pressure support ventilation (PSV). The presence of MSSA in the sputum suggests a bacterial infection, and she is currently being"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has thick secretions and is unable to be weaned off pressure support ventilation (PSV) despite treatment for pneumonia, catheter placement for effusion, and aggressive diuresis. MSSA was identified in the sputum on 5/28, so she was started on ciprofloxacin. It is planned to continue zosyn/vanc/cipro until culture data from bronchoscopy, if it confirms MSSA, then switch to Nafcillin. Vancomycin should be held until levels normalize. Daily chest X-rays and goal euvolemia are also planned. Propofol will be continued for comfortable sedation as the patient appears slightly uncomfortable but unable to communicate well. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be considered over the weekend if secretions decrease.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in etiology due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Her creatinine level is 1.6, baseline 0.5. Fe urea is 29. The goal is euvolemia, monitoring creatinine levels, holding off"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain.
- She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving propofol and fentanyl infusions.
- She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely due to healthcare-associated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy.
- The patient has thick secretions, and efforts to wean her off pressure support have been unsuccessful despite treatment for pneumonia, catheter placement for effusion, and aggressive diuresis.
- MSSA was identified in her sputum on 5/28. She has been started on ciprofloxacin.
- The plan is to continue zosyn/vanc/cipro until culture data from bronchoscopic procedures are available.
- Vancomycin levels are being monitored, and it will be held until levels normalize.
- Nafcillin may be considered as an alternative to vancomycin (discuss with ID).
- The goal is to achieve euvolemia, check daily medication levels, and obtain daily chest X-rays.
- Weaning of propofol/fentanyl should be done as tolerated.
- Monitoring of pulmonary secretions and slow weaning of pressure support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and brain metastases. Her current medications include zosyn, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, phenytoin, and dexamethasone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is already diagnosed with HAP and is experiencing thick secretions, making it difficult to wean off pressure support ventilation (PSV). The continued presence of MSSA in the sputum culture may require a switch to Nafcillin once confirmed.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.5 to 1.6, indicating a decline in renal function. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting diuretic use will be crucial in managing this condition.

3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder exacerbated by missed doses of phenytoin. Close monitoring of phenytoin levels and regular rechecking of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia (PNA). She also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. The patient has a history of seizures, and her phenytoin levels should be monitored. She is also experiencing anxiety, which is being treated with lorazepam. The patient's family wants aggressive care despite the grim prognosis. Her sinus tachycardia is most likely secondary to underlying disease and metastasis. The patient has a pericardial effusion but no tamponade. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if she develops further pneumonia or if the current infection does not respond to treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if fluid balance is not maintained and if diuretic therapy is not managed appropriately.
3. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder may continue to be a concern, especially if her phenytoin levels are not well-controlled.
4. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may continue to require management, particularly if she experiences increased discomfort or distress.
5. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a cardiac arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She continues to have thick secretions and has not been able to tolerate weaning off pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in origin due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Her sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. She has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on phenytoin. The patient's anxiety has been managed with propofol and versed, but she is now more sedated on versed. She is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to underlying disease and metastasis. The patient's metastatic breast cancer is being managed with ongoing chemotherapy and pain control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if she is unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation or if her underlying lung condition worsens.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not corrected appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further if her fluid balance is not managed properly or if her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a cardiac arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia. She also has acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and a history of seizures. The patient's family wants aggressive care despite the grim prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continues to have thick secretions. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the MSSA infection is not adequately treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased significantly, indicating renal dysfunction. The pre-renal etiology suggests third-spacing and aggressive diuresis as contributing factors. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, likely due to hypovolemia. This condition requires correction with free water boluses to prevent dehydration.
4. Seizures: The patient has a known seizure disorder exacerbated by brain metastases. Monitoring phenytoin levels and continuing dexamethasone therapy for vasogenic edema are essential.
5. Anxiety: The patient was anxious previously and is currently more sedated on versed. Lorazepam can be used for anxiety relief, and sedation should"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, seizure disorder, anxiety, sinus tachycardia, and transaminitis.

Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has become less reactive this morning, and the etiology is unclear. It could be due to the progression of the disease or over-sedation. Further evaluation is needed.

Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has received ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, as well as a 7-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient also needs a tracheostomy, weaning of pressure support, and close monitoring of pulmonary secretions.

Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to pre-renal causes such as third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of serum creatinine and adjustment of medication dosages accordingly are necessary.

Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hypernatremia, which was likely due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a cardiac arrest. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Her mental status is altered, and she is at risk for further deterioration. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, hypernatremia, sinus tachycardia, and transaminitis. She also has a history of seizure disorder and metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases. The patient's prognosis is described as grim due to disease progression and failure of previous chemotherapy and radiation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to MSSA pneumonia and metastatic malignancy. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and tracheostomy may be required. Daily chest X-rays should be performed to monitor pulmonary secretions.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to over-sedation or progression of underlying disease. It is important to differentiate between these two causes to guide further management. Holding fentanyl/midazolam/lorazepam and performing a head CT scan may help in determining the etiology.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin, possibly due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Monitoring creatinine levels and maintaining e"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has thick secretions and is unable to be weaned off pressure support ventilation (PSV) despite treatment for pneumonia (MSSA HAP) and aggressive diuresis. She previously received ciprofloxacin and vancomycin but stopped on June 3rd. Zosyn was completed on day 8, and consideration may be given to linezolid for MSSA, but consultation with an infectious disease specialist is needed. Daily chest X-rays are recommended, and the goal is to wean the patient off pressure support slowly.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels peaked at 1.7, with a baseline of 0.5. The likely cause is pre-renal etiology due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. The goal is to achieve euvolemia, monitor creatinine levels, and dose medications accordingly.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels likely due to hypovolemia. Calculating the free water deficit and providing free water boluses through total fluid (TF) intake is advised.

4. Seizure: The patient has a known seizure"

   I have seen and evaluated the patient, reviewed the resident
s note and
   agree with the above with the following additions/emphasis:
   40 year old female with metastatic breast CA to brain and other
   locations now with persistent respiratory failure/vent-dependence.
   Overnight, no new problems but still having lots of secretions from ETT
   On exam, T 98.1  P 116   BP  106/60  RR 16  SaO2: 98% on mechanical

   Chest: clear bilaterally
   Cor: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   CXR: bilateral infiltrates now with RML collapse
   BAL: Staph Aureus Coag +
   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   a) Continue Zosyn
   b) [**Month (only) 8**] need bronchoscopy for RML collapse
   c) Attempt PS again today but her respiratory status appears worse
   rather than better this morning
   2) Mental Status Change
   - Check Head CT if family consents (yesterday the husband did not allow
   this to occur)
   3) Breast Cancer with Mets to brain: dismal prognosis overall as has
   failed chemotherapy and radiation
   4) Seizure disorder secondary to brain mets
   Family Meeting today at 12:30
   Addendum: Spoke with husband [**Name (NI) 1111**] for approximately 1 hour.  I
   explained that we have tried unsuccessfully for the last 1.5 weeks to
   get patient weaned from ventilator and that if anything the situation
   is worse (ie., RML collapse).  We have tried to get fluid off
   systemically, through tube drainage, and we have treated pneumonia but
   despite this she remains in respiratory failure with poor daily SBTs.
   She has an underlying terminal disease on the top of the other acute
   issues.  I offered to either move toward tracheostomy or move to
   comfort care.  The husband is reluctant to commit to either and stated
   that he wants to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 **].  I am happy to do so
   if there is an accepting physician and this was discussed with him.  He
   is discussing situation with PCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which is likely due to her underlying medical conditions and impending mortality. Lorazepam has been prescribed to manage this symptom.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which has since resolved. This may have been caused by hypovolemia.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, possibly secondary to underlying disease, metastasis, and anxiety. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism.

4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. This may be related to MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. The patient has failed pressure support (PS) and may need tracheostomy.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to pre-renal causes such as third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of creatinine and fluid balance is necessary.

6. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has advanced breast cancer with multiple metastatic lesions."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, seizure disorder, anxiety, sinus tachycardia, peripheral edema, pericardial effusion, and metastatic breast cancer.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's recent medical history includes seizures, PEA arrest, and metastatic breast cancer. She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as piperacillin/tazobactam for MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has also received aggressive diuresis and catheter placement for effusion.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal a pericardial effusion without tamponade.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including anxiety, hypernatremia, ineffective coping, tachycardia, peripheral edema, pericardial effusion without tamponade, respiratory failure (not ARDS), pulmonary edema, seizure without status epilepticus, and metastatic breast cancer.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/70 mmHg to 224/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased creatinine and total bilirubin levels. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with high sodium and low potassium levels.

The patient's recent medical interventions include the removal and replacement of an oral gastric tube, administration of antibiotics for MSSA HAP, catheter placement for effusion, aggressive diuresis, and initiation of medications such as ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, fentanyl, midazol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a cardiac arrest. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is more sedated this morning but seems more alert without sedation. It is unclear whether this change is due to progression of the disease or over-sedation.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, and then switched to piperacillin/tazobactam for MSSA HAP. The patient also has a chest tube catheter placement for effusion and aggressive diuresis. She is currently off antibiotics but may need to restart zosyn for MSSA due to lung collapse and obstructed infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in etiology due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Her creatinine level peaked at 1.7, baseline 0.5, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 29.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain, admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a cardiac arrest. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as well as acute renal failure possibly due to pre-renal causes such as third-spacing and aggressive diuresis.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted spontaneous breaths and has a tracheostomy planned. Her altered mental status is still present, and it is unclear whether this is due to disease progression or over-sedation. She also has a history of seizure disorder and brain metastases.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while other values such as hemoglobin, leukocytes, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from MSSA HAP in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has been treated with Cipro/Vanc and zosyn for MSSA HAP. A chest tube catheter has been placed for effusion and aggressive diuresis. The patient's right lower lobe is collapsed, and she may need a bronchoscopy and reopening of her right middle l"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), breast. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has a tracheostomy planned. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological examination shows left pupil larger than right pupil, and both pupils are reactive. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with decreased creatinine and total bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, followed by zosyn for MSSA HAP. The patient also has pulmonary edema and a collapsed lung, which may contribute to her respiratory distress.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to pre-renal etiology in the setting of third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Her creatinine level peaked at 1.7 mg/dL, with a baseline of 0.5 mg/dL.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient initially presented with hypernatremia, which was likely due to hypovolemia. However, it has since resolved.
4. Seizure: The patient has a known seizure disorder, exacerbated by brain metastases. Phenytoin levels should be monitored, and dexamethasone will be continued for vasogenic edema.
5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which is being managed with lorazepam. However, it is currently held due to altered mental status (AMS).
6. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's underlying metastatic breast cancer is being treated with weekly Navelbine and pain control with fentanyl.
7. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia is most likely secondary to underlying disease and metastasis, possibly exacerbated by anxiety.
8. s/p PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest on [**2186-4-25**] that required less than 2 minutes of chest compressions. It was likely secondary to hypoxia from the seizure.
9. Transaminitis: The patient has stable transaminitis, likely related to her breast cancer metastasis. Liver function tests (LFTs) should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a cardiac arrest. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has been treated with antibiotics for MSSA HAP and chest tube catheter placement for effusion. The patient's altered mental status may be due to progression of disease or over-sedation. She has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal etiology, and her creatinine level is improving. She also has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to HAP. Continuous monitoring and treatment with appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has likely resolved. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is important.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. Monitoring phenytoin levels and providing additional doses as needed are crucial.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely pre-renal etiology. Monitoring creatinine levels and maintaining euvolemia are important.
5. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's prognosis is grim, but the family wants aggressive care. Pain control with fentanyl and continuation of weekly Navelbine therapy should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain, admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and PEEP set at 5 cmH2O. Her blood pressure is 114/76 mmHg, heart rate is 116 beats per minute, and temperature is 37.1 degrees Celsius. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is on phenytoin for seizure control.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure due to suspected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, and previously received zosyn for MSSA HAP. The patient also has altered mental status, which could be attributed to either the progression of her disease or over-sedation. Her seizure disorder is being monitored, and she is on IV phenytoin for seizure control. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to pre-renal etiology, third-spacing, and aggressive diuresis. Her creatinine level peaked at 1.7, but is improving. Other conditions include anxiety,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver and brain. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and intubated. She has a history of seizure disorder and known brain metastases. Her current conditions include acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, seizure disorder, acute renal failure, anxiety, metastatic breast cancer, sinus tachycardia, hypernatremia, and s/p PEA arrest. The patient's prognosis is described as grim due to her underlying disease and metastasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia secondary to metastatic malignancy. There is a concern for pulmonary edema as well.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of MSSA hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for which she received ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. She also had a chest tube catheter placement for effusion, which could increase the risk of infection.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder and brain metastases, making her prone to further seizures.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal acute renal failure due to third-spacing and aggressive diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   40F w metastatic breast cancer to liver and brain, who was admitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] following seizures and PEA arrest.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: had a MSSA HAP in setting of progressive
   metastatic malignancy.  S/p Cipro/Vanc (6/7
 [**6-3**]). S/p zosyn x 7 days
   (6/7
 [**6-4**]) for MSSA HAP. S/p chest tube catheter placement for
   effusion and aggressive diuresis. S/p bronch on [**6-7**]. Was contining on
   zosyn with goal even to slightly negative fluid status. Was continued
   on pleurx drainage. On ventalator  AC, with propofol being weaned.
   Originally had planned on discussion with hospice facilities today per
   results of family discussion. But then had events stated above
   resulting in expiration at 1430.
   # Altered Mental Status: Since Monday had appeared to have an altered
   mental status. There was concern in an elargment or bleed in her brain
   mets. However, after discussion with husband, he refused CT head scan.
   Then today during the events leading up to expriation, there was again
   concern for a brainstem process such as possible herniation. She had
   lost her reflexes at approxiamately 11:30AM.
   # Seizure:  Known seizure disorder [**1-23**] brain metastases. Did not appear
   to be having a seizure today. Phenytonin level had been increased and
   when adjusted for albumin today was 9.5.
   # Acute Renal Failure: was improving.
   # Social Family issues:  Attending had a family meeting with ethics
   yestarday to discuss options. Pt
s husband had [**Name2 (NI) 7175**] to consider
   hospice options. During the pt
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4**] stay there had been concern over
   the husband
s interactions with the staff. He had expressed some
   paranoia and distress over the care of his wife. There had been repeat
   familiy meetings with the husband and the attending to listien to his
   concerns and explain her cousre. There had been daily efforts to try to
   wean the vent, but had been unsucessful. The husband wanted transfer of
   his wife to [**Name (NI) **], but there was not an accepting physcian available
   there. Today after death of patient, husband expressed his appreciation
   to the staff.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU following seizures and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient had multiple medical complications and conditions throughout her stay in the ICU.

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient had a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the setting of progressive metastatic malignancy. She received treatment with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for MSSA HAP. She also had a chest tube catheter placement for an effusion and aggressive diuresis.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient had an altered mental status since Monday, with concerns of possible intracranial bleeding or brain metastases. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was refused by the patient's husband, and there were concerns for a brainstem process such as possible herniation during the events leading up to expiration.

3. Seizure: The patient had a known seizure disorder and brain metastases. She did not appear to be having a seizure today, and her phenytoin level had been increased and adjusted for albumin.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient was improving in terms of renal function.
