   ABDOMINAL PAIN
   FEVER
   ANEMIA
   HYPOTENSION
   Patient continues to have abdominal pain without evidence of obstuction
   on ERCP. With alk phos coming down, possible that the patient passed a
   stone. C diff is positive from S [**Hospital **] hospital and CT this AM suggests
   thickening of bowel wall. Will consult surgical service.
   Metabolic acidosis likely due to several factors: small anion gap
   (given low albumin), bicarb losses in stool, and dilution of bicarb
   with normal saline fluids.
   Dyspnea may be due to large effusions, need to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis, and possibly some capillary leak due to low albumin;
   stimulation of stretch receptors in atelectatic lung may also be
   contributing. Gas exchange is good. If symptoms worsen, consider
   thoracentesis. Pleural effusions are chronic, not likely infected. If
   tapped, will need to watch for re-expansion pulmonary edema.
   BP has been more stable, although tachycardia continues. Continue
   fluids as needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. The patient has fever, abdominal pain, hypotension, acidosis, and anemia. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, which did not show any obstruction in the biliary system. However, the patient continues to experience abdominal pain and bands persist on the white blood cell differential.

The patient requires intermittent fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure, and urine output is acceptable in the morning with normal creatinine levels. Oxygen saturation is within an acceptable range with supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and latex, and they were unable to provide their medical history due to encephalopathy. They received antibiotics (levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) overnight.

The patient is on various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and haloperidol (Haldol). They also have fentanyl patches, multivitamins, and thiamine.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 121-153 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/88 mmHg to 96/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 3,839 mL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and fatigue, and received 10-11 liters of intravenous fluids. He was changed from assisted control ventilation to pressure support ventilation and appears comfortable with good oxygenation. The patient is sedated and intubated. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 103/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, severe retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, multiple sclerotic bony lesions in the vertebral bodies and iliac wings bilaterally, and pneumobilia status post ERCP. He has a history of colon cancer and is receiving palliative chemotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. It is important to monitor his oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can lead to decreased lung expansion and impaired gas exchange. Further evaluation and management are required.
3. Obstructive ch"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with PMHx of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma who presented with
   leukocytosis, abnormal LFTs and diffuse Cdiff positive diarrhea.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt presented with leukocytosis, SOB, diarrhea and LFTs
   suggestive of worsening obstructive cholestasis.  Now s/p ERCP with
   replacemt of stent but no clear evidence of prior stent obstruction.
   LFTs trending down and pt has remained afebrile. He received
   levo/flagyl and 4-5L of IVF prior to transfer.  He was notably Cdiff
   positive and has had >1L liquid stool output since arrival to IVU.  He
   is afebrile and mildly confused, complaining of mild abd pain thought
   denying SOB. Bandemia initially resolved on repeat CBC, now recurrent
   bandemia and worsening acidosis concerning for severe CDiff.  Abd exam
   benign and KUB with dilated bowel loops, no evidence of free air.
   - continue Levo/Flagyl for possible obstructive cholangitis
   - add Vanc for empiric coverage of ?HAP with levo/flagyl

   # Metabolic Acidosis: Pt with elevated anion gap of 16 with mildly
   elevated lactate at 2.5. He has significant stool output and ongoing
   bicarb loss and he has been resuscitated with NS IVF resulting in mild
   hyperchloremia.  Suspect this is a combined gap & non-gap acidosis,
   will plan to continue IVF boluses with LR and replace bicarb loss in
   stool with D5 with 150meq of bicarb
   - IVF with D5 with 3 amps bicarb at 150cc/hr
   - trend lactate & ABGs
   - send urine for ketones
   - trend BMP q8hrs

   # Tachycardia: Etiology unclear, does not seem to be responding to IVF
   boluses.  Pt has remained afebrile and CTA was negative for PE at [**Hospital **]. Concern for SIRS/Sepsis given Cdiff and signficant leukocytosis
   with bandemia. JVP is not visible and heart sounds clear, low suspician
   for pericardial effusion
   - bolus IVF with LR prn
   - f/u echo in am
   - trend HR
   - get CT abd to r/o colitis/megacolon

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent replacement due to obstructive cholestasis, but no clear evidence of prior stent obstruction was found. He received levo/flagyl and 4-5 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) prior to transfer. The patient is currently afebrile and mildly confused, complaining of mild abdominal pain but denying shortness of breath (SOB). Bandemia initially resolved on repeat complete blood count (CBC), now recurrent bandemia and worsening acidosis are concerning for severe C. diff. The abdominal exam is benign, and kidney/urinary bladder (KUB) imaging shows dilated bowel loops without evidence of free air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient presented with leukocytosis, which suggests an infection or inflammation. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap with mildly elevated lactate levels, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. This could be due to bicarbonate loss through significant stool output and ongoing resuscitation with normal saline IVF resulting in mild hyperchlo"

   Patient has done well on the ventilator overnight. Will reduce FIO2.
   Suspect that he may have tired from sleep deprivation and the acute
   illness. He is managing on minimal vent support now. Will reduce
   sedation and, if he continues to do well, will extubate. If he has
   problems off sedation or gets more uncomfortable post extubation, would
   tap effusions.
   Improved heart rate suggests that we may be catching up with
   intravascular volume and that third spacing may be slowing down.
   Normallization of lactate level also consistent with better overall
   perfusion. Continue to support with fluids. If serum bicarb drops below
   20, would use one liter of D5W with 3 amps of bicarbonate.
   Hct drfiting down slightly. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion
   threshold.
   Continue treatment for C diff. Stool is still copious.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. They have C. difficile colitis, acute respiratory failure, pleural effusions, and anemia. The patient is receiving fluids and being supported on the ventilator. There is a concern about the patient's mental status, possibly due to sleep deprivation and acute illness. The plan is to reduce sedation and potentially extubate the patient if they continue to do well. If there are any problems off sedation or discomfort post-extubation, the healthcare team may decide to tap the effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has signs of infection and altered mental status, which could progress to sepsis with organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be indicative of delirium, which can be a complication in critically ill patients.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support.
4. Pleural effusions: The presence of pleural effusions suggests potential complications such as pneumonia or cardiac issues.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or acute blood loss. It needs to be addressed to improve oxygen carrying capacity and overall health.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient has C. difficile colitis, a common and serious complication of antibiotic use. It requires specific treatment to prevent further complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia, sepsis, tachycardia, mental status changes, obstructive cholestasis, and metastatic adenocarcinoma.

During the past 24 hours, the patient experienced several events. He was extubated but later became short of breath (SOB), tachycardic, and agitated. Ativan 0.5mg and fentanyl 25-50mcg q6h were administered to help decrease work of breathing (WOB). The patient began to desaturate on 6L nasal cannula, with increased agitation, so a nebulizer and haloperidol were given. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a PO2 of 49, although the oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 94% on 6L NC. There was no change in the electrocardiogram (EKG). Increased infiltrate/effusion in the right lung was noted, but no fever spike was observed. Blood cultures and urinalysis/urology cultures were sent. The patient received vancomycin and aztreonam due to the concern"

   # Respiratory failure
 most likely due to tiring /sleep deprivatoin
   from acute illness or may be due to pleural effusion. Pt doing well on
   ventilator with little support.
   -If O2 sats do well on FiO2=35%, will decrease sedation and extubate
   -if no improvement with extubation, will consider extubation
   -f/u CXR; repeat tomorrow

   # Leukocytosis: Resolved. Pt now afebrile. C diff negative here but was
   positive at OSH. LFTs suggest worsening obstructive cholestasis. CT
   [**Last Name (un) 42**] negative for toxic megacolon.
   - continue Levo/Flagyl for possible obstructive cholangitis

   bicarbonate.
   - trend lactate & ABGs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Etiology unclear, but does respond to IVF boluses
   suggesting intravascular depletion. Pt has remained afebrile and CTA
   was negative for PE at [**Hospital3 **].
   - bolus IVF with NS prn
   - trend HR

   # Obstructive cholestasis: s/p ERCP with stent replaced.  Per ERCP
   report, their was no clear obstruction and prior stent was patent.
   Tbili trended down slightly after stenting.  Unclear if this was true
   precipitant of leukocytosis and transient hypotension
   - trend LFTs, lipase, amylase post ERCP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea.

The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure, most likely due to fatigue or sleep deprivation from the acute illness or possible pleural effusion. He is doing well on the ventilator with minimal support. The plan is to decrease sedation and extubate if oxygen saturation (O2) levels remain stable on FiO2=35%. If there is no improvement, consideration will be given to extubation.

The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and he is now afebrile. Although C. diff was negative at the current hospital, it was positive at the previous hospital. The liver function tests suggest worsening obstructive cholestasis. A computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for toxic megacolon. The plan is to continue levofloxacin (Levo) and metronidazole (Flagyl) for possible obstructive cholangitis. Additionally, vancomycin (Vanco) and intravenous Flagyl will be continued for C. diff.

The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, with decreased lactate levels and decreased anion gap (AG). He received significant amounts of bicarbonate. The plan is to continue intravenous fluids"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea. The patient was extubated but experienced shortness of breath (SOB), agitation, and desaturation on 6 liters nasal cannula. He was placed on a nebulizer and received haloperidol. The patient's right lung showed increased infiltrate/effusion, and he was given IV vancomycin and aztreonam due to concern for worsening pneumonia. The patient's heart rate (HR) has been consistently elevated, and he has received various medications for SOB and increasing oxygen requirements. His mental status remains agitated and delirious. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent replacement and is currently experiencing increasing alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels. He has stage IV metastatic adenocarcinoma and is receiving palliative chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirements and desaturation indicate possible pulmonary edema due to fluid overload.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's leukocytosis has resolved, he remains at risk for sepsis, especially considering his positive C. diff history and ongoing"

   ==========================
   Chest xray shows increasing evidence of volume overload. During his
   exam, patient did valsalva maneuver and transiently broke to NSR with
   rate 80 and then went back to his tachycardia, thus, tachycardia likely
   represents SVT rather than response to intravascular volume.. Creat is
   0.4 and BUN is not elevated. Will begin diuresis with lasix infusion
   and treat tachycardia with beta blockers.
   Continue antibiotics. WBC still rising.
   Continues to have small anion gap acidosis.
   Bilirubin elevated today; will notify ERCP team.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory distress, C. Diff infection, and pleural effusions. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, high blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. They also have altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes. The patient is receiving various medications, including diuretics for fluid management, antibiotics for infection, and beta blockers for tachycardia. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, presence of infection (C. Diff), and systemic signs of illness suggest a potential severe infection leading to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Acute kidney injury: Elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can be a complication of severe infection or volume overload.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and the need for respiratory support may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and history of SVT suggest a potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can be exacerbated by electrolyte imbalances or infections.
5. Organ dysfunction: Given the patient's multiple organ dysfunctions (res"

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma.
- He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse C. difficile positive diarrhea.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxia, sepsis, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, upper extremity edema, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), altered mental status, obstructive cholestasis, and metastatic adenocarcinoma.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
- He is receiving multiple medications including furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin sodium for thrombosis prophylaxis, metoprolol for tachycardia, and haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation.
- The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI).
- He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent replacement due to obstructive cholestasis.
- The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and he is currently on full code status.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea.

The patient's current conditions and plans include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirements have been increasing overnight, likely due to pulmonary edema caused by fluid administration over the past few days. Lasix drip with a goal urine output of 300cc/hr has been initiated to address this issue. Morphine has been ordered every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath (SOB), and fentanyl has been discontinued. If the patient starts to tire, intubation may be considered.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient remains afebrile, leukocytosis is still increasing. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli. Antibiotic treatment includes Levofloxacin for possible obstructive cholangitis, Flagyl for uncomplicated UTI, and continued vancomycin and Aztreonam until hypoxia improves and cultures return. Blood and urine cultures, as well as lactate trends, will be monitored.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate decreases with carotid massage and valsalva maneuver, indicating that tachycardia is not due to"

   =====================
   Patient very uncomfortable this AM. Because of TPN and antibiotics, we
   have been unable to achieve negative fluid balance. I am concerned
   about giving him no nutirion for days (especially with albumin at 2.1),
   and about a sudden decompensation as his fatigue and mental status
   deteriorate. Will proceed with elective intubation. Place OG tube for
   feeding given that his diarrhea has improved indicative of resolving
   colitis. Will stop antibiotics for possible pneumonia; cultures have
   been negative and patient has been afebrile. Resend sputum culture/gram
   stain after intubation.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Platelet counts dropping. Will check HIT antibody. Heparin was stopped.
   Metabolic acidosis has resolved.
   LDH rising for unclear reasons. Checking for hemolysis. Doubt PCP at

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and pleural effusions. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with some improvement in diuresis but ultimately showing positive fluid balance over the 24-hour period. Oxygen saturation levels have worsened overnight, leading to increased respiratory distress. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation and has received multiple antibiotics. There are concerns about providing nutrition due to TPN and antibiotics, as well as the risk of sudden decompensation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation suggests an ongoing infection, which may lead to sepsis if not promptly managed.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is deteriorating, indicating a potential neurological complication.
3. Tachycardia, other: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis): The patient's history of antibiotic use and improvement in diarrhea suggests a possible C. diff infection.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's blood gas analysis shows a decreased TCO2 level, indicating metabolic acidosis.
6. Acute respiratory distress: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels suggest a possible respiratory complication.
7. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. The patient presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse C. difficile positive diarrhea.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/resp distress, intubated and weaned from 60% to 40% FiO2, tolerated well, saturating in high 90s. The most likely cause of this is pulmonary edema due to IV fluid overload. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) was turned off at 9 am this morning, and the patient had a Lasix drip with a goal urine output (UOP) of 300 cc/hr and a negative fluid balance of 2 liters.

The patient also has hypotension/sepsis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.9 today. The patient was hypotensive with systolic blood pressures (SBPs) in the 80-90s overnight, and an arterial line was placed for better monitoring. Although the patient tested negative for C. difficile in the ICU, he had a positive test at the outpatient surgical hospital (OSH). The patient also has an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). Diarrhea has decreased, indicating improving colitis.

The plan includes continuing Levofloxacin (Levo) and Flagyl for possible obstructive cholangitis"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse C. difficile positive diarrhea. The patient was initially intubated due to hypoxia and respiratory distress, which was most likely caused by pulmonary edema from IV fluid overload. His current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia/Resp Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation improved after being placed on non-invasive ventilation and then intubation. Ventilator settings were adjusted to FiO2 35%, RR 16, and PEEP 5. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was ordered to assess oxygenation on the new ventilator settings. The patient's sedation was switched from fentanyl/versed to propofol.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient has been hypotensive with systolic blood pressures (SBPs) in the 70s-90s overnight. An arterial line was placed for better blood pressure monitoring. The patient tested positive for E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) at another facility but was negative in the ICU. Diarrhea has been improving. 

   - PO flagyl and levo were switched back to IV as it is thought that perhaps PO meds are not being adequately absorbed from the GI tract, worsening the sepsis"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, C. Diff colitis, and anemia. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with improvements in oxygenation and a somewhat improved chest X-ray on the left side. However, there have been difficulties with diuresis, possibly due to low blood pressure. The patient is not on high doses of sedation, and the cause of the blood pressure problem is unclear. Antibiotics have been switched back to IV, as the WBC count is still coming down, and diarrhea is improving. The patient is afebrile, and albumin will be given followed by lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1.0 L. If this is unsuccessful, a small dose of levphed will be considered to increase systolic blood pressure to 110 and see if it enables an increase in urine output. The patient's Hct is stable, and they are not at the transfusion threshold. Metabolic acidosis has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing infection and elevated WBC count indicate a potential risk for sepsis.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status may continue to be affected by their critical condition and sedation.
3. Tachycardia, other: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, which could be a response to infection, low blood"

   64 y/o M with PMHx of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma who presented with
   leukocytosis, abnormal LFTs and diffuse Cdiff positive diarrhea.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Resp Distress
 intubated on AC, weaned to 35% FiO2,
   tolerated well, saturating in high 90s.  Most likely due to pulmonary
   edema [**12-18**] IVF overload.  TPN switched to tube feeds to reduce volume of
   intake.  Neg 1 L this AM but still +19 L for hospital stay.  SBT on
   rounds with RSBI 26.  Will plan to hold TFs for the next 6 hours,
   diurese to -500cc and do another SBT in 6 hours.
   - SBT with RSBI at 5pm
   - holding TFs pending above
   - weaning proprofol sedation
   #Leukocytosis: WBC 13.2 with unclear etiology.  Hypotensive to SBPs of
   90-110s overnight.  Pt has been C diff negative here but was positive
   at OSH. Diarrhea has been improving. Pt with E. Coli UTI on admission
   but cleared on [**6-22**] urine cx.
   - PO flagyl and levo switched back to IV, thought process being that
   perhaps perhaps PO meds not being adequately absorbed from GI tract,
   - Bactrim DS PO for uncomplicated UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - trend lactates
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   # Fluid Overload/UE edema
 Pt with b/l UE edema, R>L. It is in
   dependent areas and is most likely from his fluid overload.
   - diuresis to goal of -1-2 L today
   -will administer albumin today and follow with lasix bolus
   - possible Echo tomorrow to eval for cardiomyopathy given persistent
   tachy and new gallop on exam
   .
   # Tachycardia: most likely due to SVT
   - Lopressor held for hypotension
   -improved with profolol to HR low 100s
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets have decreased from admission. Heparin
   d/c
d with mild improvement in plt from 70 ->90. Now 81.  HIT antibody
   pending.
   - f/u HIT antibody
   - f/u plt and monitor for bleeding
   - pneumoboots
   .
   # Hemolysis: Haptoglobin <20, increased t bili (awaiting fractionation)
   , 2+ schistocytes on peripheral smear, hct steadily dropping since
   admission, thrombocytopenia, increased LDH.
   - heme consult
   - check urine for hemoglobin
   -must consider possible TTP given anemia, thrombocytopenia, AMS
   .
   # Mental status
Cannot assess as pt is intubated and sedated.
   Previously pt agitated and delirius, most likely due to combination of
   sepsis and hypoxia
   -treat above
   -Haldol q6h: PRN agitation
   -Wife sits with pt to help with re-orientation
   .
   # Obstructive cholestasis: s/p ERCP with stent replaced.  Pt now with
   stable elevated alk phos and T. bili increased this am. ERCP fellow
   following peripherally
   -Continue levo/flagyl for biliary infection
   - total 7 day course of levo, tomorrow is day 7
   -Trend LFTs
   .
   # Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: Pt with stage IV adenocarcinoma currently
   receiving palliative chemo from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7551**], last dose approx 4wks ago.
   - stable per outpt oncologist
   - continue fentanyl patch 12mcg q 72hr for pain
   - oxycodone 5mg prn breakthrough

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia/resp distress, most likely caused by pulmonary edema secondary to IV fluid overload. 

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with an unclear etiology. He is also experiencing hypotension with blood pressures ranging from 90-110 mmHg. The patient had a previous C. diff infection but is currently negative. He also had an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) on admission but has since cleared it.

The patient has bilateral upper extremity (UE) edema, which is most likely due to fluid overload. Diuretics have been initiated to manage this condition. Additionally, there is a suspicion of cardiomyopathy given the persistent tachycardia and new gallop on examination, and an echocardiogram has been ordered.

The patient's platelet count has decreased from admission levels. Heparin was discontinued due to the development of mild improvement in platelet count. HIT antibodies are pending, and the patient's platelet count and vital signs are being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding.

There are indications of hemolysis, including low"

   tolerated well, saturating in high 90s.  Most likely due to pulmonary
   edema [**12-18**] IVF overload.  TPN switched to tube feeds to reduce volume of
   intake.
   - decrease vent settings to FiO2 35%, RR 16, PEEP 5
   - ABG to assess oxygenation on new vent settings
   - switch fentanyl/versed sedation to proprofol
   #Hypotension/Sepsis: WBC 14.9 today.  Hypotensive to SBPs of 70s-90s
   overnight, A-line placed for better BP monitoring.  Pt has been C diff
   negative here but was positive at OSH. Pt with E. Coli UTI. Diarrhea
   has been improving.
   - PO flagyl and levo switched back to IV, thought process being that
   perhaps perhaps PO meds not being adequately absorbed from GI tract,
   worsening sepsis picture
   - change to Bactrim DS PO for uncomplicated UTI
   - f/u blood/urine cx
   - trend lactates
   - consider levophed for BP control since propofol and diuresis will
   likely bring down BP even further

   # Fluid Overload/UE edema
 Pt with b/l UE edema, R>L. It is in
   dependent areas and is most likely from his fluid overload.
   -will administer albumin today and follow with lasix bolus

   # Tachycardia: most likely due to SVT
   - Lopressor held for hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and diffuse C. difficile positive diarrhea. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. The goal is to maintain oxygenation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been hypotensive and shows signs of infection, including leukocytosis and a positive E. coli urinary tract infection. Antibiotics have been administered, and blood cultures are pending.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is agitated and delirious, likely due to sepsis and hypoxia. Sedation with propofol has been initiated, and reorientation techniques are being used.

4. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing a sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to sepsis. Lopressor was held for hypotension but may need to be restarted once blood pressure stabilizes.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 138 at admission to 70, suggesting possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin has been discontinued, and HIT antibody testing is"

   Oxygenation much improved with diuresis. On rounds we placed him on PSV
   5/0 and the RSBI was 26. Will stop tube feeds and do formal SBT later
   this afternoon. Diruese another 0.5 L negative over the next 6 hours.
   Blood pressure requiring support of norepi while on propofol and lasix
   infusion. Still no other evidence for worsening infection/sepsis as an
   alternative cause of hypotension. Cardiac gallop present today.
   Consider repeat of echo tomorrow.
   Evidence of hemolysis now. With decreasing platelet count as well and
   mild renal insufficiency, as well as agitation, consideration of TTP.
   Will ask heme service to consult. HIT antibody is pending.
   C diff appears to be resolving. Day 6 of levofloxacin.
   Hct at 25. Not at transfusion threshold.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), but it has been ruled out by the physician.

2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, as indicated by the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. However, there is no mention of organ dysfunction at this time.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is sedated and unable to follow commands or be attentive. This altered mental status is likely due to propofol infusion and may be contributing to the patient's agitation.

4. Tachycardia, other: The patient has a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 121 to 139 beats per minute. Other causes of tachycardia need to be evaluated.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been treated with antibiotics, which are common risk factors for C. diff infection. The infection appears to be resolving.

6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's blood gases show a slightly elevated TCO2 level, indicating metabolic acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and C. difficile-positive diarrhea. The patient has been intubated and remains sedated, but there is a plan for extubation tomorrow. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/76 mmHg to 92/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with a decreased fibrinogen level. 

Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube in place, with improvement in the left lung fields. There is no evidence of billiard dilation or obstruction on the abdominal ultrasound. 

The patient's conditions and plans include hypoxia/respiratory distress, hypotension, leukocytosis, fluid overload/upper extremity edema, tachycardia, hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, obstructive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions several significant events.

Firstly, the patient remains intubated overnight with plans for extubation tomorrow. They have been NPO (nothing by mouth) after midnight. The patient experienced high residuals around 5 pm after holding TF (likely tube feeding) for 6 hours. This indicates potential issues with digestion or absorption of nutrients.

Secondly, the patient has low haptoglobin, low fibrinogen, and high FDP levels, which are concerning for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The decision was made to wait and reassess tomorrow before considering plasmapheresis (heme consulted).

Thirdly, the patient has exceeded the negative fluid balance goal for today, with a total negative fluid balance of 2.5 liters. This indicates that the patient may be dehydrated or has been receiving excessive amounts of fluids.

The patient is on assisted ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The respiratory support parameters are being closely monitored.

In terms of medications, the patient is receiving norepinephrine at"

   this looks good. Fluid balance today should again be 1-1.5 L negative.
   Renal function has been stable. Electrolytes good except for need for
   potassium supplementation with ongoing diuresis.
   Will try to stop levophed after propofol stopped and patient extubated.
   If tachycardia persists will start diltiazem.
   Hct down slightly. Platelets stable. Fibrinogen dropping; will recheck
   and monitor for threshold for giving cryoprecipitate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS): The patient's low platelet count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia suggest a possible diagnosis of TTP/HUS. This condition is characterized by blood clots forming throughout the body, leading to organ damage.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate respiratory failure. This condition occurs when the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygenation or remove carbon dioxide from the body.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The presence of infection markers (elevated white blood cell count) and systemic symptoms suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's sedation and inability to provide a history point towards altered mental status. It is important to differentiate between delirium and other forms of altered mental status, as the management may vary.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. The cause of tachycardia needs to be identified and managed accordingly.

6. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis): The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest an infection with Clo"

 extubated yesterday, saturating well on 2L
   NC.  Will monitor closely for signs of respiratory distress
   .
   # Hypotension
 Pt remains off levophed with SBPs in 90s-100s.  Will
   closely monitor BP as we continue to try and diurese pt due to volume
   overload.
   - will give 1 U pRBC today for anemia, but also will help with
   hypotension by increasing intravascular osmotic pressure to help draw
   fluid out of extravascular spaces
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Unclear etiology. Pt has been C diff negative here but
   was positive at OSH. Diarrhea has been improving. Pt with E. Coli UTI
   on admission but cleared on [**6-22**] urine cx.
   - continue PO vancomycin on strong suspicion of C diff
   - f/u blood cx
   - trend lactates
   .
   # Fluid Overload/UE edema
 Pt with b/l UE edema, R>L. It is in
   dependent areas and is most likely from his fluid overload.
   - diuresis to goal of -500cc-1L today, making sure that patient does
   not get more hypotensive.
   .
   # Tachycardia: most likely due to SVT, intravascular volume depletion.
   Albumin 2.5 today
   - decrease metoprolol to 5mg q6
   - give 1 unit pRBC today to help with intravascular volume status and
   anemia
   .
   # Hemolysis: Heme consulted yesterday for haptoglobin <20, increased t
   bili, 2+ schistocytes on peripheral smear, hct steadily dropping since
   admission, thrombocytopenia, increased LDH.  Considered TTP with plasma
   pheresis treatment but low fibrinogen and FDP inconsistent.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   smoldering DIC.  Cryoprecipitate give yesterday for fibrinogen of 87,
   which improved to 140.  Fibrinogen 101 this AM.
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - monitor fibrinogen q6 and give cryo if <100
   - transfuse to goal of hct>21
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets have decreased from admission. Heparin
   d/c
d with mild improvement in plt from 70 ->90.  HIT antibody
   negative.  Does not fit TTP picture as patient has normal renal
   functions.
   - f/u plt and monitor for bleeding, transfuse platelets for goal of plt
   > 20

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), and diffuse Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive diarrhea.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxia/Resp Distress: The patient was extubated yesterday and is saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. He will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress.

2. Hypotension: The patient remains off levophed with stable blood pressures in the 90s-100s. Close monitoring of blood pressure will continue as we attempt to diurese the patient due to volume overload. One unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) will be given today for anemia and to help increase intravascular osmotic pressure, drawing fluid out of extravascular spaces.

3. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear. The patient was C. diff negative in the ICU but positive at outside hospital (OSH). Diarrhea has been improving. The patient had an E. Coli urinary tract infection (UTI) on admission, which cleared on [**6-22**] urine culture. Vancomycin will continue to be administered orally on suspicion of C. diff. Blood cultures will be followed up, and lactate levels will be trended.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and C. difficile positive diarrhea. The patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress but is now extubated with a Respiratory Support Index (RSBI) of 20, indicating low oxygenation requirements and good oxygen saturation.

2. Hypotension: The patient remains on levophed for hypotension, especially during propofol sedation. His blood pressure responds when sedation is weaned but dips with increased sedation.

3. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, but the patient was previously C. difficile positive. He also had an E. coli urinary tract infection on admission, which has since cleared.

4. Fluid Overload/UE Edema: The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which is likely due to fluid overload. Diuresis is being given to achieve a goal of -1 to -2 liters today.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is most likely secondary to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Diltiazem may be considered for control after discontinuing propofol.

6. Hemolysis: The patient exhibits signs of hem"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If not managed properly, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium difficile. If not treated effectively, this infection can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show decreased fibrinogen levels and thrombocytopenia, indicating a possible coagulation disorder. DIC is a serious condition that can lead to widespread bleeding and organ damage if not managed promptly.

4. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) / Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): The patient's low platelet count, along with other symptoms, suggests a possible diagnosis of TTP or HUS. These conditions can lead to organ damage, including kidney failure, if not treated appropriately.

5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is still at risk for sepsis, which is a systemic response to infection. If the infection is not controlled, it can progress"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma who presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and positive C. difficile diarrhea. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Hemolysis: The patient is experiencing hemolysis with an unknown cause. Fibrinogen levels are low, and toe cyanosis was noted, raising concerns for septic emboli or clots. However, the patient's distal pulses are intact.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission. HIT antibody test is negative, and the patient does not fit the picture of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient should be monitored for bleeding and transfused with platelets to maintain a goal of >20,000/mm3.

3. Delirium: The patient is non-verbal, minimally follows commands, and has occasional nods. He had a negative head CT two days ago but no change in mental status since coming off the ventilator. The cause of altered mental status may be due to toxic metabolic etiology, infection, medications, mini disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) emboli, or underlying cancer. An MRI is planned today to help evaluate the situation.

4. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma, presenting with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Resp Distress: The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently saturating well on 2L nasal cannula oxygen. Close monitoring for signs of respiratory distress is recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains off levophed with stable blood pressures in the 90s-100s. Closely monitor BP as we continue to try and diurese the patient due to volume overload. One unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) will be given today for anemia and to help increase intravascular osmotic pressure.
3. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear. The patient was previously C. diff negative but positive at OSH. Diarrhea has been improving, and the patient has an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) that cleared on [**6-22**] urine culture. Continue PO vancomycin on suspicion of C. diff. Follow up with blood culture and trend lactates.

   ============================
   Respiratory status stable. Will try off of supplemental oxygen today.
   Continue to maintain negative fluid balance, goal of 0.5-1.0 L today.
   Hemodynamically stable. Short run of probable Vtach yesterday (started
   with apparent fusion beat), likely related to electrolyte deficiency.
   Potassium being repleted.
   Patient remains non-communicative although nods head in an appropriate
   way intermittently. Tracks to voice. Fentanyl patch removed yesterday.
   He is not receiving sedation. No evidence of seizure activity. Will
   obtain MRI today. Concern with DIC whether he may be having
   mico-clotting in brain. Will ask heme consult to comment on possible
   heparin therapy.
   Patient afebrile but WBC rising. Checking cultures.
   Hct down slightly today. Hemolysis seems to be ongoing with rising bili
   and LDH.

   64 y/o M with PMHx of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma who presented with
   leukocytosis, abnormal LFTs and diffuse Cdiff positive diarrhea.
   .
   # Hemolysis: Pt currently in DIC with unknown cause, likely due to
   metastatic colon cancer.  Pt has consistently low fibrinogen and FDP
   requiring cryoprecipitate.  Heme is following.  Suspicions for TTP is
   lower with ADAMTS13 being 68.  Toe cyanosis noted, concerns for septic
   emboli or clots but DPs intact
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - monitor fibrinogen q6 and give cryo if <100
   - transfuse to goal of hct>21
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets have been decreasing since admission,
   likely due to DIC. HIT antibody negative.  Does not fit TTP picture as
   patient has normal renal functions and ADAMTS13 is low normal
   - f/u plt and monitor for bleeding, transfuse platelets for goal of plt
   > 20
   - pneumoboots
   .
   # Delirium
 Patient is currently non-verbal and minimally follows
   commands.  Able to track with his eyes and occasionally nods yes or
   no.  Had neg head CT two days ago but no change in mental status since
   coming off the vent.  AMS may be due to toxic metabolic etiology,
   infection, meds, mini DIC emboli or underlying cancer.  Toxic metabolic
   unlikely and cx have been neg since positive admission urine cx.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Unclear etiology. Pt has been C diff negative here but
   was positive at OSH. Diarrhea has been improving. Pt with E. Coli UTI
   on admission but cleared on [**6-22**] urine cx.   Sending CRP to help with
   eval as well.  Now has stage 2 pressure ulcer on back but does not
   appear infected.
   - continue PO vancomycin on strong suspicion of C diff
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   .
   # Hypotension
 Improved after decreasing metoprolol yesterday.  Will
   closely monitor BP as we continue to try and diurese pt due to volume
   overload.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Fluid Overload/UE edema
 Pt with b/l UE edema, R>L. It is in
   dependent areas and is most likely from his fluid overload.  Off lasix
   drip, plan to do lasix boluses to achieve goal below.
   - diuresis to goal of -500cc-1L today, making sure that patient does
   not get more hypotensive.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Questionable short run of Vtach yesterday that
   spontaneously resolved.  Otherwise tachy most likely due to SVT,
   intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue to monitor
   - replete lytes as needed
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma. He presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and diffuse C. diff positive diarrhea. The patient is currently in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with unknown cause, likely due to metastatic colon cancer. He has consistently low fibrinogen and FDP levels, requiring cryoprecipitate. There are suspicions for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but toe cyanosis is noted, causing concerns for septic emboli or clots. The patient's platelets have been decreasing since admission, likely due to DIC. HIT antibody is negative, and the patient does not fit the TTP picture as he has normal renal functions and ADAMTS13 is low normal. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): The patient has suspicions for TTP due to low platelet count and toe cyanosis. Close monitoring of symptoms and laboratory values is necessary.
2. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): The patient's presentation with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and diffuse C. diff positive diarrhea raises the suspicion of HUS. Monitoring of renal functions and symptoms is important.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension improved after decreasing"

The patient presented with leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and diffuse C. difficile positive diarrhea. The patient's family has requested comfort measures only, and the patient has been placed on hospice care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/74 to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 77.8 kg at admission to 84.8 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1540 mL and total output of 1043 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 497 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including famotidine, metoprolol, furosemide, and morphine.

Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles in the lungs, an S3 gallop on cardiac examination, soft abdomen with no notable tenderness or bowel sounds, and cool extremities with delayed cap refill and 1+ pulses in both arms. There is also evidence of pitting edema in the right arm (3+ edema) and left arm (2+ edema), but no edema in the legs.
