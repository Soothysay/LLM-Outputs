   Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure, s/p colectomy
   24 Hour Events:
   RSBI in 190s yesterday in the evening,  therefore a decision was made
   to delay extubation until this morning.   The patient was kept
   moderately acedemic pH 7.2-7.35 to preserve respiratory drive in this
   chronically retaining patient with restrictive lung physiology.  Tmax
   of 100.0F overnight, but is afebrile this morning.  The patient
   complains of moderate pain at incision site this AM.  She continues to
   be alert and responsive, able to answer all questions and follow
   commands.

   80 y/o lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history
   of CO2 retention, R sided vocal cord paralysis, now s/p colectomy, POD
   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and kyphosis.
    Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Respiratory failure
   likely precipitated by the sedation in this chonically retaining
   patient with restrctive physiology.
   -SBT this morning.  Will attempt extubation this AM if the patient
   tolerates.  RSBI may be falsely elevated in this elderly patient with
   restrictive anatomy.  The patient appears much more alert and
   responsive this AN, making successful extubation more likely.  Will
   evaluate ABG on SBT.
   - Fentanyl 25-50 mcg bolus for pain control for now; will try to
   minimize narcotics use in this patient
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours
   .
   # S/p right Colectomy for colon CA:
   - appreciate surgery recs, NPO for now
   - Pain control as above
   - will hold ASA for now
   .
   # AS:  Mild AS on clinical exam and TTE one year ago.  The patient
   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct stable
   compared to pre-op values.  Will be careful with IVF given AS, fluid
   shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia. LR as needed.
   .
   #Anemia
 Hct slighly declined this AM to 31.4, compared to pre-op
   33.6.
   -Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for goal of Hct < 26 or signs of active
   bleeding\
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 WBC increased to 19.1 this AM from pre-op 13.0, likely
   in the setting of post-op stress.  The patient is afebrile at this
   time, so will hold off on antibiotics for now and will trend WBC
   counts.
   FEN: NPO for now/ replete lytes PRN/ IVF as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old lady who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a large mass in the right colon. She underwent an elective colectomy for colon cancer, which was performed without complications. However, postoperatively, she experienced respiratory failure due to narcotics sedation and difficulty ventilating. She was intubated and placed on SIMV mode of ventilation. On arrival at the ICU, her vital signs were stable, but she remained sedated and had poor respiratory effort. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 187, indicating a need for continued respiratory support. Her medical history includes scoliosis, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, paralyzed vocal cord, tonsillectomy, bladder suspension, left stapedectomy, left inguinal hernia repair, and three D&Cs. She also has a history of squamous cell cancers on her forehead and is currently on multiple medications including lovastatin, Evista, levothyroxine, vitamin, vitamin E, calcium, and aspirin. Allergies include penicillins, and she does not smoke or drink alcohol. Family history is notable for paternal grandmother with abdominal cancer and father with esophageal cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic CO2 retention and vocal cord dysfunction, along with postoperative sedation"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic resp failure, with hypoventilation
   likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with underlying
   restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for chronic
   respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).  Held sedatives
   overnight, much improved this AM, much more awake and interactive.
   Tolerating SBT --> will move to extubation trial.  Continue nebulizer
   prn.  Consider BiPAP as back up if fails extubation (if OK with [**Doctor First Name **]).
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.
   Will touch base re: addtional abx (has PCN allergy).  F/u final path.
   Surgicial pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
   Oncology to F/U.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 oliguria, improving with iv fluid repletion.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine, urine output closel --> may need iv fliud bolus if
   remains marginal.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia, but improving.  Would monitor i/o.  [**Month (only) 11**] benefit
   from iv fluid bous challenge.
   ANEMIA -- evidence for hemoconcentration post-op, now improving, and
   Hct back to pre-op level.  Monitor Hct.
   ELEVATED WBC
 likely stress-related, but concern for possible evolving
   infection.  No focal signs currently.  Monitor.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine, adjust dose to iv (fraction
   of home dose).
   AORTIC STENOSIS --  no treatment indicated at ths time (most recent TTE
   in [**2121**]).  Avoid afterload reduction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, right-sided vocal cord paralysis, and recently underwent a colectomy for colon cancer. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative respiratory failure.

The patient has shown improvement over the course of the day, with increased alertness and responsiveness. Her respiratory status has been monitored closely, and she has required assistance with breathing at times. She was initially intubated and received respiratory support but was extubated later in the day.

Her vital signs have been relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 87-120 bpm, blood pressure between 110/57-120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation levels ranging from 94-96%. Her temperature has been elevated, reaching up to 38 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 372 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's medical plan includes ongoing monitoring of her respiratory status, particularly given her history of restrictive lung disease and vocal cord dysfunction. She"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, vocal cord paralysis, and chronic CO2 retention. She underwent a colectomy and is now experiencing respiratory failure post-operatively. The patient was intubated due to an RSBI of 79, but extubation was attempted at 9:30 a.m. with the use of fentanyl for pain control. The patient's SpO2 levels dropped to the mid-80s while sleeping, and upper airway adventitious respiratory sounds were noted. At 9 p.m., the patient's SpO2 dropped to the mid-80s, and ABG results showed a pH of 7.26/73/74. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was started, but the patient experienced bradycardia and brief periods of apnea. The ABG values did not improve, so NIPPV was discontinued. The patient's oxygen saturation remained stable on a nasal cannula with 2 liters of oxygen.

The patient has a history of colon cancer and underwent a right colectomy. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and pain medication is being managed with fentanyl. The patient's Hct level has slightly declined to 31.4 compared to pre-operative values. Monitoring of Hct levels will continue, and transfusion will be considered for a goal Hct < 26"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.  The patient had
   transient desaturation episodes into 80s during sleep last  night.  ABG
   during the episode was 7.26/73/74 on face tent/nasal cannula.  The
   patient was started non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but was
   noted to have brief periods of apnea on NIPPV with repeat ABG
   7.27/70/139.  It was believed to be secondary to decreased respiratory
   drive due to increased oxygenation, prompting decrease of FIO2 to 30%.
   NIPPV did not seem to provide any additional benefit, pt. appeared more
   confused, ABG stable at 7.27/71/93.   NIPPV was subsequently
   discontinued. This morning, the patient is satting well on 4L NC.  She
   is A+Ox3, responds appropriately to all questions, but appears somewhat

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of restrictive lung disease, vocal cord paralysis, and recent colectomy for colon cancer. She was successfully extubated yesterday but experienced transient desaturation episodes during sleep, likely due to hypercarbia. The patient's ABG showed a pH of 7.26, with low oxygen saturation levels. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was initiated, but the patient had brief periods of apnea on NIPPV with repeat ABG results. NIPPV was subsequently discontinued.

The patient is currently stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, with a slightly somnolent appearance. Her vital signs are stable, and she denies any specific complaints. The patient has mild back pain that improves with positioning and is well-controlled with morphine.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned events. The patient's fluid balance, respiratory support, and hemodynamic monitoring are noted in the flowsheet data.

Physical examination reveals a pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress, with clear lungs and no evidence of edema or calf pain. Neurologic examination shows that the patient appears somewhat somnolent but responds appropriately to voice commands.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and slightly low platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. CXR is difficult to interpret due to kyphoscoliosis but shows no acute interval changes.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.  The patient had
   transient desaturation episodes into 80s during sleep last  night.  ABG
   during the episode was 7.26/73/74 on face tent/nasal cannula.  The
   patient was started non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but was
   noted to have brief periods of apnea on NIPPV with repeat ABG
   7.27/70/139.  It was believed to be secondary to decreased respiratory
   drive due to increased oxygenation, prompting decrease of FIO2 to 30%.
   NIPPV did not seem to provide any additional benefit, pt. appeared more
   confused, ABG stable at 7.27/71/93.   NIPPV was subsequently
   discontinued. This morning, the patient is satting well on 4L NC.  She
   is A+Ox3, responds appropriately to all questions, but appears somewhat
   more somnolent
   This morning the patient is without any specific complaints, denies
   abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  Notes mild back pain improved
   with positioning.  Pain well controlled. The patient is on Morphine
   0.5-1 mg Q4H:PRN, but has not required any doses since yesterday.  No
   flatus as of this morning.  Lopressor held this AM due to SBP in 90s.

   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Respiratory
   failure likely precipitated by the sedation in this chonically
   retaining patient with restrctive physiology.
   -SBT this morning.  Will attempt extubation this AM if the patient
   tolerates.  RSBI may be falsely elevated in this elderly patient with
   restrictive anatomy.  The patient appears much more alert and
   responsive this AN, making successful extubation more likely.  Will
   evaluate ABG on SBT.
   - Fentanyl 25-50 mcg bolus for pain control for now; will try to
   minimize narcotics use in this patient
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, vocal cord paralysis, and chronic CO2 retention. She underwent a colectomy and developed respiratory failure post-operatively. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday but experienced transient desaturation episodes during sleep last night. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was initiated but led to brief periods of apnea. The patient's ABG improved, but she appeared more confused, so NIPPV was discontinued. This morning, the patient is stable on 4 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and is alert and responsive.

The patient's pain is well-controlled with morphine, and she denies any specific complaints. However, she reports mild back pain that improves with positioning. Her allergies include penicillins, and she has a medical history of colon cancer, aortic stenosis, and anemia. She is currently on several medications including fentanyl, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
   hypoventilation likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with
   underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for
   chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).   Overall
   improved since extubation.  Continue nebulizer prn.  Consider BiPAP as
   back up if fails extubation.  Monitor ABG.
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.
   Will touch base re: addtional abx (has PCN allergy).  F/u final path.
   Surgicial pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
   Oncology to F/U.  OOB.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 oliguria, improving with iv fluid repletion.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine, urine output closel --> may need iv fliud bolus if
   remains marginal.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia improved.  Would monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- evidence for hemoconcentration post-op, now improving, and
   Hct back to pre-op level.  Monitor Hct.
   ELEVATED WBC
 likely stress-related, but concern for possible evolving
   infection.  No focal signs currently.  Monitor.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine, adjust dose to iv (fraction
   of home dose).
   AORTIC STENOSIS --  no treatment indicated at ths time (most recent TTE
   in [**2121**]).  Avoid afterload reduction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemicolectomy and kyphosis who was re-intubated in the PACU due to hypercarbia. He has underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and likely relative hypoventilation caused by narcotics/sedatives. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as indicated by elevated HCO3 at admission. Since extubation, the patient has shown overall improvement. He will continue to receive nebulizer treatment as needed and may consider BiPAP as a backup if extubation fails. ABG monitoring will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure with hypoventilation due to underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscoliosis) and chronic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABG is necessary, and BiPAP may be considered as a backup if extubation fails.

2. Colon Cancer: The patient has a history of right hemicolectomy for colon cancer. He received cipro and flagyl in the OR, and additional antibiotics may be required, considering the patient's penicillin allergy. Follow-up with oncology is recommended.

3. Surgical Pain Management: The patient requires surgical pain management, and bupivacaine local infusion via PCA pump can be used for this purpose.

4. Oliguria: The patient is experiencing oliguria, which is improving with IV fluid repletion. Close monitoring"

   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
   hypoventilation likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with
   underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for
   chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).   Overall
   improved since extubation.  Continue nebulizer prn.  Consider BiPAP as
   back up if fails extubation.  Monitor ABG.
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemicolectomy and kyphosis, who was reintubated in the PACU with hypercarbia due to underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use likely leading to relative hypoventilation. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as evidenced by elevated HCO3 at admission. Overall, the patient has improved since extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscoliosis) and chronic respiratory failure make him prone to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABG and consideration of BiPAP as a backup if extubation fails are recommended.

2. Colon Cancer: The patient has a history of colon cancer for which he underwent a right hemicolectomy. He received cipro and flagyl in the OR, and additional antibiotics should be considered given his penicillin allergy. Follow-up with final pathology is also required.

3. Surgical Pain Management: The patient requires appropriate pain management post-surgery. Bupivacaine local infusion via PCA pump can be used for this purpose.

4. Oliguria: The patient has evidence of oliguria, which is improving with IV fluid repletion. Close monitoring of BUN, creatinine, and urine output is necessary. If oliguria persists, an IV fluid bolus may be needed.

5. Anemia: The patient shows signs of hemoconcentration"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old lady with a history of restrictive lung disease, vocal cord paralysis, and recent colectomy. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure post-operatively. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. She is fully alert and oriented with normal neurological examination. The patient has decreased breath sounds at the bases and mild tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of CO2 retention and recent respiratory failure post-operatively indicates a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure. Monitoring respiratory status and avoiding opioids or using them in very low doses are important to prevent further respiratory depression.
2. Underlying Lung Disease: The patient has restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, which can contribute to respiratory compromise. Following up for underlying lung disease is crucial to optimize respiratory function.
3. S/p Right Colectomy: The patient underwent a right colectomy for colon cancer. Pain management with opioids in very low doses and adherence to surgical recommendations are essential for her recovery.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has mild aortic stenosis, which may limit her ability to tolerate high fluid intake due to potential fluid shifts post-operatively. Careful fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history
   of CO2 retention, R sided vocal cord paralysis, now s/p colectomy, POD
   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Successfully
   extubated yesterday, now satting well on NC.  Somnolence may be
   secondary to hypercarbia, however this patient is a chronic retainer
   with pCO2 close to baseline.
   - Repeat ABG to assess CO2 status.
   -Continue low dose Morphine PRN for pain control; minimize due to high
   risk of delirium.
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours
   .
   # S/p right Colectomy for colon CA:
   - Continue pain control as above
   - No antibiotics for now unless febrile or signs of infection
   - Follow surgery recs
   - will hold ASA for now
   - NPO for now
   -OOB in chair; PT consult
   .
   # AS:  Mild AS on clinical exam and TTE one year ago.  The patient
   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct continues
   to be stable, no signs of active bleed.  Will be careful with IVF given
   AS, fluid shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia.
   -LR@50 cc/hr currently; will adjust as needed to achieve above goal.
   #Anemia
 Hct stable with no signs of active bleed
   -Monitor Hct daily and transfuse for goal of Hct < 26 or signs of
   active bleeding.
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 WBC declined today to 15.2 from 19.1 yesterday.  The
   patient is afebrile at this time, so will hold off on antibiotics for
   now and will trend WBC counts.

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, vocal cord paralysis, and previous colectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure post-operatively. 

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/57 to 120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant elderly woman who is alert and responsive. She has a regular rhythm with normal rate and no signs of edema or calf pain. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 19.1 to 15.2 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin level ranging from 32.3 to 28.2%, platelet count ranging from 375 to 320 thousand cells per microliter, blood glucose level of 358 mg/dL, and sodium level of 139 mEq/L. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of the patient's respiratory status with repeat ABG to assess CO2 status. Pain control will be continued with low-dose morphine PRN, and bupivacaine via abdominal catheter for 72 hours. 

The patient will be kept NPO for now, with plans for OOB in a chair and"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
   hypoventilation likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with
   underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for
   chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).   Overall
   improved since extubation.  Continue nebulizer prn.  Consider BiPAP as
   back up if fails extubation.  Monitor ABG.
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.
   Will touch base re: addtional abx (has PCN allergy).  F/u final path.
   Surgicial pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
   Oncology to F/U.  OOB.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- cautious use of narcotics & pain meds (low dose).
   RENAL FUNCTION
 oliguria, improving with iv fluid repletion.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine, urine output closel --> may need iv fliud bolus if
   remains marginal.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia improved.  Would monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- evidence for hemoconcentration post-op, now improving, and
   Hct back to pre-op level.  Monitor Hct.
   ELEVATED WBC
 likely stress-related, but concern for possible evolving
   infection.  No focal signs currently.  Monitor.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine, adjust dose to iv (fraction
   of home dose).
   AORTIC STENOSIS --  no treatment indicated at ths time (most recent TTE
   in [**2121**]).  Avoid afterload reduction.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemicolectomy and kyphosis who was reintubated in the PACU due to hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use likely leading to relative hypoventilation. The patient has respiratory failure with hypoventilation attributed to the use of narcotics/sedatives and underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscoliosis), as well as evidence of chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission). Overall, the patient has improved since extubation and is currently tolerating sips of clear liquids. The patient remains hoarse (chronic vocal cord paralysis) but almost back to baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to hypoventilation, underlying restrictive lung disease (kyphoscoliosis), and chronic respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which could be due to stress or an evolving infection. Close monitoring is necessary to rule out any infection.
3. Renal Function: The patient has oliguria but is improving with IV fluid repletion. Close monitoring of BUN, creatinine, and urine output is needed to ensure adequate renal function.
4. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has low phosphate levels, which need to be repleted.
5. Anemia: The patient has evidence of hemoconcentration post-op"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
   hypoventilation likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with
   underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for
   chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).   Overall
   improved since extubation.  Continue nebulizer prn.  Consider BiPAP as
   back up if fails extubation.  Monitor ABG.
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.
   Will touch base re: addtional abx (has PCN allergy).  F/u final path.
   Surgicial pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
   Oncology to F/U.  OOB.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- cautious use of narcotics & pain meds (low dose).
   RENAL FUNCTION
 oliguria, improving with iv fluid repletion.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine, urine output closel --> may need iv fliud bolus if
   remains marginal.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia improved.  Would monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- evidence for hemoconcentration post-op, now improving, and
   Hct back to pre-op level.  Monitor Hct.
   ELEVATED WBC
 likely stress-related, but concern for possible evolving
   infection.  No focal signs currently.  Monitor.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine, adjust dose to iv (fraction
   of home dose).
   AORTIC STENOSIS --  no treatment indicated at ths time (most recent TTE
   in [**2121**]).  Avoid afterload reduction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old individual with a history of right open hemicolectomy and kyphosis. The patient was re-intubated in the PACU due to hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use likely leading to relative hypoventilation. The patient has been extubated and is showing overall improvement.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of restrictive ventilatory deficit and hypoventilation, which puts them at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABG (arterial blood gas) is recommended.

2. Colon Cancer: The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy for colon cancer and received antibiotics (cipro and flagyl) in the operating room. Further follow-up is needed regarding additional antibiotics due to the patient's penicillin allergy and final pathology report.

3. Pain Management: The patient requires cautious use of narcotics and pain medications. Low-dose morphine is being used for pain management.

4. Renal Function: The patient had oliguria, which is improving with IV fluid repletion. Close monitoring of BUN, creatinine, and urine output is necessary. The patient may need an IV fluid bolus if renal function remains marginal.

5. Hypophosphatemia: The patient requires repletion for hypophosphatemia.

6. Fluids: The patient had hypovolemia,"
