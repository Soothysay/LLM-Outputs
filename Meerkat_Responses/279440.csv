","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile infection, admitted with fever and hypotension, likely septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and chronic C. difficile infection. He developed a rash after receiving antibiotics, which improved with budesonide and hydroxyzine. The patient's acute renal failure has improved, likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis. The patient has a mild dementia and a heart murmur, with no prior transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) in our system. There is a suspicion of an aortic stenosis murmur, and a TTE is planned to evaluate for valvular disease and rule out vegetations.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening lung function, respiratory failure, and sepsis if not treated appropriately.
2. Recurrence of C. difficile infection: Despite treatment, the patient has a history of refractory C. difficile infection, and there is a concern for recurrence. This can result in severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of other infections.
3. Hypotension and shock: The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, which resolved but could recur if the underlying cause is not addressed. This can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
 RASH
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with history of refractory C.diff recently off PO vancomycin; admit
   with fever and hypotension, likely septic shock.
   .
   # Hypotension.  With fever, leukocytosis; most likely represents septic
   shock, as has been refractory to adequate fluid resuscitation (5L).
   Possible infectious sources include pneumonia (infiltrate on CXR),
   C.diff (given strong history though benign current exam),
   bacteremia/endocarditis (no known risk factors), urosepsis (though UA
   benign).  Other possible causes or contributors to hypotension include
   cardiogenic (ACS or CHF), PE, though less likely in setting of other
   findings.
   - CVL in place; goal CVP 8-12, bolus prn.
   - If continues to be hypotensive despite adequate CVP, will start
   norepinephrine, goal MAP > 60-65.  A line placement if persistently
   hypotensive.
   - Send central venous sat off line.
   - Broad spectrum abx for coverage of CAP, gram positives, gram
   negatives, C.diff - vanco/cefepime/PO vanc/levoflox.  Does not clearly
   have pseudomonal risk factors; consider change from cefepime to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Send cardiac enzymes, though if positive likely reflects demand
   picture.
   - Consider sending cortisol/stim (mainly prognostic value).
   - Consider APC if meets APACHE criteria.
   .
   # Pneumonia - CAP vs. HCAP.  Also consider aspiration.
   - Abx as above.
   - Management of sepsis as above.
   - Check legionella.  Sputum culture.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Likely infectious as above.  WBCs concerning for
   recurrence of C.diff as well.
   - f/u urine and blood cultures.
   - send c.diff; if positive or develops abdominal symptoms consider
   further abdominal imaging.
   - management of sepsis as above; broad coverage abx.
   - C.diff coverage with vanco while on broad spectrums.
   .
   # ARF.  Mild renal impairment - volume depletion/hypotension most
   likely.  At this point prerenal vs. ATN.
   - Foley to gravity, monitor I/O.
   - s/p 5 L hydration as above.
   - Avoid hypotension and nephrotoxins.
   .
   # Hypoxia.  With concern for pneumonia as above.  Also s/p 5 L IVFs,
   though no cardiac history.
   - Treatment of pneumonia.
   - Wean O2 if tolerated.
   - Consider Aline placement.
   .
   # Dementia.  Mild.
   -          Family desires continuation of remeron and donepezil; okay
   for now.
   # Heart murmur.  No prior TTEs in our system. ?AS murmur.
   - will check TTE, eval for valvular disease, rule out vegetations.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of refractory Clostridium difficile (C.diff) infection recently off PO vancomycin. The patient was admitted with fever and hypotension, likely septic shock. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate between 83-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/45 mmHg to 165/84 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24,400 cells/mm³, elevated blood glucose level of 111 mg/dL, and slightly elevated lactate acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values are mostly within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and septic shock. The possible infectious sources include pneumonia, C.diff, bacteremia/endocarditis, and urosepsis. 

The plan of care includes fluid resuscitation, central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics for coverage of CAP, gram positives, gram negatives, and C.diff, and consideration for additional interventions"
