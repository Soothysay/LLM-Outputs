","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old nursing home resident admitted for a right femoral fracture repair. They have been experiencing intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with periods of atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's blood pressure is marginal and they are currently being titrated up on metoprolol. They may require amiodarone or digoxin as well. The patient's troponin levels were elevated but have trended down. They have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and they refuse Coumadin. The patient's psychosis etiology is unclear. They have a sacral decubitus ulcer and require wound care. The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). They are also replete with electrolytes as needed and have a bowel regimen. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and their disposition is deferred. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's intermittent SVT and history of elevated troponin levels indicate potential cardiac complications. Further evaluation and management of their heart condition is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of DVT and PE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old nursing home resident with a history of psychosis and cognitive decline. She was admitted for a right femoral fracture repair but is now experiencing intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with rates up to 170 beats per minute. The patient's blood pressure is marginal and being titrated with IV metoprolol. Digoxin loading has been initiated. The patient is being followed by cardiology and is on telemetry monitoring. She has elevated troponin levels, which have trended down, and no history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Nuclear stress testing is planned when the patient is clinically more stable. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been discovered as potential causes for the SVT, but the patient refuses Coumadin. Orthopedic follow-up is scheduled for the femoral fracture, and Lovenox will be used for both the fracture and PE. Psychiatry is following up on the patient's unclear etiology of psychosis, advising avoidance of benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and opiates. Low-dose risperidone may be used if necessary. Wound care is being provided for a sacral decubitus, and GERD is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's electrolytes are repleted as needed, and she has a sacral decubitus"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old nursing home resident with a history of psychosis and cognitive decline. She was admitted for a right femoral fracture that required surgical repair. The patient has been transferred to the ICU multiple times for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Her current medications include IV metoprolol, digoxin, and others as per the cardiology plan.

The patient's recent events include remaining psychotic and non-conversant but appropriate at times. She refuses oral medications but will take them if ground and mixed into applesauce. Her temperature trended down in the 70s-90s range. The digoxin level is within range as per the cardiology plan.

Vital signs show a temperature of 100.6 (rectally), heart rate of 92 (75-109), blood pressure of 107/47 (120s-90s/50s-30s), respiratory rate of 20 (13-35), and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance are stable.

The patient has a history of acute pulmonary embolism in the posterior basal right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries, along with a new small right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. There are also unchanged biapical scarring, mild cylindrical bronchiectasis at the left apex, unchanged coronary artery calcifications, and unknown hemodynamic significance of a"

","The patient is a 77-year-old nursing home resident with a history of psychosis and cognitive decline. They were admitted for a right femoral fracture repair but developed intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) up to 170's. The patient's vital signs are stable, but blood pressure is marginal. They are currently being titrated up on metoprolol and are receiving digoxin loading as per cardiology recommendations.

The patient has elevated troponin levels, which have trended down. There is no history of coronary artery disease. The patient refuses Coumadin for pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but is on Lovenox.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable after a drop during the hip fracture early in the hospital course.

Psychiatry is following up on the patient's psychosis, advising against the use of benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and opiates. Low-dose risperidone may be used if necessary.
