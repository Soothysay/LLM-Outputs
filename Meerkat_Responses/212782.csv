   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M with PMH of systolic CHF, known pleural effusions, admitted
   with worsening shortness of breath and LE swelling x 1 month.
   .
   #  DYSPNEA: Primary complaint on admission.  Likely related to
   recurrent pleural effusion, bradycardia, hypoalbuminemia [**12-30**] poor
   nutrition and some element of medication noncompliance which may be
   worsening his COPD control.  No e/o of decompensated heart failure on
   exam or CXR, BNP lower than prior baseline.  Could consider ACS but no
   chest pressure. Bradycardia resolved ON w/ HR 70-80s
   - Continue Albuterol, Tiotroprium and Salmeterol-Fluticasone; start
   scheduled Albuterol
   - Supplemental oxygen
   - Consider thoracentesis for symptomatic benefit today
   .
   #  Systolic CHF: Unclear etiology, though likely some component of
   alcohol cardiomyopathy and possibly some tachy-myopathy.  No h/o
   ischemia. EF 35%. BNP > 15,000 but lower than prior admission.  JVP not
   elavated and no e/o CXR.  Pulmonary exam with diminished sounds at
   bases [**12-30**] effusions, which may be due to CHF.  LE edema likely
   multifactorial and not [**Last Name (un) 6759**] attributable to CHF
   - Held BP medications given normotensive (Hydralazine / Imdur) o/n
   can restart this AM
   - Hold Diltiazem / Metoprolol given bradycardia yesterday. But will
   reconsider restarting beta blocker (low dose) if HR continues to be
   stable.
   - Hold Lasix given mild hypovolemia
   - Daily ASA
   .
   #  CORONARIES: No prior cardiac catheterization.  No prior ischemic
   events. No plan to cath at this time.
   - ASA daily
   .
   #  PUMP: History of Systolic CHF; Ef = 30%.  NO e/o volume overload at
   this time.
   .
   #  RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation with decreased ventricular response.
   - Hold rate controlling agents given bradycardia
   .
   #  ARF: Unclear etiology.  Worsened from prior baseline.  Appears
   intravascularly dry on exam. CXR without volume overload.  Denies any
   dsyuria.
   - FeNa 1%
   - IVF o/n and Cr trend improved slightly.
   - Will continue to trend Cr
   .
   #  Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With elevated lactate, low
   bicarbonate. On prior admission, resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   Some component of dehydration.  Lactate may be related to poor liver
   function.
   - Responded well to fluid resuscitate. Will trial PO today.
   - Trend lactate
   - Monitor labs
   .
   #  Alcohol Abuse: Reported h/o DTs with seizures.  Patient states
   seizures are unrelated and he gets them when he's 'hot and cold.
   description suggestive of rigors vs. seizures.  SW consult ordered
   today
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
 f/u labs
   - CIWA with Valium
   - Seizure / aspiration precautions
   .
   #  Anemia: Normocytic and similar to prior levels.  No e/o acute blood
   loss, patient refused rectal exam in ED.
   - Trend, if worsens will T&C
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Rate well-controlled on diltiazem and
   metoprolol. Continued aspirin. Coumadin therapy deferred due to
   patient preference and concerns regarding  medication and
   monitoring noncompliance.
   - Rate &0s, well controlled this morning
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus type II - On Metformin in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be contributing
   to Lactic acidosis.
   - ISS with FS QACHS
   - Hold Metformin
   .
   # Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Complaining of dyspnea as
   above, likely multifactorial.
   - Continue Advair, Spiriva, and Albuterol prn.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia / Hypochloremia: Suspect [**12-30**] hypovolemia and
   malnutrition from chronic alcoholism.  Calculated sodium deficit
   recommends 160cc/hr of NS x 16 hours to reach 130; will give more
   slowly given CHF
   - Continue IV NS (~75cc/hr) to replete sodium
   - Continue to monitor labs; recheck lytes
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Patient stated pain is diffuse and chronic but
   resolved o/n.  Also with some nausea prior to admission w/ some
   sputum/clear fluid emesis this AM.
   - Zofran PRN nausea
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia: New thrombocytopenia.  [**Month (only) 60**] represent overall poor
   hepatic function.
   - Trend, avoid medications that worsen
   .
   #  Elevated INR: Concerning for worsened hepatic function; also with
   likely some element of malnutrition.
   - Trend coagulopathy
   .
   # Recurrent left pleural effusion -  Previously evaluated for this.  On
   last admission, underwent left-sided diagnostic and therapeutic
   thoracentesis on [**2200-4-14**] with removal of 2.3L transudative fluid.
   Cytology negative for malignant cells. Attributed to chronic systolic
   CHF and medication noncompliance. Added hydralazine and isosorbide for
   better afterload reduction. Adequate room air ambulatory oxygen
   saturation prior to discharge.  Now readmitted with worsened effusion,
   dyspnea and new O2 requirement.
   - Consider thoracentesis today
   .
   # Mediastinal lymphadenopathy/pulmonary nodules -  Noted on prior
   admission, recommended follow-up CT in 3 months.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), known pleural effusions, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity (LE) swelling for one month.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/73 mmHg to 103/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a decreased ventricular response.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished but mildly agitated, with occasional non-productive cough and difficulty breathing. The patient is oriented to time, place, and person. There are no signs of pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. Sclera is anicteric, pupils are equal and reactive, and conjunctiva are pink. The neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm. Cardiac examination reveals a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds. No murmurs, gallops, or lifts are appreciated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), known pleural effusions, and admitted with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling for one month.

The patient's chief complaint upon admission was dyspnea, which is likely related to recurrent pleural effusion, bradycardia, and some element of medication noncompliance that may be worsening his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) control. There are no signs of decompensated heart failure on the exam or chest X-ray, and the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is lower than the prior baseline.

The patient's systolic CHF etiology is unclear, although it is likely a combination of alcohol cardiomyopathy and possibly tachycardia-induced myocardopathy. There is no history of ischemia, and the BNP level is significantly reduced from the prior admission. The patient has diminished breath sounds at the bases, which may be due to CHF. The lower extremity edema is likely multifactorial and not solely attributable to CHF.

The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a decreased ventricular response. Rate-controlling agents should be held due to bradycardia. Other assessments and plans include:

- Coronaries: No prior cardiac catheterization. No prior ischemic events.
- Pump: History of syst"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), known pleural effusions, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presents with worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and mild agitation. The patient has received Valium for hallucinations and agitation. He also requested an albuterol inhaler.

Vital signs show a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/73 mmHg to 103/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a decreased ventricular response.

Physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities or signs of distress. The patient has mild expiratory wheezes, decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases, and 2+ edema in the lower extremities. There are no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate, and liver enzymes (AST, ALT). The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, low bicarbonate, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC). The platelet count is also decreased.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient's current condition includes dyspnea, hypoxia, and recurrent left pleural effusion. He also has anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hyponatremia/hypochloremia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and decreased oxygen saturation may progress to ARDS if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's history of CHF and recurrent pleural effusion increases the risk of cardiac tamponade.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated INR and history of alcohol abuse raise concerns for hepatic dysfunction and potential development of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Seizures: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and DTs with seizures indicates a risk for recurrent seizures.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and history of alcohol abuse increase the risk of developing DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient has also been experiencing dyspnea, hypoxia, and a recurrent left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic CHF: The patient's condition is worsening due to fluid overload, leading to pulmonary congestion and decreased oxygenation.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicates inadequate oxygenation, which may be caused by the acute on chronic CHF and COPD.
3. Recurrent left pleural effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent pleural effusions, which can be attributed to chronic systolic CHF and medication noncompliance. The effusion is worsening, causing dyspnea and new O2 requirement.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new-onset thrombocytopenia, which could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute on chronic CHF or liver disease.
5. Hyponatremia/hypochloremia: The patient's hyponatremia and hypochloremia could be"

He presented to the CCU with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF, initially managed with fluid resuscitation but resulted in worsening heart failure. The patient also has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion, previously evaluated for this condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic CHF, and his current symptoms suggest acute exacerbation. Proper management with diuretics and afterload reduction medications is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and worsening respiratory status may require intubation and mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic heart failure, which worsened despite fluid resuscitation. He required mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic heart failure: The patient's heart failure appears to have worsened during admission, leading to increased dyspnea, hypoxia, and fluid overload.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing COPD may have contributed to his respiratory distress and required additional management.
3. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a reported history of alcohol abuse and delirium tremens (DTs) with seizures. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms should be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Recurrent left pleural effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion, which could be related to his chronic systolic heart failure and medication noncompliance.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new-onset thrombocytopenia, which could be related to poor hepatic function or other underlying causes.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR suggests worsened hepatic function or malnutrition.

   59 yo M with PMH of systolic CHF, hx of transudative pleural effusions,
   admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF initially managed
   with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure transferred to MICU for
   hypoxia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / Hypoxia
 likely CHF exacerbation and CAP
   - will continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - pt was intubated yesterday secondary to worsening respiratory status
   (now on CMV with PEEP of 10 and FiO2 50%)
 will attempt to wean down
   to a PEEP of 5 and a FiO2 of 40%
   - UOP was low earlier in the day yesterday; picked up when he was given
   a bolus of fluid for hypotension
   - for his CAP, the patient is on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vanco
   (given hx of MRSA)
 will stop azithromycin and vancomyin and just keep
   ceftriaxone until sensitivites are back
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - unclear etiology (per cards, possibly some component of alcohol
   cardiomyopathy and possibly some tachy-myopathy)
   - continue metoprolol; possibly start him on an ACEi
 hold hydralazine
   for now given patient
s hypertension
   - pt
s [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9533**] was held
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse

 will hold off on restarting
   diltiazem at this point
   - pt not on coumadin per personal preference
   .
   # ARF:
   - UOP very decreased earlier yesterday; actually seemed to pick up
   after a fluid bolus
   - continue to monitor UOP, BUN, and Cr
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct dropped some yesterday and patient was given a unit of [**Date Range **]
   - will obtain another Hct this pm and then q12hrs
 transfuse if Hct
   drops below 21

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), alcohol abuse, and transudative pleural effusions. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF initially managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. He is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and dyspnea/hypoxia likely due to CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and hypoxia could lead to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for over 48 hours increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in people receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ongoing hypoxia may increase the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output (UOP) and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AK"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and alcohol abuse. Upon admission, the patient required invasive ventilation, and various lines were placed including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. The patient also underwent cultures, specifically sputum and urine cultures. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.5 degrees Celsius. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's requirement for invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be administered.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at increased risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be initiated to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recurrent transudative pleural effusions, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient's respiratory status worsened, leading to hypoxia, and he was intubated yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's condition suggests acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and hypoxia.
2. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient is being treated for CAP with antibiotics (ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin). This infection could potentially worsen his respiratory status and overall condition.
3. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may contribute to malnutrition, thiamine deficiency, and increased risk of seizures and aspiration.
4. Recurrent pleural effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent transudative pleural effusions, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), transudative pleural effusions, admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF. The patient was initially managed with fluids but resulted in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. He has a central line placed in the left internal jugular vein, a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and Foley catheter. He is receiving antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin) and medications for systolic CHF (hydralazine and metoprolol).

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse with reported delirium tremens and seizures. Ethanol was found on admission, and the patient is receiving multivitamins, thiamine, and folate. Social work recommendations are pending, and seizure/aspiration precautions are in place.

The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion, which was tapped in April or May and found to be transudative in nature. Diuretics are being continued.

The patient initially had atrial fibrillation with decreased ventricular response but now has a heart rate in the 80-90 range. Metoprolol"

   a bolus of fluid for hypotension
   - for his CAP, the patient is on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vanco
   (given hx of MRSA)
 will stop azithromycin and vancomyin and just keep
   ceftriaxone until sensitivites are back

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF, managed with fluids but resulting in worsening heart failure. He was intubated due to worsening respiratory status and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, haloperidol, metoprolol, albuterol, ipratropium, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and weaning off mechanical ventilation will be necessary.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of systolic CHF and AF. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart block, or worsening heart failure may occur. Monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is essential, and medications like metoprolol will be continued.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with CAP. There is a risk of progression or development of other infections, especially due to his immunocompromised state. Continued monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, initially managed with fluids but resulted in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute-on-chronic CHF, anemia, pneumonia, community-acquired (CAP), and other cardiomyopathy. He has also had recurrent left pleural effusion, alcohol abuse, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for respiratory support.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count indicates potential bleeding risks and needs monitoring.
4. Elevated INR: The increased INR suggests impaired liver function and an increased risk of bleeding.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's elevated INR and anemia may indicate malnutrition, which can complicate recovery.
6. Alcohol withdrawal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, which resulted in worsening respiratory status. The patient was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia. He has since developed respiratory failure, anemia, pneumonia, and cardiac complications related to his pre-existing conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and the need for intubation indicate a high risk for developing ARDS.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Sepsis: The presence of pneumonia and the use of antibiotics suggest a risk of developing sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF, AF, and alcohol abuse puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
5. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and the presence of thrombocytopenia increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary emb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and type II diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient then developed hypoxia and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic CHF, anemia, pneumonia (community-acquired), and possible components of alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachycardia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. He is receiving antibiotics for his pneumonia and diuretics for CHF. The patient also has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion, for which he had a chest tube placement. He is being monitored for atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, hypochloremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy/pulmonary nodules.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic transudative pleural effusions, and admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF. The patient was initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AFib.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: likely CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

2. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a pleural effusion that was tapped in the past. It is important to monitor for changes in chest X-ray (CXR).

   59 yo M with PMH of systolic CHF, hx of transudative pleural effusions,
   admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF initially managed
   with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure transferred to MICU for
   hypoxia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / Hypoxia
 likely CHF exacerbation and CAP
   - on fentanyl gtt at 75 and versed gtt at 3
   - will continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - pt was intubated secondary to worsening respiratory status (now on
   CMV with PEEP of 5 and FiO2 40
   - for his CAP, the patient is on ceftriaxone
 will continue
   ceftriaxone now and obtain another sputum culture
   .
   # Systolic CHF
   - unclear etiology (per cards, possibly some component of alcohol
   cardiomyopathy and possibly some tachy-myopathy)
   - will continue metoprolol and will continue to hold hydralazine, as
   patient is normotensive
   - will also give pt a 40 mg IV Lasix bolus and then start pt on Lasix
   gtt
 goal diuresis is around 1 to 1.5L today
   - pt
s long-acting nitrate was held
   - pt can possibly be started on an ACEi in the long term
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse
 Reported h/o DTs with seizures.
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate
   - follow-up B12
   - Stopped CIWA because pt was snowed on benzodiazepines initially when
   he was in the ICU
   - F/u social work recs
 SW says that they will see the patient when he
   is able to communicate
   # Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion
 was tapped in [**4-5**]
   - continue to monitor for changes in CXR
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   - HR still elevated
   - will increase metoprolol to 50 mg TID
   - will hold off on restarting diltiazem at this point
   - pt not on coumadin per personal preference
   .
   # ARF
   - current creatinine 1.4
 seems to be trending down
   - continue to monitor UOP, BUN, and Cr

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. He was then transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is stable. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C, heart rate (HR) 107 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 148/89 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100%.

The patient has been diuresing well and at goal, with a total output of 2,030 mL in the past 24 hours. His laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.0, hematocrit (Hct) of 26.2%, platelet count of 121,000/mm3, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 76 mg/dL. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+) level of 4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic heart failure, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia due to likely CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of transudative pleural effusions and is currently experiencing a large left pleural effusion. Continuous monitoring for changes in chest X-ray and consideration of a repeat CT scan without contrast due to prior CT showing trapped lung are recommended.

2. Systolic CHF: The patient's systolic CHF is of unclear etiology, possibly involving alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachy-myopathy. Management includes continuing metoprolol, holding hydralazine as the patient is normotensive, discontinuing Lasix gtt and providing boluses as needed, and considering an ACE inhibitor in the long term.

3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has reported a history of delirium tremens with seizures and appears to be over this window. Continued MVI, thiamine, and folate supplementation, as well as follow-up B12 levels and social work recommendations, are necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, and an increased dose of metoprolol is recommended to control the heart rate. Holding off on restarting diltiazem and considering anticoagulation therapy with coumadin should be discussed with the patient.

5. Acute Respiratory Failure (not ARDS): The patient is currently ventilated well on assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 550 mL and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Weaning to pressure support ventilation (PSV) is planned. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations will continue for COPD management. Ceftriaxone will be continued for CAP, and another sputum culture will be obtained.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is currently 23.8%. Transfusion is indicated if Hct drops below 21. Guaiac stool testing should be done to assess for gastrointestinal bleeding.

7. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient is currently on insulin secretagogues (ISS).

8. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Continued management with albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations is recommended.

9. Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Hyponatremia has resolved, and continued monitoring to see if it corrects with diuresis is advised. Lytes should be checked regularly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. The patient has a positive fluid balance. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin-T, elevated lactate level, and elevated levels of several enzymes. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, due to underlying cardiac dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic medications.
6. Stress ulcer due to increased gastric acid production caused by critical illness and corticosteroid use.
7. Barotrauma or bronchopleural fistula from high-pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type II diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic heart failure, managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure, and then transferred to the MICU for hypoxia. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, anemia, pneumonia (bacterial community-acquired), recurrent left pleural effusion, systolic congestive heart failure, alcohol abuse, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, COPD, hyponatremia/hypochloremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy/pulmonary nodules. The patient is currently sedated but following commands, with chest crackles, soft abdomen, and large left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. He is on multiple medications and treatments for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it is mentioned as ""not ARDS.""
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and possible alcohol-related cardiomyopathy."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, initially managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

24-hour events:
- The patient's PCP visited, and he became tachycardic with some apnea. He was returned to the Acute Care (AC) setting.
- The patient is diuresing well and at goal.
- Metoprolol was increased.
- Lasix infusion was increased.
- The patient is on 2 mg/hour of Versed, 50 mcg/hour of fentanyl, and 4 mg/hour of Lasix.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies.

Infusions:
- Furosemide (Lasix) - 4 mg/hour
- Midazolam (Versed) - 2 mg/hour
- Fentanyl (Concentrate) - 50 mcg/hour

Other ICU medications:
- Metoprolol - increased on [**2200-6-6**] 04:30 PM
- Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) - started on [**2200-6-6**] 08:48 PM

 likely CHF exacerbation and CAP
   - oxygenating and ventilating well on AC 550 x 18, PEEP 5, 40% FIO2
   - diuresing well and at goal
   - will attempt to wean to PS this AM
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - for his CAP, continue ceftriaxone (end day [**2200-6-9**]) and obtain
   another sputum culture
   - Plan to extubate Monday
   # Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion
 was tapped in [**4-5**]
   - continue to monitor for changes in CXR
   - will check CT without contrast due to prior CT showing trapped lung
   - Talk to IP/Thoracics on Monday re: Trapped lung (decortication vs.
   pleuridesis)
   # Systolic CHF
   - unclear etiology (per cards, possibly some component of alcohol
   cardiomyopathy and possibly some tachy-myopathy)
   - will continue metoprolol and will continue to hold hydralazine, as
   patient is normotensive
   - will d/c lasix gtt and provide boluses as needed
   - pt can possibly be started on an ACEi in the long term
   # Alcohol Abuse
 Reported h/o DTs with seizures, appears he is over
   this window
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate
   - follow-up B12
   - F/u social work recs
 SW says that they will see the patient when he
   is able to communicate
    # Atrial Fibrillation
   - HR still elevated
   - will increase metoprolol to 150 mg TID; per PCP this has been a
   problem in the past as well and he has required upto 300 mg
   - will hold off on restarting diltiazem at this point
   - pt not on coumadin per personal preference
   # ARF
   - current creatinine 1.0
 trending down
   - continue to monitor UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Anemia
   - pt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and other comorbidities. The patient was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation, managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure, and subsequently transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's chief complaints include dyspnea and hypoxia, likely due to CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for CAP. The plan is to wean the patient off the ventilator on Monday.

The patient also has recurrent left pleural effusion, which was tapped previously. A CT scan without contrast will be obtained due to prior CT showing trapped lung. The decision regarding decortication or pleurodesis will be discussed with interventional pulmonology on Monday.

The patient has systolic CHF of unclear etiology, possibly involving alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachy-myopathy. The management plan includes continuing metoprolol, holding hydralazine, discontinuing lasix gtt, and providing boluses as needed. The patient may be started on an ACE inhibitor in the long term.

The patient reported a history of alcohol abuse with delirium tremens and seizures. The management plan includes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and type II diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, initially managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia.

24-hour events include stopping lasix gtt, CT chest without contrast to evaluate trapped lung and persistent loculated effusion, and tachycardia to 140s overnight, for which he was given 10 mg IV lopressor with moderate response.

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl (concentrate) infusions. He has been prescribed metoprolol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ceftriaxone, and other medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 114 bpm (81-132 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 119/71 mmHg (88/53-155/107 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute (10-22 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and central"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), alcohol abuse, and possible cardiomyopathy.
- He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.
- The patient is currently being treated for respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic CHF and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
- He has recurrent left pleural effusion and requires further evaluation and management.
- The patient's systolic CHF etiology is unclear but may involve alcohol-related cardiomyopathy and tachycardia.
- Alcohol abuse is reported, with a history of delirium tremens and seizures. The patient appears to be over this episode.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with an elevated heart rate, and his blood pressure is being monitored.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) is present, with a current creatinine level of 1.0, which is trending down.
- The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit of 25.1, and will be transfused if the hemoglobin drops"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and other medical conditions. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation, managed with fluids initially but resulted in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and is now on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion and is being monitored for changes in chest X-ray. A CT scan without contrast is also planned due to prior CT showing trapped lung. The patient may require further intervention such as decortication or pleuridesis.
2. Systolic CHF: The patient's systolic CHF etiology is unclear, possibly including alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachy-myopathy. Treatment includes continuing metoprolol, holding hydralazine, providing lasix boluses as needed, and considering an ACE inhibitor in the long term.
3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse with previous episodes of delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Treatment includes multivitamins, thiamine, folate, and follow-up B12 levels. Social work recommendations are pending when"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxia and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent pleural effusions, which may require further intervention such as tapping or surgical procedures like decortication or pleurodesis.
2. Systolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient's heart failure symptoms are worsening, indicating an exacerbation of his systolic CHF. This can lead to further fluid overload, respiratory distress, and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If his condition does not improve, he may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
4. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can progress to severe pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and recent withdrawal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and other comorbidities. The patient was admitted with bradycardia and acute exacerbation of CHF, initially managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing a CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He is oxygenating and ventilating well on assisted mechanical ventilation (AC 550 x 18, PEEP 5, 40% FIO2) and continues to diurese well, with a negative fluid balance of ~2L yesterday. The plan is to attempt weaning to pressure support (PS) this morning and extubate the patient.

2. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a left pleural effusion that was tapped in the past. It is important to monitor for changes in chest X-ray and consider a CT scan without contrast due to a prior CT showing trapped lung. There is an ongoing discussion regarding the need for surgical intervention, such as decortication or pleurodesis, which is awaiting reply from the interventional pulmonology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and alcohol abuse. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving sedation, diuresis with Lasix, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/73 mmHg to 160/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count. The patient has several medical problems including constipation, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, anemia, pneumonia, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a history of alcohol abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to PE.
3. Sepsis: With elevated white blood cell count and signs of infection, the patient is at risk for sepsis, especially considering the presence of pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, CHF, and cardiomyopathy, increasing the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or myocardial infarction.
5. Renal dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by medications and fluid balance issues.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: Prolonged ICU stay and limited oral intake can lead to malnutrition and associated complications.
7. Pressure injuries: Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure injuries.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and alcohol abuse history puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and implement appropriate measures to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Comments:
   Communication: with Patient Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: MICU
","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure, then transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on assisted control ventilation (AC) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 40%. It is planned to attempt extubation again today.

2. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a pleural effusion that was tapped on [**4-5**]. It is important to continue monitoring for changes in chest X-ray (CXR) and consider a computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast due to prior CT showing trapped lung. A discussion regarding decortication versus pleuridesis is pending.

3. Systolic CHF: The etiology of the patient's systolic CHF is unclear, possibly involving alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Metoprolol will be continued,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and other comorbidities. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF initially managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: likely CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He is oxygenating and ventilating well on assisted ventilation, and diuresis is continuing. The plan is to attempt extubation again today.

2. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a pleural effusion that was tapped on [**4-5**]. Monitoring for changes in chest X-ray (CXR) and considering a CT scan without contrast due to prior CT showing trapped lung is planned. Consultation with interventional pulmonology/thoracics regarding decortication versus pleurodesis is pending.

3. Systolic CHF: The etiology of systolic CHF is unclear, possibly related to alcohol cardiomyopathy and/or tachycardia. Metoprolol is being continued, and hydralazine is held as the patient is normotensive. Diuresis will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxia and worsening heart failure. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled blood pressure and oxygenation on mechanical ventilation. He continues to diurese well and has had a negative fluid balance of 3.5 liters in the past day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusions, which require ongoing monitoring for changes in chest X-ray. A computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast may be necessary due to prior CT showing trapped lung. Consultation with thoracic surgery for potential decortication or pleurectomy is being considered but may be canceled due to the patient's social situation.

2. Systolic CHF: The patient has systolic CHF with an unclear etiology, possibly including alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Management includes continuing metoprolol, holding hydralazine, and continuing diuresis with the goal of maximum tolerated dose. Long-term consideration for starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) may be appropriate.

3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and reported episodes of delirium tremens (DTs) with seizures. Ongoing management includes continued multivitamins, thiamine, and folate supplementation. Follow-up on vitamin B12 levels and referral to social work for further evaluation and recommendations are necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled with metoprolol at a dose of 125 mg three times daily. Previous history of requiring higher doses of metoprolol for rate control is noted. Holding off on restarting diltiazem at this point is advised due to the patient's preference against anticoagulation therapy.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's current creatinine level is trending down at 0.9. Close monitoring of urine output (UOP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is essential to assess renal function.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is currently 24.9, indicating anemia. Transfusion criteria include a hematocrit below 21. Additionally, guaiac stools and peripheral smear examination should be conducted to evaluate for any bleeding or underlying causes of anemia.

7. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient is being managed with insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS).

8. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Continued use of albuterol and ip"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol abuse, and possible alcohol-related cardiomyopathy. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. He initially received fluid management but developed worsening heart failure and hypoxia, leading to transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure, pneumonia (community-acquired), recurrent left pleural effusion, and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). Other issues include alcohol abuse, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, COPD, hyponatremia/hypochloremia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated INR.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on lasix gtt at 15mg/hr with the goal of maximum diuresis. He is also receiving other medications such as aspirin, chlorhexidine gluconate, docusate sodium, folic acid, furosemide, heparin, insulin, ipratropium bromide, lansoprazole, lactulose, magnesium sulfate, metoprolol tartrate, multivitamins, propofol, senna,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and other comorbidities. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF, initially managed with fluids resulting in worsening heart failure. The patient has been in the ICU for hypoxia and is currently extubated. He continues to diurese well and will attempt to be extubated again today. The patient's pleural effusion was tapped previously, and he will continue to be monitored for any changes in chest X-ray and diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a previous pleural effusion that was tapped, and there is a concern for its recurrence. Monitoring for changes in the chest X-ray and continuing diuresis as much as tolerated is important.

2. Systolic CHF: The patient has systolic CHF with an unclear etiology, possibly including alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachycardia. Continuing metoprolol, holding hydralazine, and diurezing with the goal of maximum tolerated output are recommended.

3. Alcohol Abuse: The patient reported a history of delirium tremens with seizures, but it appears he is over this window. Continuing multivitamins, th"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), alcohol abuse, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with bradycardia and acute-on-chronic CHF, managed with fluids initially, but resulted in worsening heart failure. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia and likely CHF exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He was extubated on 6/11 without incident and continues to diurese well. The patient's current medications include lasix, aspirin, chlorhexidine gluconate, docusate sodium, folic acid, heparin, insulin, ipratropium bromide MDI, lansoprazole, lactulose, metoprolol tartrate, multivitamins, propofol, senna, thiamine, and other medications as per the ICU care plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion: The patient had a left pleural effusion in 4/5 and may require further intervention or monitoring.
2. Systolic CHF: The patient's CHF is likely due to an unclear etiology, possibly involving alcohol cardiomyopathy and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Management"
