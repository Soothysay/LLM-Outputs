","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, and coronary ischemia. The patient has a history of nausea/vomiting and allergies to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). She received infusions of Carafate (sucralfate) and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/61 mmHg to 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,905 mL, with 540 mL through the pulmonary artery, 1,365 mL through intravenous fluids, and 707 mL output including 85 mL of urine. The patient's blood products and NG output are not documented. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and neurologic examination findings are not available. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium level of 133 mEq/L, and a serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated at 29%. The patient's platelet count is 236 K/uL, and other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to be managed in the ICU for ACS, unstable angina, and coronary ischemia. The plan includes ongoing ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a code status of full code and no disposition information is provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient's current diagnosis of ACS increases the risk of further myocardial infarction or cardiac complications.
2. Unstable Angina - The patient's symptoms of chest pain or discomfort may worsen, leading to increased angina episodes or progression to a full-blown myocardial infarction.
3. Coronary Ischemia - Reduced blood flow to the heart can result in ongoing chest pain, increased risk of myocardial damage, or the development of a myocardial infarction.
4. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating potential hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of complications.
5. Infection - The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly in the ICU setting. Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent infections such as DVT, stress ulcers, and V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of complete heart block, for which she had a pacemaker placement in [**2166**]. She was admitted to the ICU due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient also has a history of STEMI, asthma, hyperlipidemia, thyroid irradiation, weight loss, glaucoma, and depression.

24-hour events include an increase in her paced rate to 70 bpm to improve cardiac output (CO), and she was started on several new medications. The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral), and she experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. She received infusions of Carafate (sucralfate) and Heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Her current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm (54-72 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 99/61 mmHg (70/44-118/68 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (13-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on room air

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/66 mmHg to 76/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on RA.

The patient has been on heparin sodium prophylaxis since September 16th at 09:45 PM and has also received Carafate (sucralfate) at 08:00 PM on the same day. The patient's medical history includes an allergy to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and they have experienced nausea and vomiting in the past.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature has been within normal range, with a maximum temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F) and a current temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F). The patient's blood pressure is generally stable, although there have been some fluctuations. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and the oxygen saturation remains high at 97%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows that they are receiving fluids through IVF, with a total input of 1,905 mL, including 540 mL of PO, 1,365 mL of IVF, and 707 mL of blood products. The total output includes 707 mL of urine and 237 mL of blood products. The fluid balance is positive at 1,198 mL.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is not currently on any oxygen delivery device, but their SpO2 remains at 97%. The patient's ABG results are not mentioned in the note.

The physical examination findings are limited due to the assessment of peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic function, and other systems not being assessed at this time.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, sodium level of 120 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and glucose level of 120 mg/dL. The creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and the platelet count is 236 K/uL. The troponin-T level is elevated at 29 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and complete heart block treated with a pacemaker. She was admitted to the ICU for acute coronary syndrome and underwent coronary angioplasty with stenting of the left anterior descending artery. She is currently on a regular diet low in sodium, receiving medications for various conditions including hyperlipidemia, asthma, depression, and glaucoma. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 122/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing on examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,905 mL and output of 707 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,198 mL. Close monitoring for signs of fluid overload is important, especially considering her history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 30-35%).

2. Hypotension: Although the patient's current blood pressure is within normal limits, close monitoring is necessary due to her history of hypertension. Any significant drop in blood pressure should be promptly addressed.

3. Respiratory infection: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently wheezing on examination. Regular assessment of respiratory status and prompt treatment of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of myocardial infarction, complete heart block, asthma, hyperlipidemia, thyroid irradiation, glaucoma surgery, depression, deconditioning, and malnutrition. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and acute coronary syndrome. The patient underwent coronary angiography and stenting of the left anterior descending artery. She is currently on multiple medications including Plavix, aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and ranitidine. The patient also has a pacemaker for complete heart block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 69-133 mmHg systolic and 46-70 mmHg diastolic. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications may be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient experienced a recent myocardial infarction and has a history of unstable angina. It is important to monitor her cardiac status and continue with anti-ischemic medications.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reported to be 30-35%, indicating reduced heart function. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and adjusting diuretic therapy may be required.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of complete heart block and is currently paced"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's blood pressure (SBP) decreased to the 90s and urine output (UOP) decreased to 25-35 ml/hr for a few hours overnight. The SBP responded to a 500 cc fluid bolus, and UOP improved to 80-100 ml/hr. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical conditions including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypotension, myocardial infarction, alteration in nutrition, and a history of pacemaker for complete heart block.

Physical examination shows the patient is in no acute distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 70-71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93-133/56-70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient has distant heart sounds with normal S1S2, and there is minimal generalized tenderness over the abdomen. No signs of infection or other fluid collections are noted. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 34.6%, platelet count of 236 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 29/. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR within normal range, elevated CK/CKMB, and calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels within normal range.

Assessment and plan include hypotension not in shock, acute myocardial infarction, alteration in nutrition, and acute coronary syndrome. The patient is on multiple medications including Plavix, aspirin, beta blockers, statin, ranitidine, albuterol nebs, levothyroxine, Ensure supplements, and fluoxetine. Prophylaxis includes PT consult, DVT ppx with heparin SQ, and bowel regimen with colace. The patient's disposition is pending resolution of above, transfer to [**Hospital1 2259**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and ACS, which increases the risk of further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating and has been as low as 90s, indicating potential hypotension, which can lead to organ perfusion issues.
3. Malnutrition/deconditioning: The patient has alteration in nutrition and a history of weight loss, indicating a possible risk for malnutrition and deconditioning, which can affect overall health and recovery.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
5. Infection: The patient has a foley catheter, which increases the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical details and assessments may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of potential medical complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension since admission, with blood pressure readings ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 122/75 mmHg. Despite being on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, the patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/INR of 12.4 and PTT of 33.4, indicating a significant alteration in coagulation function.

The patient's laboratory results reveal several abnormalities, including elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin-T (334 U/L) and CK-MB (29 U/L), suggesting ongoing myocardial damage. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 6.7 K/uL, while platelet count is within normal range at 236 K/uL.

The patient's electrolyte levels show hypokalemia (potassium 3.8 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (sodium 135 mEq/L), which may contribute to cardiac dysrhythmias. Additionally, the patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 140 mg/dL.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range (36.3 C), heart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of STEMI, complete heart block, pacemaker placement, asthma, hyperlipidemia, thyroid irradiation, weight loss, glaucoma surgery, depression, and malnutrition. The patient presented with hypotension and decreased urine output, which responded to a fluid bolus. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina, coronary ischemia, and myocardial infarction (MI). The MI was caused by a lesion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent catheterization and was treated with balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the distal LAD. 

The patient's current medications include Plavix, aspirin, beta blockers, Simvastatin, and levothyroxine. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Physical examination revealed a patient in no acute distress, with a paced rhythm, distant heart sounds, and normal S1 and S2. The abdomen was soft with minimal generalized tenderness and no distension. The extremities showed an inguinal hematoma resolving without signs of infection.
