   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They presented with a brisk upper bleed, likely originating from the left nasal passage. The patient has a history of liver disease, including varices that may have recently bled, and a duodenal ulcer that is not actively bleeding. There are also concerns about possible cholecystitis, hematuria, and social issues related to being in jail without family visitation rights.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Risk: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration. This could be exacerbated by the use of propofol and mechanical ventilation.
2. Massive Bleeding/EPISTAXIS: The patient experienced a significant bleed, likely caused by trauma from NG tube placement in the context of coagulopathy from cirrhosis and regular use of Motrin. The patient has been given a balloon to control the bleeding, and follow-up with ENT recommendations is planned.
3. Varices: The patient has large-sized varices despite having undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. These varices pose a risk of further bleeding.
4. Cholecystitis: There are suspicions of cholecystitis, and further evaluation, including obtaining RUQ and MRCP reports, is needed.
5. Hematuria: Although the patient currently does not have hematuria, it should be monitored,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They presented with a brisk upper bleed, likely originating from the left nasal passage. The patient has a history of liver disease and is suspected to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is evidence of recent bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, possibly from varices or a duodenal ulcer. The patient is also experiencing hematuria. They have been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to an inability to protect their airway, and there is a risk of aspiration. The patient has been sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of further aspiration and respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding: The patient has experienced a massive bleed due to epistaxis, likely caused by trauma from a nasogastric (NG) tube placement. There is also evidence of recent bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting possible varices or a duodenal ulcer.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, as indicated by an elevated INR and low platelet count. This increases the risk of further bleeding.
4. Liver disease: The patient has underlying liver disease, which may contribute to the development of portal hypertension and subsequent bleeding from varices.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive procedures, such as"

   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on

   treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an
   MRCP, read still pending at [**Hospital1 2570**]. He had a NGT placed for unclear
   reasons that caused nose bleeding and coughing up blood.  Today the
   patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L).
   He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and previous TIPS procedure for variceal bleeding. He presents with hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, and jaundice for two months. A CT scan showed evidence of varices in the spleen and esophagus, cirrhosis with a questionable mass, and a soft tissue density in the bladder. He has had multiple hospital visits due to abdominal pain and was treated with Motrin and Tylenol for pain. An outpatient cystoscopy was planned but was postponed due to abdominal pain. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low-grade fevers, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. He also had treatment for possible cholecystitis and underwent an MRCP. A NGT was placed for unclear reasons, causing nose bleeding and coughing up blood. Today, the patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood. He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to the ED. The patient has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours, with no signs of current bleeding. His baseline HCT was 35 at an outside hospital. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, with a urine output greater than 30 ml/hr. He is still on meropenem. The bleeding from the nose and possible variceal bleed is still unclear. The"

   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

   HCV Viral Load: 70,000
   ENT:Keep balloon in place until [**2-16**]
   Tagged RBC Scan:entirely negative
   Liver U/S:TIPS looks patent, velocity in reasonable range, numerous
   nodular structures in the liver
   OSH Records/MRCP:Put on Meropenem empirically for concern that patient
   looking more toxic/encephalpathic
   MRCP: 2/8/09Impression: Extensive multifocal HCC, signal abnormality in
   liver (majority of right lobe) causing biliary ductal dilation in right
   lobe w/extension of this mass into the portal vein. Very cirrhotic
   heterogenous liver with multiple nodules, concerning aspect is the
   signal abnormality invasing the veins but also with mass effect on the
   biliary ducts. Has TIPS; low signal in the TIP shunt at the portal
   venous end; TIPS might be partially occluded; get U/S to confirm
   thrombus. Distension/thickening of GB wall (can see this in cirrhosis
   vs CCY but no reason to think of acute ccy), has varices, small amount
   of ascites

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presents with hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, and jaundice. He has undergone various tests, including a CT scan that showed evidence of varices in the spleen and esophagus, cirrhosis with a possible mass, and soft tissue density in the bladder. The patient has also had multiple hospital visits due to abdominal pain and has been treated with Motrin and Tylenol for pain. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low-grade fevers, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been treated for possible cholecystitis and underwent an MRCP, the results of which are still pending. He has also had a NGT placed for unclear reasons, causing nose bleeding and coughing up blood. Today, the patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood. He was intubated and transferred to the ED.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. He presented with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated due to continued bleeding in the ED. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he experiences episodes of tachycardia. There is ongoing bleeding via the left nare"

   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

   Currently off sedation on trial of PSV
   Tagged RBC Scan:entirely negative
   Liver U/S:TIPS looks patent, velocity in reasonable range, numerous
   nodular structures in the liver
   OSH Records/MRCP:Put on Meropenem empirically for concern that patient
   looking more toxic/encephalpathic
   MRCP: 2/8/09Impression: Extensive multifocal HCC, signal abnormality in
   liver (majority of right lobe) causing biliary ductal dilation in right
   lobe w/extension of this mass into the portal vein. Very cirrhotic
   heterogenous liver with multiple nodules, concerning aspect is the
   signal abnormality invasing the veins but also with mass effect on the
   biliary ducts. Has TIPS; low signal in the TIP shunt at the portal
   venous end; TIPS might be partially occluded; get U/S to confirm
   thrombus. Distension/thickening of GB wall (can see this in cirrhosis
   vs CCY but no reason to think of acute ccy), has varices, small amount

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein extension. The patient's TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) is not functioning well. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an endotracheal tube in place. They are also receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and codeine. Their vital signs show tachycardia and elevated body temperature. The patient has right lower extremity edema but no left lower extremity edema. Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and other abnormalities. Imaging shows no infiltrates and the endotracheal tube is in good position. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection, but there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed has not been resolved, and the TIPS is not functioning properly. There is a potential for continued bleeding or re-bleeding.
3. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression: The patient has extensive multifocal HCC with portal vein extension, indicating advanced disease with potential complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a fever, and there is a suspicion of"

   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent. Patients HCt has been stable
   overnight.  Currently presume bleed is nasopharyngeal in origin but
   likely had some variceal  bleeding

   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well.
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Will need to start PO lactulose as PR not adequate; if not extubated
   will need to place NGT
   -Trend LFTs
   -Consider adding Rifaxamin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with epistaxis (nosebleed). He has a history of TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) for a prior variceal bleed. The patient underwent an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was intubated due to ongoing bleeding. He experienced episodes of tachycardia and had a large amount of bright red blood emesis. Esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleed were found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), but no active bleeding was observed. A tagged red blood cell scan did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding or upper GI/LGI bleed. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable overnight, and the TIPS is patent. 

The patient also has HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) with multifocal disease and elevated AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) levels. He is not a candidate for liver transplantation and has hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU for respiratory failure, which occurred due to possible aspiration of blood during emesis. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, and broadened coverage with Vancomycin has been added to the antibiotic regimen. 

The patient has thrombocytopenia and a coagulopathy"

   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   and platelets trending down today and received 1Uprbcs overnight.
   -- Protonix IV BID, d/c octreotide gtt
   -- Continue serial Hct q6, transfuse<27
   --NP Balloon removed today during rounds
   --Resume nadolol today given NGT is now in place
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well.
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Start PO lactulose now that ngt in place
   -Trend LFTs
   -Start Rifaxamin 400 TID today
   #Fever- Persistantly febrile, no clear source of infection although
   does have ascites in abdomen; ddx SBP vs pneumonia vs line infection.
   U/A negative.
   -Will add Flagyl
   -Continue levo/vanc
   -F/U culture data
   -D/C femoral cordis and send for culture
   -D/C Aline
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia Currently doing well on [**5-6**]
   --Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime
   --MS prohibitive to SBT/extubation currently; thus giving lactulose to
   improve hepatic encephalopathy
   --Discuss with family code status prior to extubation
   #. DIC: Pt fibrinogen 93 and INR 1.8, likely [**2-3**] consumption
   coagulopathy
   -Add haptoglobin given dropping Hct and concern for hemolysis
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of

HCC: extremely poor prognosis, no therapeutic options. Discussed with
   GI and oncology.
Decreased uring output: improved with IVF. Will start on maintenance
   IVF.
Fever: will send urine, repeat blood, and stool culture. To cover
   potential SBP will continue levofloxacin and add flagyl. d/c cordis,
   d/c A-line place central line.
Respiratory failure: no clear source of pneumnia or consolidation,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. There is no clear source of pneumonia or consolidation, and extubation is pending clearing of mental status.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient is unresponsive and sedated, which suggests encephalopathy. Lactulose has been started to manage this condition.

3. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output was initially low but improved with intravenous fluids. Maintenance IVF will be started to prevent further decrease in urine output.

4. Fever: The patient had a fever overnight, and cultures have been sent for urine, blood, and stool to identify the cause of the fever. Levofloxacin and flagyl have been added to cover potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

5. Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) Bleed: The patient had an episode of UGI bleed, but currently, there is no active bleeding visible. However, the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been trending down, possibly indicating ongoing blood loss or hemolysis. A blood smear will be sent to investigate further.

6. Epistaxis: The patient experienced epistaxis, but there is no evidence of active bleeding after removing the nasal catheter. ENT input is appreciated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decreased urine output (U/O), fever, respiratory failure, and epistaxis. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with multiple interventions including sedation, intubation, ventilation, and various medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolysis: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been trending down, raising suspicion of possible hemolysis. A blood smear has been sent to investigate this further.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.
3. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection and potential hemolysis, the patient is at risk of developing sepsis. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is no clear source of pneumonia or consolidation. Extubation may be considered once the patient's mental status improves.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy requires ongoing management with lactulose and low-dose propofol. Monitoring for any changes in mental status is essential.

   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   remains stable and no further bleeding.
   -- Protonix IV BID, Octreotide for 5D

   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well. Oncology
   consulted and felt prognosis very poor on the order of weeks
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Continue Lactulose
   -Continue Rifaxamin
   #Fever- Persistantly febrile, no clear source of infection although
   does have ascites in abdomen; ddx SBP vs pneumonia vs line infection.
   U/A negative.
   -Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl
   -F/U culture data
   -A line removed
   -Will need to remove cordis
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia Currently doing well on [**5-6**]
   --Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime/flagyl
   --Will have ongoing family discussion prior to removing tube although
   pts MS improving

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presents with epistaxis. The patient underwent endoscopy and was found to have esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleeding, but no active bleeding. He also had a duodenal ulcer that was injected. A tagged RBC scan did not show any active bleeding site. The patient's Hct remains stable and there is no further bleeding.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient had hematemesis and was intubated due to continuous bleeding in the ED. The source of bleeding is presumed to be esophageal varices, although there may have been some bleeding from a duodenal ulcer as well. The bleeding has been controlled for now, but the patient is at risk for further bleeding if the underlying causes are not addressed.

2. HCV Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and has undergone TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) for a prior variceal bleed. The patient's liver function tests indicate abnormal levels of liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin, and albumin, which suggest ongoing liver dysfunction. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy, which requires ongoing management with lactulose.

3. Hepatocellular Carcinoma"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with epistaxis. He underwent intubation due to ongoing bleeding and was found to have esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleeding, but no active bleeding at the time. A tagged red blood cell scan did not show any active bleeding site. The patient has a MELD score of 13 and extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with concern for HCC mass compressing part of the TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). The patient's prognosis is poor, on the order of weeks according to oncology consultation. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy and is not a transplant candidate. There are several other medical complications and conditions present, including thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's goals of care need to be readdressed, and ongoing family discussion is planned prior to removing the endotracheal tube. The patient's condition requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed due to esophageal varices.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with potential compression of TIPS.
4. Respiratory failure and possible aspiration pneumonia.
5. Thrombocytopenia likely due to splenic"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis

   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   remains stable and no further bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and previously experienced a variceal bleed. The recent episode of epistaxis and the presence of esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleed indicate a high risk for further GI bleeding. Close monitoring and ongoing management are necessary to prevent rebleeding.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to possible aspiration of blood during emesis. There is evidence of aspiration pneumonia on chest X-ray, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to manage this condition.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated MELD score (13) suggests impaired liver function, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of confusion, altered mental status, and jaundice further support this diagnosis. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued as part of the management plan.

4. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): The patient has multifocal HCC, making him a poor candidate for transplantation. Given the poor prognosis and the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, palliative care options should be discussed with the patient and family.

5. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has persistently febrile temperatures, despite"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presents with epistaxis. He was previously admitted for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, but there is currently no evidence of active bleeding. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) after discussing the poor prognosis with the family. He is receiving morphine for pain management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/78 mmHg to 96/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and bilirubin levels, along with decreased albumin and platelet count. Blood cultures have been obtained. Imaging studies reveal extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a concern for HCC mass compressing part of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).

The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to the advanced stage of HCC. Oncology has been consulted, and the prognosis is very poor, estimated to be in the order of weeks.

The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and previous TIPS placement. He is currently on comfort"
