   readmitted to [**Hospital1 5**] from rehab with recurrent aspiration, transferred
   to the MICU with hypoxia.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxia: Given acuity of decompensation on the floor and his hx
   of recurrent aspiration, this most likely represents another aspiration
   event or a progression in the pneumonitis secondary to the event for
   which he was admitted. Also could be progression of PNA, but pt is
   already on broad gram postive and gram negative covg.
   - switched from dapto/[**Last Name (un) **] to linezolid/[**Last Name (un) **] for lung penetration
   - low suspicion for PE as was anticoagulated
   - continuing to have intermittent hypoxic episodes, likely from
   progressive pneumonia
   - consider eosinophilic pneumonia as etiology and follow peripheral eos
   - may need intubation if does not improve
   - lasix as needed to keep dry; flashes with movements

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent prolonged intubation for aspiration pneumonia, readmitted to the hospital with recurrent aspiration, and transferred to the MICU with hypoxia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), leukocytosis, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), impaired skin integrity, and an epidural abscess post L5-S1 laminectomy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent aspiration events leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Progression of pneumonia, which may require intubation if there is no improvement.
3. Development of eosinophilic pneumonia as an etiology for the symptoms.
4. Possible adverse reactions to antibiotics due to previous reactions.
5. Complications related to the epidural abscess, such as neurological damage or spread of infection.
6. Myoclonic jerks without seizure activity, which should be monitored by the neurology team.
7. Lower extremity weakness and pain due to neurological damage or generalized deconditioning.
8. Contracture in the left leg at the knee.
9. Right arm swelling with a superficial cephalic vein clot, without the presence of DVT.
10. Persistent diarrhea, which is negative for Clostridium difficile infection.
11. Thrombocytosis and coagulopathy, which should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
12. Potential development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right arm due to previous superficial clot.
13. Impaired glycemic control due to various factors such as infection, stress, and medications.
14. The need for continued pain management for both acute and chronic pain.
15. The patient's altered mental status, which should be further evaluated and managed by the neurology team.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and address these potential complications promptly to ensure optimal care and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory decompensation. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been experiencing severe pain, fever, and requires face mask at 70% FiO2 due to respiratory failure. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The patient's allergies include ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on multiple medications including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, high fever, and elevated blood pressure. The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and respiratory support. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and deranged renal function. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for potential complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory decompensation and requirement for face mask at 70% FiO2 indicate ongoing respiratory distress. If not managed appropriately, the patient may develop further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has"

   .
   # Acute Hypoxia: Given acuity of decompensation on the floor and his hx
   of recurrent aspiration, this most likely represents another aspiration
   event or a progression in the pneumonitis secondary to the event for
   which he was admitted. Also could be progression of PNA, but pt is
   already on broad gram postive and gram negative covg.
   - continue vanco/meropenem, consider adding clindamycin
   - low suspicion for PE as was anticoagulated
   - does not require intubation at this point; would be hesitant about
   NIPPV given recurrent aspiration
   - being treated for flu on the floor, DFA ordered, low suspicion
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent prolonged intubation for aspiration pneumonia, readmission to the hospital with recurrent aspiration, and transfer to the MICU with hypoxia. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory decompensation, with new infiltrate on chest X-ray and the need for a face mask at 70% FiO2. The patient responded to Lasix and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to Hct drop to 20.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem. The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown signs of acute respiratory failure, possibly due to recurrent aspiration or progression of pneumonitis. Continuous monitoring and support may be required.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis could indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigations might be necessary.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores. Regular turning and pressure relief measures should be implemented.

4. Myoclonic jerks: The patient is experiencing myoclonic jerks without seizure activity. Neurological evaluation and follow-up are recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration.
- He was initially admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and has been on respiratory support.
- He has a history of pneumonia due to aspiration and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient is also diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
- There is a possibility of other etiologies such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and eosinophilic pneumonia.
- The patient has small amounts of hemoptysis and requires significant oxygen support, making bronchoscopy not feasible at the moment.
- Other medical issues include superficial venous clot, endocarditis, mental status changes, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure if the underlying cause (such as pneumonia or other respiratory conditions) is not effectively managed.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's diagnosis of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, there is a risk of further deterioration in organ function and potential development of septic shock.
3. Endocarditis: The presence of endocarditis increases the risk of systemic infection and potential embolic events.
4. Venous clot: The superficial venous clot requires local treatment to prevent further complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to various factors including sepsis, endocarditis, or embolic events. Close monitoring is necessary to identify any acute changes.
6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was initially admitted to the floor for ongoing fever, but developed increasing respiratory distress and desaturation to low 80s on the floor. He was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and is currently stable on 40% face tent. The patient denies any shortness of breath and feels well.

The patient has a history of pneumonia and aspiration, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He has hypoxemia, suspected aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent fevers. His peripheral eosinophil count is mildly elevated. He is currently being treated with linezolid and meropenem for MRSA pneumonia, and osteltamavir for suspected H1N1 influenza. However, his cough and chest PT are poor, and he may require bronchoscopy.

The patient also has a superficial venous clot in his right cephalic vein and a history of endocarditis on daptomycin. His mental status has improved since admission, possibly due to small infarcts/emboli. He also has leukocytosis, which could be related to pneumonitis. Further evaluation and follow-up are recommended.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include suspected aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute (not AR"

   Critical Care Attending Addendum
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 2506**] with the ICU team, whose note from above
   reflects my input.  Complex case of a 76 y/o man with recent aortic
   valve VRE endocarditis, epidural abscess s/p laminectomy, and recurrent
   aspiration now presents with increasing hypoxemia and respiratory
   distress in the setting of high-grade fever.  Although aspiration is
   perhaps most likely, progression of pulmonary parenchymal opacities is
   unusual and could suggest diseases like eosinophilic disease, COP,
   alveolar hemorrhage, etc.  It is possible that he could tolerate an
   awake bronchoscopy, but the risk of intubation is very high.  We
   discussed this with him and family, and they did not wish to proceed.
   Will continue present antibiotics, await cultures and DFA, and send
   serologies.  I feel that the risks of empiric steroids outweigh
   benefits at this point, given his known endocarditis, likelihood of
   infection, etc.  Appreciate ID
s help.  Other issues as per the ICU
   team note from today and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7826**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU. The patient has been critically ill, with respiratory distress and high-grade fever. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including linezolid and meropenem. There are concerns about the progression of pulmonary parenchymal opacities, which could suggest various diseases such as eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's mental status has improved with familiar faces. He has a superficial venous clot in the right cephalic vein, being treated locally. There is also a concern for endocarditis, and a repeat TTE is pending. The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement is significant, indicating a potential respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including high-grade fever and worsening lung opacities on chest X-ray, suggest a possible pneumonia.
3. Aspiration: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration raises concerns about the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
4. Endocarditis: The patient has a known history of VRE"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.

24-hour events include blood cultures drawn, PICC line placement, urine culture drawn, and sputum culture drawn. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including linezolid, meropenem, and aztreonam. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.0 F, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 150/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and their ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 103, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood cultures were positive at 03:18 PM on [date], 04:34 PM on [date], 08:44 PM on [date], and 04:09 AM on [date]. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with leukocytosis, acute and chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The plan includes pain control, glycemic control, nutrition support, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure indicates a potential complication of impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction suggests an ongoing infection. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics are crucial to prevent septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and positive blood cultures indicate a possible ongoing or recurrent infection in the respiratory tract. Antibiotic therapy and respiratory support may be required.
5. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an immune response to infection or inflammation. Close"

   inconsistent with this diagnosis.  Given progression and recurrent
   fevers cannot r/o other etiologies incl BOOP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, and eosinophilic pna.  Yesterday developed small amounts
   of hemoptysis.   Seems less likely c/w alveolar hemorrhage given
   improvement overnight.  Currently oxygen requirement too significant to
   consider bronchoscopy.
    I discussed with the family the prospect of bronchoscoy which they are
   considering.  They were at the bedside and clearly understand the risks
   of waiting.  Now that Mr. [**Known lastname 2506**] is improved will plan to re-check CXR
   and re-assess.

   however, is worrisome for a possible [**Location (un) 10225**]
s hump in the RUL. Patient
   has had two episodes of hemoptysis today. He is non smoker.
   On exam, patient is comfortable with nasal oxygen supplementation.
   Chest is resonant to percussion with good air movement bilaterally. No
   wheeze or rhonchus. S1 and S2 normal. No gallop or murmurs. Abdomen
   soft without guarding or tenderness. Right leg with 1-2+ edema.
   I am concerned that the patient may have had pulmonary emboli as part
   of his respiratory decompensation and as explanation for his
   hemoptysis. Would proceed with CTA (with proper preparation of kidneys
   in light of mild renal failure) to assess for clot and to get better
   assessment of lung parenchyma as well. Would continue with present
   antibiotics for associated pneumonia. I do not think a bronchoscopy
   will be revealing at this time re: the hemoptysis; doubt lung ca in
   lifelong non smoker.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU. The patient is critically ill with progressive hypoxemia, hemoptysis, and recurrent fevers. He has a history of VRE endocarditis and is currently on linezolid and meropenem. He also has a superficial venous clot in the right cephalic vein, being treated locally. The patient's mental status has improved, likely due to small infarcts/emboli previously noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement is significant, and there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism as an explanation for his respiratory decompensation and hemoptysis. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) is planned to assess for clot and get a better assessment of the lung parenchyma.
2. Fevers: The etiology of the fevers is unclear, possibly related to a pulmonary process, including infectious or non-infectious causes. Further evaluation is needed, and the possibility of bronchoscopy may be considered after the patient's condition improves.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of VRE endocarditis, which requires completion of a 6"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypoxemia and a history of pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis, and impaired skin integrity. They were admitted to the ICU and received various treatments including antibiotics, pain management, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs have been monitored closely, showing a fever, increased heart rate, and stable blood pressure. Fluid balance, oxygen saturation, and respiratory parameters have also been monitored. Laboratory tests reveal elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function. The patient's pain control and glycemic control have been addressed. Multiple lines have been placed for medication administration and fluid management. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia have been implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and ongoing respiratory support. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia should be closely watched.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections. Regular skin assessment and appropriate pressure relief measures are essential.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of severe sepsis indicates an increased risk of recurrence. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are crucial to prevent septic shock.
4. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of pneumonia, there is a risk of recurrent or worsening infection. Adequate respiratory support and appropriate"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's main concern is hypoxemia, which is initially attributed to aspiration pneumonia. However, the chest X-ray pattern is inconsistent with this diagnosis, and other etiologies such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and eosinophilic pneumonia need to be considered. The patient also developed small amounts of hemoptysis, indicating possible lung damage.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) endocarditis affecting the aortic valve. It is mentioned that the patient will continue on linezolid and await repeat transesophageal echocardiography (TTE) for further evaluation.

3. Superficial venous clot: The patient has developed a superficial venous clot in the right cephalic vein. Local therapy will be administered to address this issue.

4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has improved, possibly due to small infarcts/emboli previously noted. Further evaluation and consultation with neurology/neurosurgery may be necessary.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Further evaluation with urine analysis (UA) and cultures may be required to determine the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics empirically for H1N1 SWO infection. He has a known allergy to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and aztreonam. His last doses of antibiotics were meropenem and linezolid. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia and requires supplemental oxygen through a face tent. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,391 mL and total output of 2,925 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,535 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent with an SpO2 of 98%. An arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, and PaO2 of 60 mmHg. The patient's physical examination shows well-appearing, no acute distress, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds, and"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent prolonged intubation for aspiration pneumonia, readmitted to the hospital with recurrent aspiration, and transferred to the MICU with hypoxia. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected aspiration event or progression of pneumonia. The patient has been improving after aggressive chest physical therapy. He is also being treated for an epidural abscess s/p L5-S1 laminectomy, lower extremity weakness, myoclonic jerks, lower extremity pain, and right arm swelling.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration and pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory function.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased nutritional status.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of endocarditis and spinal abscesses, there is a risk of systemic infection and sepsis.
4. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a high platelet count, which may increase the risk of thrombotic events.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has persistent diarrhea, which could be caused by antibiotic use or an underlying gastrointestinal condition.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, which may increase the risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis, severe organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic pain, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including furosemide, hydromorphone, and neurontin for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a risk of sepsis recurrence and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient has chronic pain, which needs to be addressed and managed appropriately to improve comfort and quality of life.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia indicates a possible ongoing respiratory infection that requires monitoring and appropriate treatment.

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent laminectomy, prolonged intubation for aspiration pneumonia, readmission to the hospital with recurrent aspiration, and transfer to the MICU with hypoxia. The patient has multiple medical problems including pain control, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, sepsis, and lower extremity weakness.

24-hour events include an echo showing no vegetation and old apical hypokinesis. The patient is not responsive and has a history of pneumonia and aspiration. Pain service recommended increasing Neurontin and considering Amitriptyline at night. Allergies include ampicillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and aztreonam.

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals impaired peripheral vascular function and skin integrity. Neurologic examination shows no response to stimulation and abnormal movement, tone, and reflexes. Labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures are positive for VRE.

Assessment and plan include acute hypoxia likely due to recurrent aspiration or progression"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 .H/O SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   76 yo M with VRE endocarditis (abx course completed), spinal abcesses
   s/p laminectomy, recent prolonged intubation for aspiration PNA,
   readmitted to [**Hospital1 5**] from rehab with recurrent aspiration, transferred
   to the MICU with hypoxia.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxia: Given acuity of decompensation on the floor and his hx
   of recurrent aspiration, this most likely represents another aspiration
   event or a progression in the pneumonitis secondary to the event for
   which he was admitted. Also could be progression of PNA, but pt is
   already on broad gram postive and gram negative covg.
   - switched from dapto/[**Last Name (un) **] to linezolid/[**Last Name (un) **] for lung penetration. Will
   continue for 8 d course starting [**11-10**].
   - much improved s/p aggressive chest PT; now on room ir
   - CT scan shows bilateral pleural effusions and has hx of [**Numeric Identifier 2380**] BNP, so
   could represents component of CHF
   - lasix today, 10mg IV, can continue PRN, would be aggressive with
   diuresis
   - some concern for vasculitic/inflammatory process given atypical
   appearance of CXR & concomittant reanl failure; will spin urine
   .
   # Hemoptysis: probably secondary to either MRSA pneumonia, now being
   covered with the linezolid vs. hemoptysis secondary to CHF; hct stable,
   respiratory status stable.
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: afebrile 48 hrs now. Likely unrelated to prior
   VRE as course completed or spinal process as no interval change.  Could
   be rxn to pneumonitis vs PNA.  Treatment as above
   - tx as above
   - f/u UCX, BCX, SCX
 no growth to date
   - stopping osteltamivir as results from state lab are negative for flu
   - ID following
 asked for CRP/ESR; which are high
   .
   # Epidural abscess s/p L5-S1 laminectomy: MRI unchanged
   -we were continuing daptomycin - therapy goes until [**11-14**]
 but now is
   switched to linezolid; no need for further treatment once the PNA abx
   course is completed.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Being worked up by floor team w/ neuro c/s and
   EEG. He is actually much more lucid and conversant than he was prior to
   transfer to rehab. Suspect that this is a slow recovery s/p two weeks
   of intubation, but appreciate neuro's continued input.
   .
   # Myoclonic jerks: Myoclonus with no seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Lower extremity weakness: The patient presents with lower extremity
   weakness that per neurosurg was similar to his last admission. It
   likely relates to neurological damage and generalized deconditioning.
   Appears to have contracture in left leg at knee
   .
   # Lower extremity pain:
   -Continue gabapentin.
   -pain consult appreciated: uptitirating dilaudid, may add amitryptiline
   if MS continues to improve
   .
   # HTN
 stable, has been on hydral, Norvasc and metoprolol in past; not
   receiving here because BP stable; will d/c everything but metoprolol
   for now.

   # Right arm swelling: The patient was noted to have a superficial
   cephalic vein clot on his right arm without the presence of DVT during
   an ultrasound on his last admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxia and is being treated for MRSA pneumonia, CHF, and sepsis. The patient's symptoms include pain, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, altered mental status, myoclonic jerks, lower extremity weakness, lower extremity pain, right arm swelling, transaminitis, coagulopathy, thrombocytosis, and diarrhea. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration events and history of pneumonia increase the risk of further aspiration and subsequent lung infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the bilateral pleural effusions and the recent episode of hypoxia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) indicate an ongoing inflammatory response, which could be related to an unresolved infection or sepsis.
4. CHF: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and a history of heart failure raise concerns for congestive heart failure exacerbation.
5. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of superficial cephalic vein clot and may be at risk for deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, recent laminectomy, prolonged intubation for aspiration pneumonia, readmission to the hospital, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the MICU with hypoxia and has multiple medical problems including acute hypoxia, fevers/leukocytosis, epidural abscess, altered mental status, myoclonic jerks, lower extremity weakness, lower extremity pain, right arm swelling, transaminitis, coagulopathy, thrombocytosis, and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and history of recurrent aspiration suggest a possible acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or progression of pneumonitis.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers and leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection, potentially related to the previous VRE endocarditis, spinal abscesses, or a new source.
3. Vasculitic/Inflammatory Process: The atypical appearance of the chest X-ray and concomitant renal failure raise concerns for a vasculitic/inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed, including urine spinning.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status, myoclonic jerks, and lower extremity weakness may be related to neurological damage from prolonged intubation, previous laminectomy"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of VRE endocarditis (aortic valve), epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including linezolid and meropenem for suspected H1N1 infection. He also has a history of allergies to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and aztreonam.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/52 to 121/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received heparin sodium prophylaxis and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) infusions.

Physical examination findings include the patient appearing well with no acute distress, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds with a II/VI systolic murmur, limited pulmonary exam due to pain with movement, diffuse bilateral rhonchi anteriorly, and 2+ lower extremity edema with tenderness. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to the patient's condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Radiology images show continued progression of bilateral peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, which are inconsistent with aspiration pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has developed small amounts of hemoptysis but seems less likely to have alveolar hemorrhage given the overnight improvement. There is a discussion about the possibility of bronchoscopy to further evaluate the cause of hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement is significant, making it challenging to consider bronchoscopy at the moment. The underlying cause of hypoxemia needs to be determined promptly to guide further management.
2. Fevers: The etiology of the patient's fevers remains unclear, and it is uncertain whether they are related to a pulmonary process, possibly infectious or non-infectious. The recent improvement suggests that disciitis is not a further issue.
3. Superficial venous clot: The patient has developed a superficial venous clot in the right cephalic vein, which requires local treatment.
4. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of VRE endocarditis, and although a recent echocardiogram did not show evidence of further endocarditis, ongoing antibiotic therapy is required.
5. Mental status: The patient's mental status has improved, likely due to small infarcts/emboli previously noted."

   Assessment and Plan:
   76M w/ h/o VRE endocarditis (AoV), epidural abscess s/p laminectomy,
   with progressive hypoxemia, hemoptysis, and fevers, now improved.
   1.Hypoxemia
originally attributed to aspiration PNA./ [**Last Name (un) 10170**]
   syndrome.  CXR initially showed continued progression of b/l peripheral
   opacities but began to improve on [**11-12**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be a component of
   aspiration but CXR pattern is inconsistent with this diagnosis.  Other
   etiologies incl BOOP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pna,
   and alveolar hemorrhage seem less likely given rapid improvement.  CT
   with impressive b/l effusions and improvement concordant with diuresis
   (and abx).  Prior BNP 11k.  Question whether improvement is due to
   diuresis plus treatment of bacterial infection.   UA w/o evidence of
   dysmorphic reds/casts.
      -cont linezolid/meropenem.
      -Cont osteltamavir given for possible H1N1.
      - poor cough, chest PT.
      -Still awaiting [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA although capillaritis seems less likely.

   3. Endocarditis
 on dapto, now linezolid to complete 6wks
 TTE w/o
   evidence of further endocarditis.
   4. Mental status
 improved by accounts of team that know him well .
   Likely [**1-17**] improvement of small infarcts/emboli previously noted.
   5. CRF- Cr stable, monitoring post CT I+.  Unclear significance of

   Patient is critically ill.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) endocarditis, epidural abscess post laminectomy, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the floor for ongoing fever and developed increasing hypoxia, leading to his transfer to the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes two recent hospitalizations and he is well-known to the ICU staff. During his prior admission, he had fevers thought to be due to aspiration pneumonitis. In the emergency department, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was inserted and he was started on empiric treatment for H1N1 swine flu outbreak infection.

The patient has been receiving various medications including linezolid and meropenem for his bacterial infection. He also received oseltamivir for possible H1N1 infection. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/57 to 147/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-appearing with no acute distress, regular S1, S2 heart sounds, and a II/VI systolic murmur. He has minimal bilateral rhonchi posteriorly and bilateral basilar rales. The patient has"
