   Chief Complaint: Sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   - The final CT abd/pelvis showd a multiseptated cystic lesion in the
   tail of the pancreas, given appearance without associated duct dilation
   would favor serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN. Radiology recommend
   comparison with priors if available or endoscopic ultrasound.  Tumor
   markers were ordered for the am.
   - CT also showed mild left uretral enhancement with surrounding
   inflammatory change, which could represent ureteritis. Recommend
   followup ureteroscopy after appropriate treatement
   - The patient continued to require levophed, it was weaned down,
   however her SBPs were in the 80's.  She briefly responded to a 500 cc
   bolus of fluid, however she looked volume overloaded, so her levophed
   was increased instead of more fluids for pressure support.
   - Repeat lactates were down from 3.6 --> 2.0 --> 1.0.
   - VBG checked and was 7.30/48/41/25 in the am; repeat in the evening

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 86 year old female with PMH of
   uncontrolled DM who presented with one day of LLQ discomfort, n/v/AMS,
   now with hypotension and likely urosepsis. CT showed multiseptated
   cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas - which is suggestive of
   serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN.  Mild left ureteral enhancement
   was also seen with surrounding inflammatory change that may represent
   ureteritis. Patient continuing to require some pressor support but is
   otherwise stable.
   # Sepsis: Likely urinary source given CT findings and positive UA.  On
   Vanc and Zosyn while cultures are pending
   - IVF/levophed to maintain MAP>65, was weaned off pressor support
   yesterday but pressures were in 80's (asymptomatic) and given her
   hypervolemic status, levophed was restarted
   - Check CVP, maintain at 8-12
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, cultures pending, will follow up
   # Hypotension: In the setting of infection/sepsis.  Levophed as above.
   Was responsive to 500cc fluid bolus but appeared to be getting volume
   overloaded.
   - Holding lisinopril
   - IVF/pressors as above, will wean as tolerated, cautious fluids
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving at 1.1 this morning down from 1.4.
   Likely in the setting of hypoperfusion.  Baseline creatinine appears to
   be around 1.1-1.2.
   - Continue to trend
   - IVF as able to maintain perfusion
   - will hold off on sending urine lytes as improving with bp support and
   fluids
   # Pancreatic Mass:  Seen on CT- multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail
   of the pancreas - which is suggestive of serous cystic pancreatic tumor
   or IPMN.  Tumor markers send yesterday
   - f/u tumor markers
   - consider endoscopic ultrasound for better visualization
   # Transaminitis:  Improving, was likely in the setting of hypotension
   - continue to trend
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold statin for now given transaminitis in the
   setting of hypotension, sepsis
   # Type II DM: On metformin at home, patient reports she has had some
   difficulty transitioning to this medication, unclear why.
   - Hold metformin for now
   - ISS, can add long acting insulin if needed versus insulin gtt
   - QID FS

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who presented with lower left quadrant discomfort, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and hypotension. She is likely experiencing urosepsis, as indicated by the CT scan showing a multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas and mild left ureteral enhancement with surrounding inflammatory change. The patient requires some pressor support but is otherwise stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which may lead to sepsis. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam while awaiting culture results.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is a concern and may be related to the infection/sepsis. Levophed is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible acute renal failure, which may be due to hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Pancreatic mass: A multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas was observed on CT scan. Further evaluation, such as tumor markers and endoscopic ultrasound, is recommended.
5. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes were noted, which are likely due to hypotension. Monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with lower left quadrant discomfort, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, hypotension, and likely urosepsis. The CT scan revealed a multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas, which is suggestive of a serous cystic pancreatic tumor or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Mild left ureteral enhancement with surrounding inflammatory change was also observed, which may represent ureteritis.

The patient continues to require some pressor support but is otherwise stable. She has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis, possibly of urinary origin given the CT findings and positive urine analysis (UA). She has been receiving vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) while cultures are pending.

The patient's hypotension has been managed with levophed, and she responded well to a 500 cc fluid bolus but appeared to be getting volume overloaded. Therefore, the levophed was increased instead of administering more fluids for pressure support.

The patient's acute renal failure is resolving, as indicated by a decrease in creatinine from 1.4 to 1.1. This is likely due to hypoperfusion. The baseline creatinine appears to be around 1.1-"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 96/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable with a CVP of 19 mmHg.

The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, hyperglycemia, and a pancreatic mass/cystic lesion. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, bandemia, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has a history of hyperglycemia and requires close monitoring and maintenance below 150 mg/dL.

The patient is currently on vasopressor support and is being managed for sepsis, hypotension, acute renal failure, and elevated liver function tests. The pancreatic mass/cystic lesion requires further evaluation with additional imaging and consideration for a GI consult for possible endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy.

The patient's nutritional support, glycemic control, and fluid management are being monitored and adjusted as needed. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots and systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2"

   now with hypotension and likely urosepsis. CT showed multiseptated
   cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas - which is suggestive of
   serous cystic pancreatic tumor or IPMN.  Mild left ureteral enhancement
   was also seen with surrounding inflammatory change that may represent
   ureteritis. Patient has been stable off pressors for 24 hours.

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who presented with symptoms of lower left quadrant discomfort, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and hypotension. She was diagnosed with sepsis, likely of urinary origin, and was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The urine culture grew GNR bacteria, and she will continue with Zosyn while awaiting sensitivity results.

Her blood pressure has been stable for 24 hours without the use of pressors. She is currently being held on lisinopril, and it is planned to initiate a blood pressure regimen once she is transferred to the floor.

The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, with her creatinine level decreasing from 1.4 to 0.9. This was likely due to hypoperfusion. Her baseline creatinine appears to be around 1.1-1.2.

A CT scan revealed a multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas, which is suggestive of a serous cystic pancreatic tumor or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Her CA125 level is within normal range at 14 (normal range 0-35). It is planned to consider an endoscopic ultrasound for better visualization and surgery for possible biopsy.

The patient has experienced diarrhea, which is believed to be a result of the bowel regimen given for constipation. This is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who presented with lower left quadrant discomfort, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and hypotension. She is suspected to have urosepsis. A CT scan showed a multiseptated cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas, which is suggestive of a serous cystic pancreatic tumor or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The patient has been stable off pressors for 24 hours. She has been diagnosed with sepsis likely from a urinary tract infection (UTI), hypotension, acute renal failure, and a pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to a suspected UTI. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs and laboratory values closely. Antibiotics should be continued as prescribed, and cultures should be reviewed for sensitivity patterns.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable for 24 hours off pressors. However, hypotension can still occur as a complication of sepsis or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions should be done to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level was elevated but has resolved at 0.9 this morning. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to detect any further deterioration. Fluid management"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently showing signs of improvement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is off vasopressors and is able to sit up and eat. They have no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for hyperglycemia. Their physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, and no signs of distress or pain.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 122 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low sodium, and normal kidney function. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's conditions that have resolved include sepsis, hypotension, and acute renal failure. They still have elevated liver function tests, a pancreatic cystic lesion, hyperglycemia, and require fluid repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: Despite improvement, the patient is still at risk for infections due to their compromised immune system.
2. Pancreatic issues: The presence of a cystic lesion in the pancreas may require further evaluation and management, including the possibility of malignancy.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels need to be carefully monitored and managed to prevent hypoglycemia.
4. Fluid imbalance: Close monitoring of the patient's intake and output is necessary to maintain fluid balance and prevent complications such as fluid overload or dehydration.
5. DVT: As the patient is critically ill and immobilized, there is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to decreased blood flow in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as boots and systemic anticoagulation should be continued.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the critical illness and should receive appropriate prophylaxis.
7. VAP: The patient should have their head of bed elevated to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
