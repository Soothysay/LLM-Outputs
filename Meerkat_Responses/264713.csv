   Assessment and Plan
   This is Mrs.[**Known lastname 6373**] 5th intubation in 5 months. During previous
   admissions, she was made DNR/I by her HCP though she continues to be
   re-intubated. This is her 3rd episode on respiratory failure in the
   past month and a half. It has been decided already that a trach will
   not be pursued.
   There is no hope that Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] will achieve an acceptable quality of
   life with further invasive and aggressive medical care. She has
   demonstrated that she is no longer able to breath independently for
   periods longer than a week or two. The decision has been made to avoid
   trach placement thus the best possible outcome is repeated episodes of
   respiratory failure followed by short periods of breathing
   independently. We will therefore focus our care upon the comfort and
   dignity of Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] and not treat her aggressively beyond that. This
   approach can be validated by other members of the ICU team and shared
   with the niecce once a concensus has been established. The pain and
   discomfort caused by the care provided over the past month and a half
   far outweighs the shortlived clinical improvements that have been
   transiently achieved.
   For now, she has received antibiotics in the ER and as noted above is
   already on the vent.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 93-year-old woman, has been admitted to the ICU multiple times in the past six months due to respiratory failure. She was intubated again in the emergency room and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history is significant for multiple admissions with respiratory failure, and she has been made DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) by her healthcare provider. The decision has been made to avoid tracheostomy placement and focus on comfort care. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, and she is receiving antibiotics and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the legs.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring infections from healthcare-associated sources while in the ICU.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to her critical condition and the effects of mechanical ventilation.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's unresponsiveness and inability to follow commands suggest potential neurological issues that may worsen over time.
7. Malnutrition: P"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia and a recent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection. She presented with shortness of breath and fever. Due to her multiple comorbidities, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and further resuscitation are not indicated. The focus of care will be on comfort measures, and the plan is to wean the ventilator with the goal of extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although prophylaxis for DVT is not mentioned in the note, given the patient's prolonged immobility and hospitalization, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT and considering appropriate prophylaxis may be important.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient's age and multiple hospitalizations make her more susceptible to nosocomial infections. Close monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate management will be crucial.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are essential to prevent this complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is Mrs.[**Known lastname 6373**] 5th intubation in 5 months. During previous
   admissions, she was made DNR/I by her HCP though she continues to be
   re-intubated. This is her 3rd episode on respiratory failure in the
   past month and a half. It has been decided already that a trach will
   not be pursued.
   There is no hope that Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] will achieve an acceptable quality of
   life with further invasive and aggressive medical care. She has
   demonstrated that she is no longer able to breath independently for
   periods longer than a week or two. The decision has been made to avoid
   trach placement thus the best possible outcome is repeated episodes of
   respiratory failure followed by short periods of breathing
   independently. We will therefore focus our care upon the comfort and
   dignity of Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] and not treat her aggressively beyond that. This
   approach can be validated by other members of the ICU team and shared
   with the niecce once a concensus has been established. The pain and
   discomfort caused by the care provided over the past month and a half
   far outweighs the shortlived clinical improvements that have been
   transiently achieved.
   For now, she has received antibiotics in the ER and as noted above is
   already on the vent.

   detail the inability of Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] to live off the ventilator when she
   has a fever or infectious process.  We also discussed the large sacral
   ulcer which cannot be cured with antibiotics alone.  She wishes to
   extubate and if Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] fails extubation she will be made CMO.  If
   she passes extubation she will be continue on a course of abx for UTI
   and tube feeds continued and she will be transferred back to her NH
   with a do not transfer back to the hospital order.  If she fails again
   at the nursing home she will be transitioned to comfort directed care.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is Mrs.[**Known lastname 6373**] 5th intubation in 5 months. During previous
   admissions, she was made DNR/I by her HCP though she continues to be
   re-intubated. This is her 3rd episode on respiratory failure in the
   past month and a half. It has been decided already that a trach will
   not be pursued.
   There is no hope that Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] will achieve an acceptable quality of
   life with further invasive and aggressive medical care. She has
   demonstrated that she is no longer able to breath independently for
   periods longer than a week or two. The decision has been made to avoid
   trach placement. We will therefore focus our care upon the comfort and
   dignity of Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] and not treat her aggressively beyond that. This
   approach can be validated by other members of the ICU team and shared
   with the niece once a concensus has been established. The pain and
   discomfort caused by the care provided over the past month and a half
   far outweighs the shortlived clinical improvements that have been
   transiently achieved.
   Discussed care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2138**] and that her current respiratory status
   is back to where she was prior to her last extubation.  We discussed in
   detail the inability of Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] to live off the ventilator when she
   has a fever or infectious process.  We also discussed the large sacral
   ulcer which cannot be cured with antibiotics alone.  She wishes to
   extubate and if Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**] fails extubation she will be made CMO.  If
   she passes extubation she will be continue on a course of abx for UTI
   and tube feeds continued and she will be transferred back to her NH
   with a do not transfer back to the hospital order.  If she fails again
   at the nursing home she will be transitioned to comfort directed care.

","The patient, Mrs. [**Known lastname 2930**], is a 93-year-old female admitted to the ICU multiple times within the past 6 months for respiratory failure. She has been intubated on this occasion and has had a PICC line placed. The patient has severe kyphosis, and her lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 mmHg to 116/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Depakote (Oral) and unknown allergies. She has received infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. Other medications include those given in the ICU. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory failure. Her flow sheet data shows normal vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and urine output. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia and an recent ESBL urinary tract infection. She presented with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection symptoms. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated yesterday. She is currently breathing comfortably on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/48 to 121/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and a stage 4 sacrum decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and extubated multiple times, indicating a history of respiratory failure. This could be due to altered mental status in the setting of infection or other underlying respiratory conditions.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an ESBL E. coli infection in her urine, which is sensitive to bactrim. Changing antibiotics to bactrim for a 10-day course is planned to treat the UTI.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable, and there is no immediate plan to address anemia. However"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia and recent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI). She presents with shortness of breath and UTI. She has been intubated and extubated multiple times and is now successfully extubated. Her current vital signs are stable, with an oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula and breathing comfortably. She is being treated with meropenem for the UTI, and her blood sugar is well-controlled. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and she will be transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and repeated intubations, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. GNR UTI: The patient has a current Gram-negative rod (GNR) UTI, which is being treated with meropenem. There is a potential for antibiotic resistance or treatment failure.
3. Anemia: Although the patient's Hct is stable, there may be a risk of developing anemia due to chronic illness or ongoing blood loss.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and decreased nutritional status can increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia and recent ESBL urinary tract infection. She presented with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection symptoms. The patient was intubated and extubated multiple times due to respiratory failure caused by altered mental status in the setting of infection. She is now successfully extubated. Her current vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and a stage 4 decubitus ulcer on the sacrum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure requiring multiple intubations and extubations. There is a potential risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to her altered mental status and underlying infections.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an identified ESBL-producing E. coli infection in her urine. If not effectively treated, this UTI could lead to complications such as sepsis or kidney injury.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but monitoring for anemia is necessary. If left untreated, anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen-carry"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with a history of sacral decubitus ulcer, recurrent pneumonia, and esbl urinary tract infection. She presented with respiratory distress and was previously intubated but is now extubated and doing well with restarted tube feeds. The patient has a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, fever, decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, and chronic diastolic heart failure. She also has dementia and is currently on DNR/DNI status with goals of care readdressed. The patient's UTI is being treated with meropenem, and her respiratory failure has resolved likely due to poor mental status. The sacral decubitus ulcer is stable and wound care will continue. The patient's blood sugar levels are well controlled, and she is receiving proper nutrition through tube feeds. She will be transferred to rehab today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pneumonia: Given the patient's history of recurrent pneumonia and current respiratory distress, there is a potential for future episodes of pneumonia.
2. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient already has a sacral decubitus ulcer present at admission. It is essential to monitor and manage the wound care to prevent further complications.
3. UTI: The patient has an esbl urinary tract infection. Proper antibiotic therapy should be continued, and regular urine cultures should be obtained to monitor for any changes or recurrence.
4. Heart failure: The patient has chronic diast"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 93-year-old female with several medical conditions including sacral decubitus (pressure ulcer), recurrent pneumonia (pna), and an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, likely due to poor mental status, and there is no evidence of active pna. The sacral decub is stable, and wound care should be continued.

The patient's goals of care have been readdressed, and she is now documented as DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate) but not CMO (Comfort Measures Only), indicating that she can receive antibiotics and tube feeds. The UTI should be treated with the addition of [Last Name (un)] sensitivities and continued with [Last Name (un)] for now, possibly switching to zosyn or bactrim.

The patient's vital signs are generally within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/48 to 121/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 399 K/uL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, glucose of 84 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride of 23.0%, and magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL.

Imaging and microbiology reports are available, indicating an ESBL E. coli UTI and no new imaging findings.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, clear breath sounds, soft and distended abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, muscle wasting, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds inadequately.

In summary, the patient is a 93-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who has improved from respiratory failure but still requires management for her UTI and sacral decubitus ulcer. Her goals of care are DNR/DNI but not CMO, allowing for the continuation of certain interventions such as antibiotics and tube feeds."
