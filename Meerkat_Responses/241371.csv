   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 11 day course for VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) with complications including post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory failure, and presumed lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory compromise. He has a decreased hemoglobin level (Hct) and requires blood transfusion. The patient also has a left ventricular (LV) thrombus, for which anticoagulation therapy has been initiated. He is currently on multiple medications, including Cefepime, Zosyn, Sotalol, and Heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and daily chest X-rays will be performed. The patient may need weaning off the ventilator once his condition improves.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient has bright red blood at the rehabilitation facility while on heparin gtt, which has been stopped. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the hospital did not reveal any source of upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). The differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and malignancy. The trend in Hct suggests oozing rather than active bleeding, but further evaluation by gastroenterology is needed.

3. LV Thrombus/PE: The patient has evidence of an LV thrombus on echocardiography, which requires anticoagulation therapy. He also had a PE post-operatively. Anticoagulation with heparin has been resumed, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered due to the high risk of recurrent PE.

4. History of CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, including a cardiac arrest in 2014. He is currently on Sotalol, and his cardiac function is being monitored with echocardiograms showing a 40-45% ejection fraction (EF) with apical and anterior akinesis.

5. Borderline Diabetes Mellitus: The patient requires insulin supplementation for glycemic control.

6. Other Issues: The patient's mental status is unclear, and an MRI and EEG are planned to assess long-term prognosis. His blood pressure is low, and there is a concern for sepsis or sedation-related hypotension. Vasopressin and norepinephrine are being used to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient's family will be consulted for discussions regarding goals of care, including the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the hospital after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and was found to have a post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation. The patient also has a presumed lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) and is showing signs of respiratory failure due to over sedation after a fracture leading to aspiration and hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 233 K/uL. Other lab values include sodium of 139 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, chronic gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB), lower gastrointestinal bleed with hematochezia, bradyrh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current conditions include aspiration pneumonia (asp pna), pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and uncertain mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressin, heparin, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG shows possible seizure activity, so continuous EEG monitoring and anti-seizure treatment will be planned. An MRI may also be needed to assess the extent of cerebral function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and can be caused by pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, or COPD. Empiric antibiotics will be continued, and cultures will be followed up. Diuretics may be considered cautiously due to the patient's dependence on vasopressors. Nebulizers will be scheduled for COPD management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is reasonable but there is uncertainty about the need for pressors. It will be considered to wean off vasopressin and use Levophed if mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 65.
4. GI bleed"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, uncertain mental status, refractory hypotension on vasopressin, and previous issues such as aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/68 mmHg to 135/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. The blood glucose level is also elevated at 186 mg/dL. Imaging studies show bilateral hilar infiltration and effusions on chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram reveals an ejection fraction of 45% with apical and anterolateral akinesis, but no left ventricular thrombus.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuron with intact brain stem function. MRI done and
   results pending. EEG shows seizure activity, now s/p loading with
   Fosphenytoin- on final read of EEG no seizure activity and slowing
   suggestive of encephalopathy. MRI without evidence of anoxic brain
   injury
   -Continue Fosphenytoin for now pending neuro recs, pt has ongoing EEG
   monitor in place
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin at 7pm tonight prior to next dose
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required vasopressin
   and then levophed, howver now off since 9am today and BP stable so far
   -Resume  Levophed prn to maintain MAP>65
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus- hold at MN prior to trach
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now , plan for PEG

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and required prolonged intubation due to post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and is presumed to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). 

The patient's respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has been treated with various antibiotics based on sputum cultures and has ongoing hypotension.

The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and atrial fibrillation (AF). His ejection fraction (EF) is 45% with anterior akinesis on echocardiogram.

The patient also has borderline diabetes mellitus (DM) and requires insulin sliding scale due to being NPO. 

The patient's altered mental status is not consistent with delirium, and he is experiencing respiratory failure, chronic gastrointestinal bleed, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GIB), and has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening hypotension, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuron with intact brain stem function. MRI done and
   results pending. EEG shows seizure activity, now s/p loading with
   Fosphenytoin.
   -Continue Fosphenytoin and check levels?
   - f/u neuro
   - F/U MRI
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Persistant despite
   IVF bolus; now weaned off vasopressin and started levophed
   -Continue Levophed MAP>65
   -F/U Culture data
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however given slow down
   trend in Hct suspect oozing.
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   - GI following; plan for possible c-scope pending neuro status/goals of
   care
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight; f/u result b/c if evidence of clot will need
   IVC filter prior to Trach/Peg by IR
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The patient underwent surgery and developed a post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation. The patient also experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and was diagnosed with a presumed lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB).

The patient's current condition includes mental status changes, respiratory compromise due to multiple factors including COPD, aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a recent left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient has been treated with different antibiotics, including cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), for suspected infections.

The patient's hypotension is attributed to various causes such as infection (elevated white blood cell count, left-sided pneumonia on CXR), sedation, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's cortisol level is elevated, and vasopressin has been weaned off. Levophed has been started to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and a previous cardiac arrest. An echocardiogram (echo) showed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus and apical and anterior akinesis. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, uncertain mental status, refractory hypotension, and possible seizure activity. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Seizure Activity: The patient has been started on fosphenytoin for possible seizure activity, indicating a risk of seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring should be continued to monitor for any seizure activity.
3. Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, it is essential to continue monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability and potential recurrence.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and ongoing monitoring and management are required to prevent re-bleeding and manage any complications.
5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). Close monitoring of cardiac function and appropriate management of these conditions are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, mental status, and hemodynamic parameters. Fre"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, uncertain mental status, refractory hypotension, and gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and gastrointestinal bleed. The respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The patient's mental status is uncertain, and there has been seizure activity detected on EEG. However, the final report indicates no seizure activity but shows slowing suggestive of metabolic/toxic encephalopathy. 

The patient's blood pressure has been refractory to vasopressin, and he required levophed and a line placement. Hypoxemia was transiently resolved spontaneously. 

The patient's cardiac status includes CAD, chronic heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count. The liver enzymes are within normal range, but the electrolytes show some imbalances. 

Imaging studies reveal bilateral effusions and interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray, and negative lenis (likely referring to a CT scan of"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuro
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin this AM
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and required prolonged intubation due to post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has experienced multiple complications including a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) level, presumed lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB), aspiration pneumonia/Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a left ventricular (LV) thrombus/PE.

Medical Complications:
1. Mental Status: The patient shows no evidence of anoxic brain injury, but there is a possibility of metabolic encephalopathy. EEG and MRI results are normal.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. He has been treated with appropriate antibiotics based on sputum culture results.
3. LGIB: The patient has bright red blood per rectum while on heparin gtt, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Hct levels have dropped, and he received packed red blood cells (prbcs). The source of bleeding could not be visualized during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), so the differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or malignancy. However, the Hct level is currently stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuron
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin at 7pm tonight prior to next dose
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day __ 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now , plan for PEG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The patient required prolonged intubation due to a post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been experiencing a drop in hemoglobin levels (Hct) and presumed lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).

The patient's mental status is described as no evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic encephalopathy. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy. MRI results did not show any evidence of anoxic brain injury. It was decided to discontinue Fosphenytoin, confirm with neurologist, and check phenytoin at 7 pm tonight prior to next dose.

The patient has undergone a tracheostomy (Trach) and is now experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. He was initially treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes, and then his antibiotics were changed to Zosyn after a repeat chest X-ray (CXR) showed a new left-sided infiltrate. The antibiotics were continued for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient will complete a 10-day course of antibiotics."

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of neurologic symptoms. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple medical complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has right and left lower extremity edema, which may indicate the development of DVT.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower end, indicating potential hypotension.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's sodium, potassium, and calcium levels are abnormal, indicating possible electrolyte imbalances.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk of bleeding.

These are potential complications based on the provided information, but further assessment and diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm their presence."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -goal even to -500cc
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to
   intubate from above for the nex 10 days
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -GI recs- no plans for inpatient scope. Plan for outpatient workup if
   stable
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   - holding aspirin
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) complicated by post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation and a presumed lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB).

The patient has been treated with cefepime for an infection caused by Enterobacter aerogenes, followed by a switch to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His antibiotic regimen has been completed, and he has shown improvement in his white blood cell count.

The patient's mental status is described as altered, possibly due to metabolic encephalopathy. There is no evidence of anoxic brain injury based on an MRI. The neurologic plan includes continuing phenytoin for seizure prevention, checking phenytoin levels daily, and following up with neurologic recommendations.

Respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Hypotension has resolved, but there was a previous infection (elevated WBC, left-sided pneumonia on chest X-ray) versus sedation versus gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Cortisol random was 22, and vasop"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuro
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin this AM
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular (LV) aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's medical history includes aspiration pneumonia (asp pna), pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed).

The patient is currently in the ICU with several active issues, including persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and uncertain mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/79 mmHg to 158/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination shows movement of head and arms spontaneously, no tracking or purposeful response to voice, clear tympanic membranes, regular rapid regular rhythm, clear lung sounds, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and 1+ edema throughout. Neurological examination reveals spontaneous movements but no purposeful response.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin levels between 9.0 g/dL and 27.7%, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -goal even to -500cc
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to
   intubate from above for the nex 10 days
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -GI recs- no plans for inpatient scope. Plan for outpatient workup if
   stable
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   - holding aspirin
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He required prolonged intubation and developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) that led to a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient also had gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which was initially suspected to be upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), but no source was found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) was later identified as the cause of the bleeding.

The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by pneumonia/HAP, aspiration, COPD exacerbation, and multifactorial respiratory failure. He has undergone multiple interventions, including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and central venous line placement.

The patient's cardiovascular system has been affected by an anterior wall myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombus formation. He has received anticoagulation therapy, but developed a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's diabetes has been managed with sliding scale insulin due to his inability to take oral medications.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He required prolonged intubation and developed postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE), which led to a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels and mental status changes. The patient also has lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), a left ventricular thrombus (LV thrombus), and a history of atrial fibrillation (a.fibb). He has been treated with various antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has been on anticoagulation therapy for the LV thrombus and PE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy and is expected to continue requiring respiratory support.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resulted in a significant drop in Hct levels. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of the bleeding and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Left Ventricular Thrombus: The patient has a left ventricular thrombus, which requires ongoing anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
4. Prolonged Intubation: The patient has been intubated for an extended period"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's hospital course has been notable for aspiration pneumonia (asp pna), pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient was transferred for further evaluation with additional active issues including persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and uncertain mental status.

The patient's recent events include the placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line, overnight diuresis with Lasix, changing ventilator mode back to assist-control (AC), holding heparin due to hematuria, and starting fentanyl patch for suspected pain/agitation.

The patient's allergies include Vioxx (oral), hypertension; Protonix (oral), diarrhea; and Furosemide (Lasix).

Physical examination findings include general appearance of being awake but not tracking or interacting, pupils equal, anicteric, tracheostomy site okay, regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops, clear to auscultate bilaterally, abdomen soft but somewhat distended with normal bowel sounds, edema in lower extremities, and unchanged neurologic status with non-interactive behavior.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.7 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 26.6%, platelet (Plt) count of 228 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 31 mmHg, glucose level of 112 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Radiology images show a PICC tip at the level of the 2nd rib on the right side with coag negative staph infection, and blood culture being negative.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Depressed mental status due to uncertain cerebral function.
- Consult neurology regarding continued treatment given EEG interpretation.
- Minimize sedation.
- Re-examine daily.
- Turn off propofol.
- Start fentanyl patch for pain.
2. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Continue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- Change antibiotic therapy.
- Consider fluid overload.
- Use heparin for anticoagulation.
- Switch to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) once hematuria clears.
- Provide nebulizers for COPD management.
- Change ventilator mode back to assist-control (AC).
3. GI bleed.
- Monitor serial Hct levels.
- Plan for lower endoscopy.
- Hold aspirin.
- Monitor closely while on lovenox for PE.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB.
- Continue on sotalol.
- Use lovenox for anticoagulation.
- Hold aspirin.
- Review echocardiogram without left ventricular thrombus.
- CXR shows more edema, and more lower extremity edema.
- Administer Lasix for goal negative 1L today.
5. Infectious disease.
- Monitor for low-grade temperature and WBC count.
- Recently finished 14-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP.
- No additional antibiotics for now, but should be monitored closely and cultured if he spikes.

ICU care includes tube feeds at goal, glycemic control with RISS plus basal insulin, arterial line, PICC line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's recent medical history includes aspiration pneumonia (asp pna), pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient was transferred for further evaluation due to persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and uncertain mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/59 mmHg to 178/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including diuresis with Lasix, placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line, change in ventilator mode to assist/control (AC), holding heparin due to hematuria, and starting fentanyl patch for suspected pain/agitation.

Allergies include Vioxx, protonix, furosemide, TUMS, RISS, Albuterol, Atrovent, Lansoprazole, Sotolol, Chlorhex, Dilantin, Colace, Neutraphos, and Fentanyl patch.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, sodium of 112 mg/dL, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 17 mg/dL, magnesium of 30.2%, glucose of 129 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures were negative for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and blood cross.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Depressed mental status: The patient has a depressed mental status, which is uncertain in extent due to cerebral function. It is recommended to touch base with neurology regarding continued treatment given the EEG interpretation and any other recommendations. The patient's sedation should be minimized, and fosphenytoin should be discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU admission following orthopedic surgery. The patient's ICU course has been notable for aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia, persistent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and uncertainty regarding mental status. The patient's current issues include persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and possible subclinical seizure activity detected on EEG. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including Vioxx (Oral) and Protonix (Oral). The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin on December 26th. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/87 mmHg to 110/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,020 mL, including 616 mL through the oral route, 177 mL through the tube feeding route, and 1,623 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 1,832 mL of urine, 190 mL of blood products, and 427 mL of drain output.

   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   72 yo w/ CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic
   surgery- course notable for asp pna, PE, Enterobatcer VAP, persistent
   resp failure, GI bleed. Transferred for further evaluation- additional
   active issues include persistent SVT, uncertain mental status.
   EEG with evidence of possible subclinical seizure activity, so started
   on dilantin per neurology
   24 Hour Events:
   Lasix overnight with effective diuresis
   PICC line placed
   Few apneic episodes overnight so changed ventilator mode back to AC
   Some hematuria so heparin gtt held and hematuria resolved
   Fentanyl patch started for suspected pain/agitation

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo w/ CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic
   surgery- course notable for asp pna, PE, Enterobatcer VAP, persistent
   resp failure, GI bleed. Transferred for further evaluation- additional
   active issues include persistent SVT, uncertain mental status.
   (1) DEPRESSED MENTAL STATUS- per neuro eval, brainstem fxn intact but
   extent of cerebral fxn uncertain.
   - touch base w/ neuro re: continued tx given EEG interpretation (no sz
   activity seen) as well as any other recs
   - minimize sedation --> talk to Neuro about dc/ing fosphenytoin
   - will turn off propofol and re-examine daily.  Propofol now off, and
   he is mildly agitated/moving spontaneously, but no purposeful
   responses. Does not track
   -MRI not suggestive of anoxic injury
   -hold all sedating meds, but fentanyl patch started for pain
   (2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE- persistent; causes include pneumonia, poss
   pulm edema, PE, COPD
   -trach/PEG yesterday
   -Abx d/c yesterday after 14 day course
   -?some fluid overload.  Has been negative without diuretics
   -cautious anticoag w/ heparin gtt for PE. Will change to lovenox now
   that hematuria cleared.
   -COPD appears stable clinically; scheduled nebs
   -back on AC due to apnea.
   (3) GI BLEED- Hct stable
   -GI following, planning for eventual lower scope
   -follow serial hct, goal hct 25
   -ppi [**Hospital1 **], holding ASA
   -monitor closely while on lovenox for PE
   (5) CAD/CHF/ AFIB-
   -on sotalol
   -lovenox for anticoagulation
   -ASA held for now
   -echo reviewed without LV thrombus
   -CXR looks like more edema, and has more LE edema as well. Lasix for
   goal negative 1L today
   (6) ID: low grade temp again today, and WBC count trending up.
   Recently finished 14 day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP.
   No additional antibiotics for now, but should be monitored closely, and
   cultured if he spikes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current conditions include aspiration pneumonia (asp pna), pulmonary embolism (PE), enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient is also experiencing a depressed mental status with uncertain cerebral function and persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

24-Hour Events:
- Lasix was given overnight with effective diuresis.
- A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed.
- The ventilator mode was changed back to assist-control (AC) due to apneic episodes.
- Heparin was held due to hematuria, which resolved after stopping.
- A fentanyl patch was started for suspected pain and agitation.

Allergies:
- Vioxx (Oral) (Rofecoxib)
- Protonix (Oral) (Pantoprazole Sodium)
- Diarrhea
- Furosemide (Lasix) - [**2127-12-27**] 06:45 PM
