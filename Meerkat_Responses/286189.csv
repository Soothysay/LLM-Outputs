   Microbiology: Blood 8/6: NGTD
   Sputum [**9-10**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   1)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD. Per
   her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding but no additional information
   is know at this time. Differential for LGIB includes hemmoroids,
   diverticuliosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD,
   and neoplasm. No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an
   infectious colitis or IBD. Also, IBD would be unusual to present for
   the first time in a 71yo woman. She has no prior history of CAD to
   suggest ischemic colitis. Most likely diverticulitis vs. hemorrhoids.
   Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here. Her baseline Hct is
   between 25-30 but her Hct on admission today of 35.5. Her INR and PTT
   are elevated today.  She is on Aspirin as an outpatient but is not on
   any anti-coagulation (in light of history of atrial fibrillation).
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 PIVs in place
   - GI consult; consider colonoscopy
   - Hold ASA
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse if Hct<25
   - If PTT remains significantly elevated, consider Protamine
   2)Hypotension:  Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs in 80
   possibly lower at dialysis. Unclear how much fluid was removed at
   dialysis. She also had 400cc of BRBPR which may be accounting for her
   transient hypotension.  She received 1L NS in the ED and her BP quickly
   stabilized and remains at baseline. No fevers or chills to suggest an
   underlying infectious process.  Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but this
   was in the setting of renal failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Repeat lactate
   3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**1-11**]. Patient was acutely
   hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%. She was also noted to have
   increased secretions; she likely mucous plugged given acute
   desaturation. Her Upon transfer to the MICU, her respiratory status
   stabilized.  She is currently on 50% trachmask.  No evidence of a
   pneumonia on cxray.
   - Check ABG
   - Sputum cx
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   4)Coagulopathy: Patient presents with elevated INR and PTT. She is not
   on any anti-coagulation or blood thinners as outpatient. These labs may
   have been draw via a line that was flushed with heparin. This may also
   be due to heparin SQ she has been receiving at home.
   - Repeat coags
   5)ESRD on HD: Patient underwent dialysis today but prematurely stopped
   in the setting of BRBPR. Her BP during this time dropped and remained
   below baseline upon transfer to the ED.
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   6)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   7)Anemia: Baseline Hct between 25-30. Hct on admission was 35, which is
   slightly elevated from baseline.  She receives Epogen at HD.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend daily Hct
   8)Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, COPD, ESRD on HD, hypothyroidism, and anemia. She presented with approximately 400cc of bright red blood per rectum at home.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, blood pressure ranging from 121/53-133/83 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on tracheostomy mask.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated WBC count of 12.7 K/uL, Hct levels ranging from 31.6-33.4%, platelet count of 339 K/uL, and various electrolyte imbalances including high levels of sodium, potassium, and low levels of magnesium and phosphate.
- Imaging shows a left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe, but no focal consolidation.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including lansoprazole, antibiotics, and epogen.
- The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), hypotension, respiratory distress, coagulopathy, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, and hypothyroidism.

   # Coagulopathy: Initially transiently elevated, and have since
   normalized on AM labs.  The patient does not take any blood thinners
   except SC heparin.  Possibly systemically absorbed in a cachectic woman
   -Continue to monitor daily coags
   # Hypotension:  Had transient episode of hypotension after HD/ and
   BRBPR, since then BP has remained stable with normal lactates and
   hematocrits, and no fevers
   -continue to monitor clinically
   -Follow up cultures
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   # ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   #COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   #Anemia: Continue outpatient epo
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding), coagulopathy, hypotension, hypoxia, ESRD on HD (end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of LGIB and ongoing bleeding indicated by ""BRBPR"" (blood-tinged red blood cells in the urine) pose a risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation parameters may increase the risk of bleeding or clotting complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's episodes of hypotension may recur, potentially compromising organ perfusion and leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and hypoxia increase the risk of respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, and difficulty weaning off ventilatory support.
5. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on HD indicates significant kidney dysfunction, which may worsen during her stay in the ICU due to various factors like hypotension or infection.
6. Infection: The presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture suggests a risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia or other infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding), coagulopathy, hypotension, hypoxia, ESRD on HD (end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued LGIB: The patient has had recurrent episodes of bleeding, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss and potential shock.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is unstable, as indicated by the transiently elevated PTT. If not properly managed, this could result in excessive bleeding or clotting.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. It may be due to blood loss or other factors.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxia due to mucous plugging, which can compromise oxygenation and lead to respiratory distress.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's inability to tolerate hemodialysis indicates a potential complication in managing her end-stage renal disease. Daily small volume HD may be required if she continues to have issues with tolerating HD.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to factors such as muc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and other comorbidities. She presents with bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and transient hypoxia after dialysis. The patient also has maroon-colored stools indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The sputum culture shows the presence of gram-negative rods, suggesting a possible respiratory infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may indicate a potential respiratory complication. This could be due to mucous plugging or a respiratory infection, as suggested by the sputum culture results.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's maroon-colored stools suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This requires further evaluation and management to identify the source of bleeding and prevent further complications.

3. Infection: The presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture indicates a possible infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy if necessary.

4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of ESRD and GIB may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac status is necessary.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and the need for repeated blood tests and procedures.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and currently presenting with bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and blood-tinged pink frothy red blood cells in the urine (BRBPR). The patient's oxygen saturation dropped acutely to the low 60s, but improved rapidly after bagging. The patient received Benadryl and was given albuterol and atrovent nebs. She also has maroon-colored stool, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/43 to 122/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, and elevated troponin T level. The differential shows increased neutrophils and eosinophils. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. Imaging and microbiology results are not mentioned in the progress note.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxia secondary to mucous plugging, likely caused"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and experiencing several medical events. The patient has a history of unknown allergies and received antibiotics, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and other medications. Vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask. Lab results indicate elevated levels of leukocytes, creatinine, and lactic acid, while other parameters are within normal range. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is being screened to go back to rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are crucial.

2. Infection: The presence of Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive rods in the sputum culture suggests a possible infection. The patient's elevated leukocyte count further supports this possibility. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results, and ongoing monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney function and appropriate management, such as adjusting medication"

   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.
