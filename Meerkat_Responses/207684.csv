","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), chronic kidney disease (Cr 3), and recent Clostridium difficile infection. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. His management is complicated by congestive heart failure (CHF), limiting the ability to provide intravenous fluids. The patient has expressed a desire not to be intubated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia (RLPNA): Healthcare-associated pneumonia with gram-positive rods and cocci identified on sputum culture. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for MRSA coverage, Zosyn for nosocomial gram-negative rods, and azithromycin for Legionella coverage. Further investigations include urine Legionella antigen, chest PT, and repeat CXR. The patient will receive supplemental oxygen.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Follow-up urine cultures are pending.
3. Recent Clostridium difficile infection: The patient will start oral vancomycin while on antibiotics.
4. History of CHF: Judicious intravenous fluid administration will be provided, considering the patient's hypotension, fevers, and likely dehydration.
5. History of hypertension with flash pulmonary edema: Antihypertensive medications will be held, and Lopressor will be added if hypertension occurs.
6. Coronary artery disease:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP), and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40%.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, tachycardia, and poor urinary output. He is receiving IV fluids, norepinephrine, levophed, and antibiotics to cover for HAP and atypical pathogens. The patient also has a large infiltrate in the right lower lobe on the chest X-ray, which is likely the cause of his presenting symptoms.

Additionally, the patient has a history of UTIs and has tested positive for enterococcus in his urine culture. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 4.2, indicating acute on chronic stage IV CKD. He is also experiencing recurrent C. difficile infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU with health-care associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and worsening heart failure. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension, requiring pressor support, and has had episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation overnight. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/48 mmHg to 133/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and central venous pressure of 5 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium. Other lab values such as platelet count, troponin-T, glucose, and cardiac enzymes are also noted.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include hospital-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, increased creatinine levels, history of Clostridium difficile infection, peripheral neuropathy, coronary artery disease, and feeding intolerance. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy until culture data returns, chest physiotherapy, and monitoring of vancomycin trough levels. Renal function tests and medication dose adjustment are recommended due to increased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient presented with symptoms of weakness, lethargy, and cough. He had high fevers and hypotension, which led to the initiation of pressor support. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and atypical pathogens. Sputum culture results showed the presence of Gram-positive rods and budding yeast.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Enterococcus present in his urine culture. He also has chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction of 30-40% and mild mitral regurgitation. He is experiencing pulmonary edema and lower extremity swelling.

The patient's acute condition is complicated by acute-on-chronic stage IV chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level slightly elevated above his baseline of 3.2-3.7 at 4.2. This is likely related to his recent C. diff infection and acute pneumonia/UTI. He has had poor urine output, which may indicate pre-renal azotemia, although it cannot be ruled"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed sepsis, which is currently being treated with antibiotics. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by enterococcus and a history of recurrent C. diff infection. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40% and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has stage IV CKD. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and a history of myocardial infarction with ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is allergic to ACE inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased oxygen requirements, and potential respiratory failure if not adequately treated.
2. Sepsis: With the presence of pneumonia and a positive blood culture, there is a risk of sepsis progressing to septic shock, which can result in organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. UTI: The patient's urinary tract infection may progress to pyelonephritis or cause sepsis if the bacteria ascend to the kidneys or bloodstream.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the 24-hour events indicate that the patient's mental status has improved, and there is a desire to place an arterial line, but the patient does not want it. The patient continues on a pressor but has been weaned down to levo 0.02.

The patient has allergies to prednisone, Isordil (Oral) (Isosorbide Dinitrate), and Ace Inhibitors, as well as renal toxicity associated with antibiotics.

The last doses of antibiotics given were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/19/2114 at 12:00 AM, Azithromycin on 05/19/2114 at 12:00 AM, Vancomycin on 05/20/2114 at 09:00 PM, and Piperacillin on 05/21/2114 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) started on 05/20/2114 at 10:17 PM. Other medications include changes to medical and family history, with a review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 05/21/2114 07:34 AM includes vital signs with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/52 mmHg to 98/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg. Fluid balance shows total input of 1,746 mL and total output of 533 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided. Physical examination findings include general observations of the patient sleeping, opening eyes to voice, oriented x3, and neck that is supple with intra-arterial line in place. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a soft systolic murmur. Lung examination shows bronchial breath sounds at the left base, and abdominal examination reveals slight right lower quadrant tenderness. Extremities show 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. Skin examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results include white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.7 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 86 K/uL, creatinine of 4.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27.5 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 97 mEq"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3. He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with a prior myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with high fevers and hypotension indicates sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly managed. This may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. UTI: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and positive urine culture suggests ongoing infection, which could contribute to sepsis if not effectively treated.
4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF and current presentation with pulmonary edema indicate a high risk for exacerbation of heart failure, leading to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and poor urine output suggest"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40% and mild mitral regurgitation, leading to pulmonary edema and lower extremity swelling. He also has acute-on-chronic stage IV chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 4.2, likely related to C. diff and acute pneumonia/urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient has a healthcare-associated pneumonia/sepsis with a large infiltrate in the right lower lobe on chest X-ray, which is the likely cause of his presenting symptoms of weakness, lethargy, and cough. He also has a urinary tract infection with Enterococcus species.
- The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral neuropathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Pneumonia in setting of chronic renal disease and chronic heart
   failure.  Developed worsening fluid overload in setting of worsening
   CRF.  CXR and exam consistent with fluid overload.   Diuresis less
   effective because of A/CRF
 trial lasix drip and  afterload
   reduction.   Cont Bipap as required.   Creatinine up today
 gentle
   diuresis to avoid worsening CRF further though of course balanced by
   need to manage CHF.  Renally dose meds.  Follow for electrolyte
   abnormalities, acid/base, intractable fluid overload as indications for
   consideration of dialysis.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Remains critically ill.
   Time spent on care: 45 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia and is now experiencing pulmonary edema and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema/Acute Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and pulmonary edema. His current symptoms include hypervolemia, lower extremity swelling, and worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient's EF is 30-40%, and there is 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient needs afterload reduction, which will involve increasing carvedilol and adding hydralazine. A PICC line should be obtained, and the patient should start on lasix gtt today. Monitoring of blood pressure is important, aiming for a goal BP of 120's, as the patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema with hypertension. BIPAP should be continued PRN, transitioning to NC today if tolerated.

2. Acute on Chronic Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated above his baseline of 3.5-3.7 at 4.2. This could be related to previous C. diff and acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with healthcare-associated right lower lobe pneumonia, now presenting with pulmonary edema and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema/Acute Systolic CHF: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 30-40%, mitral regurgitation (MR), and evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Hypervolemia and lower extremity swelling are also noted. The patient is unable to diurese due to ARF. The plan includes afterload reduction, increasing carvedilol, adding back hydralazine, obtaining a PICC line, starting lasix gtt, checking urine Na+, monitoring blood pressure, and transitioning from BIPAP to NC if tolerated.

2. Acute on Chronic Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated above baseline at 4.2, likely related to C. diff and acute PNA/UTI. The patient has poor urine output and is likely pre-renal, although atrial nephropathy (ATN) cannot be ruled out. The plan includes checking urine Na+, starting lasix gtt, considering hemodialysis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (Cdiff), and chronic renal failure (CRF). He was admitted with right lower lobe pneumonia and has now developed worsening acute-on-chronic renal failure along with progressive pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 145/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on BiPAP. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include mild dyspnea, crackles in the chest, symmetric extremity pulses, confusion, and warm skin. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and blood urea nitrogen, as well as low hemoglobin and leukocyte count. The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, with elevated sodium and chloride levels.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the worsening of his condition. The patient has multiple allergies, including prednisone, Isordil, ace inhibitors, and rash.

The patient has been on various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, ranitidine, morphine sulfate, lorazepam, and heparin sodium. The plan includes titrating the"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and HPI are not provided. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure (CRF), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pulmonary edema, urinary tract infection (UTI), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/47 mmHg to 162/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a bipap mask, set at CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 641 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and lactate, along with low levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC), and platelets. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with high levels of sodium and chloride, and low levels of calcium and magnesium.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of chronic renal failure, fluid overload"
