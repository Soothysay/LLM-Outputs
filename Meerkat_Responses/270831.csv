","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), where a thrombus was removed and a bare metal stent (BMS) was placed. The patient's ECG and cardiac catheterization findings correlated, indicating extensive cardiac ischemia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs showing sinus tachycardia, blood pressure slightly low, and normal respiratory rate. She is receiving nitroglycerin drip and has been started on metoprolol for rhythm control. The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with regular insulin sliding scale due to her diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Post-mi arrhythmias: Given the extensive cardiac ischemia and the presence of significant q waves on ECG, the patient is at high risk for post-myocardial infarction arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring in the cardiac care unit (CCU) for arrhythmias is recommended.

2. Cardiogenic shock: Although the patient is currently hemodynamically stable, her blood pressure is slightly low. There may be an element of cardiogenic shock due to the moderate left ventricular diast"

   demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angigoraphically
   apparent disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal portion
   of the vessel after the D1 which had a very hig take off point. The
   LAD was filled with thrombus up to the first septal branch. The Cx
   had no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had no
   angigraphically
   apparent disease.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
   rpessures with an LVEDP of 25 mmHg. The central aortic pressure was
   100/67 mmHg. There was no transvalvular gradient of pullback from the
   LV
   to the aorta.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Unclear why this patient had a total LAD occlusion. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable.
   Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of decompensated heart
   failure or cardiogenic shock. She complains of pleuritic chest pain.
   She is at high risk for post-mi arrythmia/pericarditis
   - monitor in CCU for arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output; gave one dose this AM that was c/b by relative
   hypotension. Continue to hold BB.
   - aspirin, plavix, integrilin x 18 hours
   - lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - on nitro drip for symptoms
   - ECG in AM
   - echo looks like apical LV dysfunction with preserved RV function, f/I
   final
   .
   2. PUMP: no signs of fluid overload but BP is low suggesting some
   element of systolic failure
   - f/u echo
   - holding beta blockade for now
   - start ace inhibitor when stable
   - if needed, slow fluids to maintain blood pressure, although currently
   is hemodynamically stable
   .
   3. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain which can be related to a PE (however she
   is not hypoxic, allowing for the effect of supplemental 02).
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   - echo to evaluate right heart strain
   .
   4. DM:  patient with BG up to 500 at OSH, AG of 12. Falling o/n to 11.
   - hold oral agents
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - if sugars peristantly elevated, will use insulin gtt overnight

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed one-vessel coronary artery disease with a total occlusion in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
- Thrombus was removed from the LAD, and a bare metal stent (BMS) was placed. The patient's ECG territory correlates with the findings on cardiac catheterization.
- The patient is currently on a nitroglycerin drip for symptomatic relief and has been prescribed aspirin, Plavix, and Integrilin for 18 hours.
- She has also been prescribed Lipitor 80mg PO daily, and an echocardiogram showed apical left ventricular dysfunction with preserved right ventricular function.
- The patient is being closely monitored for arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers have been held temporarily due to relative hypotension.
- Other medications include regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and she is also on prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Post-mi arrhythmias/pericarditis: The patient is at high risk for these complications, so close monitoring in the critical care unit (CCU) for arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and an ECG in the morning"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction).
- She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed one vessel coronary artery disease. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was totally occluded due to thrombus formation, but this was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a bare-metal stent (BMS).
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is not mentioned in the note, but an echocardiogram showed apical LV dysfunction with preserved RV function.
- The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and she is at high risk for post-MI arrhythmias and pericarditis.
- She is currently on nitroglycerin drip for symptom relief and will continue to be monitored in the CCU for arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient's glucose levels were elevated, and she is being managed with insulin therapy.
- She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
- The attending physician reviewed the case and agreed with the treatment plan, including the possibility of pericarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Imaging: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
   system
   demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angigoraphically
   apparent disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal portion
   of the vessel after the D1 which had a very hig take off point. The
   LAD was filled with thrombus up to the first septal branch. The Cx
   had no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had no
   angigraphically
   apparent disease.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
   rpessures with an LVEDP of 25 mmHg. The central aortic pressure was
   100/67 mmHg. There was no transvalvular gradient of pullback from the
   LV
   to the aorta.
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal LAD with a 2.5x23mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.0mm distally and 3.5mm in the proximal and mid stent.
   4. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a 6F
   Angioseal device.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Successful PCI of the LAD with BMS.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Unclear why this patient had a total LAD occlusion. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable.
   Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of decompensated heart
   failure or cardiogenic shock. She complains of pleuritic chest pain.
   She is at high risk for post-mi arrythmia/pericarditis
   - monitor in CCU for arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output; gave one dose this AM that was c/b by relative
   hypotension. Continue to hold BB.
   - aspirin, plavix, integrilin x 18 hours
   - lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - on nitro drip for symptoms
   - ECG in AM
   - echo looks like apical LV dysfunction with preserved RV function, f/I
   final
   .
   2. PUMP: no signs of fluid overload but BP is low suggesting some
   element of systolic failure
   - f/u echo
   - holding beta blockade for now
   - start ace inhibitor when stable
   - if needed, slow fluids to maintain blood pressure, although currently
   is hemodynamically stable
   .
   3. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain which can be related to a PE (however she
   is not hypoxic, allowing for the effect of supplemental 02).
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   - echo to evaluate right heart strain
   .
   4. DM:  patient with BG up to 500 at OSH, AG of 12. Falling o/n to 11.
   - hold oral agents
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   - if sugars peristantly elevated, will use insulin gtt overnight
   .
   5. FEN: cardiac, diabetic diet
   .
   6. PPX: SC Heparin, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The note details the patient's medical history, current medications, and laboratory results. It also includes information about the cardiac catheterization procedure performed, which showed one vessel coronary artery disease and successful placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the LAD (left anterior descending) artery.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for post-mi arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, holding beta-blockers due to hypotension, initiating aspirin, Plavix, and integrilin for a duration of 18 hours, starting lipitor 80mg PO qday, continuing nitro drip for symptoms, and scheduling an ECG in the morning.

Other issues mentioned in the note include pump dysfunction, rhythm disturbances, diabetes management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Post-mi arrhythmias: The patient is at high risk for arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction. Close monitoring in the CCU is recommended.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently slightly low, there are no signs of decompensated heart"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - HgbA1c 11.2
   - LFT's remain elevated, marginally improved from prior
   - TTE read: EF20%, extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. Left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Focal hypokinesis
   of the apical free wall of the RV.
   - Holding BB for now
   - Plan for ACE tomorrow
   - [**Doctor Last Name 2736**] recommending heparin gtt bridge to coumadin given lv
   hypokinesis, [**Doctor Last Name **] prefers no heparin bridge due to concern for
   bleeding, so coumadin will begin tonight at 2.5mg
   - UOP low, given 10mg lasix since pt sounded crackly and also trying to
   bring pt down on the starling curve (the left ventricle looks huge) to
   increase contractility and improve forward flow.  UOP and BP good
   afterwards.
   - had persistent [**12-27**] pleuritic chest pain in the pm, pt clearly states
   this is different from her MI pain. EKG showed diffuse ST elevation,
   consistent with pericarditis and LV aneurysm. talked to attending Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6658**], who suggested IV 30mg toradol x1, and start colchicine.  Pain
   better after given above meds.
   - glargine 10u started qhs
   - had some back pain this AM, BPs stable in 90s. not like her anginal
   equivalent. likely MSK from lying on back as improved with palpation by
   RN/MD. improved with morphine, massage, and warm compresses.

   TTE [**12-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. A left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There
   are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Impression: extensive anterior, septal, apical infarction with possible
   apical clot
   CXR [**12-8**]: Normal lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly without obvious
   overhydration. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal
   Kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely to reflect
   interstitial fluid overload. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
   pneumonia. Normal appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar
   structures.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly, and also trying to bring pt down on the starling curve (the
   left ventricle looks huge) to increase contractility and improve
   forward flow.  UOP and BP good afterwards.
   - lasix prn to bring pt down on starling curve to enhance
   contractility, cardiac output and BP
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI when stable
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have extensive anterior, septal, and apical infarction with possible apical clot. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. STEMI: The patient had a myocardial infarction involving the left anterior descending artery, for which she received immediate treatment including thrombus removal and placement of a bare-metal stent. She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.

2. Post-MI pericarditis: The patient is at high risk for developing post-MI pericarditis, which is characterized by pleuritic chest pain. She has been experiencing positional chest pain and diffuse ST elevation on EKG, consistent with this condition. She was given toradol and started on colchicine.

3. PUMP dysfunction: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely depressed at 20%, indicating poor pumping function of the heart. This is due to extensive akinesis/dyskinesis in the apical region, anteroseptal akinesis, and hypokinesis in the anterior and inferior walls. There is also a possibility of a left ventricular apical mass/thrombus. To improve contractility and forward flow, she was given lasix.

4. Fluid overload: The"

   24 Hour Events:
   - HgbA1c 11.2
   - LFT's remain elevated, marginally improved from prior
   - TTE read: EF20%, extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. Left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Focal hypokinesis
   of the apical free wall of the RV.
   - Holding BB for now
   - Plan for ACE tomorrow
   - [**Doctor Last Name 2736**] recommending heparin gtt bridge to coumadin given lv
   hypokinesis, [**Doctor Last Name **] prefers no heparin bridge due to concern for
   bleeding, so coumadin will begin tonight at 2.5mg
   - UOP low, given 10mg lasix since pt sounded crackly and also trying to
   bring pt down on the starling curve (the left ventricle looks huge) to
   increase contractility and improve forward flow.  UOP and BP good
   afterwards.
   - had persistent [**12-27**] pleuritic chest pain in the pm, pt clearly states
   this is different from her MI pain. EKG showed diffuse ST elevation,
   consistent with pericarditis and LV aneurysm. talked to attending Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6658**], who suggested IV 30mg toradol x1, and start colchicine.  Pain
   better after given above meds.
   - glargine 10u started qhs

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly, and also trying to bring pt down on the starling curve (the
   left ventricle looks huge) to increase contractility and improve
   forward flow.  UOP and BP good afterwards.
   - lasix prn to bring pt down on starling curve to enhance
   contractility, cardiac output and BP
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI when stable
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI, but alk phos elevation is likely from biliary stasis
   from congestive heart failure given EF only 20%.  Unclear what the
   baseline is. Unknown hepB and hepC serologies.  Patient is not
   overweight, so fatty liver is less likely.
   - consider hepB and hepC serologies

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and had a STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a bare-metal stent in the LAD artery. Her ejection fraction (EF) is severely depressed at 20% on TTE, indicating extensive cardiac ischemia. She also has evidence of post-MI pericarditis, for which she was started on colchicine. She has crackles at the bases bilaterally and minimal kerley B lines on CXR, suggesting volume overload. Her BNP is elevated at 2464. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg PO qday, and she is holding her beta-blocker for now. She will need PT prior to discharge. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI: The patient has already experienced an extensive anterior, septal, apical infarction with possible apical clot. There is a risk of further cardiac ischemia or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Post-MI pericarditis: The patient is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis/dressler syndrome, as indicated by her pleuritic chest pain and EKG findings of diffuse ST elevation.
3. Heart failure: With an EF of 20%, the patient is at risk for congestive heart failure. Her crackles at the bases bilaterally"

   CXR [**12-8**]: Normal lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly without obvious
   overhydration. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal
   Kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely to reflect
   interstitial fluid overload. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
   pneumonia. Normal appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar
   structures.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly, and also trying to bring pt down on the starling curve (the
   left ventricle looks huge) to increase contractility and improve
   forward flow.  UOP and BP good afterwards.
   - lasix prn to bring pt down on starling curve to enhance
   contractility, cardiac output and BP
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI when stable
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI, but alk phos elevation is likely from biliary stasis
   from congestive heart failure given EF only 20%.  Unclear what the
   baseline is. Unknown hepB and hepC serologies.  Patient is not
   overweight, so fatty liver is less likely.
   - consider hepB and hepC serologies
   - continue to trend

","The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presents with chest pain and STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and had a thrombus removed and bare metal stent placed in the LAD. The ECG territory correlates with the findings on cardiac catheterization. The patient's risk factors include diabetes and smoking, but her lipid panel is unremarkable. Currently, her blood pressure is slightly low, but there is no evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.

The patient has been diagnosed with extensive anterior, septal, and apical infarction with possible apical clot. She also has post-MI pericarditis, as evidenced by pleuritic chest pain and diffuse ST elevation on EKG. The patient received toradol IV and was started on colchicine.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely depressed at 20% on TTE, and there is extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization, where a thrombus in the LAD artery was removed and a bare metal stent (BMS) was placed. She has extensive anterior, septal, and apical infarction with possible apical clot as per echocardiography. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely depressed at 20%. She also has post-MI pericarditis, evidenced by pleuritic chest pain and diffuse ST elevation on EKG. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged or recurrent chest pain due to pericarditis or ongoing myocardial ischemia.
2. Cardiogenic shock secondary to severe left ventricular dysfunction.
3. Development of heart failure due to the large dyskinetic left ventricle and fluid overload.
4. Increased risk of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Thromboembolic events like pulmonary embolism or stroke due to atrial fibrillation.
6. Further decline in left ventricular function leading to heart failure or need for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.
7. Poor glycemic control in the setting of diabetes.
8. Potential hepatic complications if liver function tests do not improve.

   Kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely to reflect
   interstitial fluid overload. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
   pneumonia. Normal appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar
   structures.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation to prevent mural thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily) when stable, possibly today or
   tomorrow
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI, but alk phos elevation is likely from biliary stasis
   from congestive heart failure given EF only 20%.  Unclear what the
   baseline is. Unknown hepB and hepC serologies.  Patient is not
   overweight, so fatty liver is less likely.
   - consider hepB and hepC serologies as outpatient
   - continue to trend LFT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presents with chest pain and a confirmed STEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, where a thrombus was removed from the LAD and a bare-metal stent (BMS) was placed. The ECG territory correlates with the findings on cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. STEMI: Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor 80mg PO qday. Hold beta-blocker for now due to the patient's low cardiac output.

2. Post-MI pericarditis: The patient is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis. She complains of pleuritic chest pain, and the EKG findings are consistent with post-MI pericarditis/dressler syndrome. The patient received toradol IV and was started on colchicine yesterday. Continue colchicine and morphine as needed.

3. PUMP: The patient has a severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% on TTE. There are crackles at the bases bilaterally, and the patient has a large dyskinetic LV on echo. The CXR showed minimal kerley B lines reflecting volume overload. The patient was given 10mg lasix since she sounded crackly, and the crackles resolved afterwards. Start ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily) when stable, possibly today or tomorrow. Consider repeating TTE in 3 months to reassess LV function. If EF persistently <30%, then the patient will need an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

4. RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia. This is likely a stress response with some compensation given the territory of infarction. However, the patient also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis. Hold beta-blocker but start metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable.

5. DM: The patient's HgA1c is 11.2. Hold oral agents and continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale. Refer to [**Last Name (un)**] for diabetic control as outpatient.

6. Elevated LFT: Transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos trending up. The elevated ALT, AST, and LDH are possibly leakage from the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress response to STEMI, but alk phos elevation is likely from biliary stasis from congestive heart failure given EF only 20%. Unclear what the baseline is. Unknown hepB and hepC serologies. Patient is not overweight, so fatty liver is less likely. Consider hepB and hepC serologies as outpatient and continue to trend LFT.

ICU care includes cardiac and diabetic diet, glycemic control with glargine and HISS, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she will continue to be monitored in the CCU."

   24 Hour Events:
   - HgbA1c 11.2
   - LFT's remain elevated, marginally improved from prior
   - TTE read: EF20%, extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. Left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Focal hypokinesis
   of the apical free wall of the RV.
   - Holding BB for now

   - [**Doctor Last Name 2736**] recommending heparin gtt bridge to coumadin given lv
   hypokinesis, [**Doctor Last Name **] prefers no heparin bridge due to concern for
   bleeding, so coumadin will begin tonight at 2.5mg
   - UOP low, given 10mg lasix since pt sounded crackly. Crackles improved
   dramatically. UOP and BP also good afterwards.
   - had persistent [**12-27**] pleuritic chest pain in the pm, pt clearly states
   this is different from her MI pain. EKG showed diffuse ST elevation,
   consistent with pericarditis and LV aneurysm. talked to attending Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6658**], who suggested IV 30mg toradol x1, and start colchicine.  Pain
   better after given above meds.
   - glargine 10u started qhs
   - had some back pain this AM, BPs stable in 90s. not like her anginal
   equivalent. likely MSK from lying on back as improved with palpation by

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation to prevent mural thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily) when stable, possibly today or
   tomorrow
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative disease,
   possibly congestive given EF only 20% or biliary injury (hepatic
   arteriopathy or drug reaction).  Unclear what the baseline is. Unknown
   hepB and hepC serologies.
   - continue to trend LFT
   - if continuous elevation of alk phos, consider medication effect

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had a thrombus removed from the left anterior descending artery, followed by the placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS). The ECG findings correlated with the results of the cardiac catheterization.

The patient's risk factors include diabetes and smoking, but her lipid panel is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is slightly low, but there is no evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The patient will continue taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and atorvastatin (Lipitor) orally once daily. Beta-blockers will be held for now due to the likely compensatory response to low cardiac output.

The patient is also at high risk for post-MI pericarditis, commonly known as Dressler syndrome. She has been experiencing pleuritic chest pain all day yesterday, and the positional nature of the pain along with diffuse ST elevation on the EKG are consistent with post-MI pericarditis. The patient received toradol (Ketorolac) IV and was started on colchicine. She will continue taking colchicine and receive morphine as needed for pain relief.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. 

She has been diagnosed with multiple conditions including post-MI pericarditis, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (PUMP), sinus tachycardia, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Her laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, abnormal liver function tests, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with blood pressure in the 80s and heart rate around 90 beats per minute. She is receiving various medications including aspirin, Plavix, lipitor, morphine, colchicine, heparin, and insulin. 

The patient's overall condition is being managed in the ICU, where she is receiving nutritional support and close monitoring of her vital signs, fluid balance, and blood glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. STEMI Complications: The patient has already experienced an extensive cardiac ischemia, which resulted in a STEMI. She underwent PCI with stent placement to restore blood flow to the affected area. However, she still has a reduced ejection fraction (20%) and a large dyskinetic left ventricle on echo, indicating potential complications such as heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation to prevent mural thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily) when stable, possibly today or
   tomorrow
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative disease,
   possibly congestive given EF only 20% or biliary injury (hepatic
   arteriopathy or drug reaction).  Unclear what the baseline is. Unknown
   hepB and hepC serologies.
   - continue to trend LFT
   - if continuous elevation of alk phos, consider medication effect

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia. She likely presented 2-3 days after the onset her MI. She is
   at maximal 30-day risk for mortality (36%) by her TIMI score. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable
   (this does not reflect the stability of her plaque, which is likely to
   be softer given her diabetes.) Currently BP is slightly low but no
   evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - patient started on 2.5 mg Lisinopril with increase of UOP thereafter
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient has been complaining of pleuritic
   chest pain constant since admission.  The positional nature of the
   pleuritic chest pain and EKG finding of diffuse ST elevation are
   consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain most improved with toradol
   IV 30mg x1, and was started on colchicine yesterday. Patient with
   fevers on [**12-11**], as infxs workup was unremarkable, most likely due to
   pericarditis
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - on ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily)
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Days sinus tachycardia and now in normal sinus. Wasmost
   likely a stress responses with some compensation given territory of
   infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest pain from
   pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on low dose metoprolol
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 20u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up (since admission).  The AST and LDH can possibly be from
   myocytes, but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially
   hepatocellular component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative
   disease, unlikely congestive given good function of right heart, or -
   more likely - biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).
   The two changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH
   and Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent
   standard labs (hepatidides, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]), those are pending.
   - continue to trend LFT

   Microbiology: Bcx pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia. She likely presented 2-3 days after the onset her MI. She is
   at maximal 30-day risk for mortality (36%) by her TIMI score. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable
   (this does not reflect the stability of her plaque, which is likely to
   be softer given her diabetes.) Currently BP is slightly low but no
   evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - patient started on 2.5 mg Lisinopril with increase of UOP thereafter
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient has been complaining of pleuritic
   chest pain constant since admission.  The positional nature of the
   pleuritic chest pain and EKG finding of diffuse ST elevation are
   consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain most improved with toradol
   IV 30mg x1, and was started on colchicine yesterday. Patient with
   fevers on [**12-11**], as infxs workup was unremarkable, most likely due to
   pericarditis
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - on ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily)
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Days sinus tachycardia and now in normal sinus. Wasmost
   likely a stress responses with some compensation given territory of
   infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest pain from
   pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on low dose metoprolol
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 20u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up (since admission).  The AST and LDH can possibly be from
   myocytes, but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially
   hepatocellular component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative
   disease, unlikely congestive given good function of right heart, or -
   more likely - biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).
   The two changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH
   and Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent
   standard labs (hepatidides, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]), those are pending.
   - continue to trend LFT

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known Lastname**] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presents with chest pain and STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The ECG territory correlates with the findings on cardiac catheterization. The patient likely presented 2-3 days after the onset of her MI, with significant q waves and prolonged chest pain. Her TIMI score indicates a 36% risk for mortality at 30 days. Risk factors include diabetes and smoking, but her lipid panel is unremarkable. Currently, her blood pressure is slightly low, but there is no evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.

Plan:
1. STEMI: Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor 80mg PO qday.
2. Post-MI pericarditis: Continue colchicine and morphine PRN.
3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Continue Coumadin 5 mg for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural thrombus. Hold beta-blocker for now given acute STEMI and low pressures. Start ACEI (Lisinopril 2.5mg daily). Repeat TTE in 3 months to reassess LV function. If EF persistently <30%, then pt will need an ICD.

   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - on ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily)
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Days sinus tachycardia and now in normal sinus. Wasmost
   likely a stress responses with some compensation given territory of
   infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest pain from
   pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on low dose metoprolol

   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 20u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up (since admission).  The AST and LDH can possibly be from
   myocytes, but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially
   hepatocellular component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative
   disease, unlikely congestive given good function of right heart, or -
   more likely - biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).
   The two changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH
   and Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent
   standard labs (hepatidides, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]), those are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with thrombus removal and placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS). The ECG territory correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization, indicating significant q waves and prolonged chest pain, suggesting extensive cardiac ischemia.

The patient's risk factors include diabetes and smoking, but her lipid panel is unremarkable. Currently, her blood pressure is slightly low, but there is no evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. She is being continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor 80mg PO qday.

The patient also has post-MI pericarditis, evidenced by pleuritic chest pain and diffuse ST elevation on EKG. She has been started on colchicine, and morphine is given as needed for pain relief.

Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 20% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), showing a large dyskinetic left ventricle. There are crackles at the bases bilaterally on lung exam, and minimal Kerley B lines are seen on chest X-ray, likely reflecting volume overload. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated at 2464.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI c/b post-STEMI pericarditis.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed 2-3 days after the onset
   of her MI.  Given significant q waves and prolonged time of chest pain,
   likely extensive cardiac ischemia. She is at maximal 30-day risk for
   mortality (36%) by her TIMI score (DM, smoking). Currently BP is
   slightly low but no evidence of decompensated heart failure or
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - holding Beta-blocker given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - PT evaluation
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient had pleuritic chest pain since
   admission consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain improved with
   several doses of Toradol and Colchicine. Patient with fevers on [**12-11**],
   infectious w/u demonstrates UTI, but concomitant fever from
   pericarditis may be possible.
   - Continue Colchicine & Morphine PRN:pain
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE with large dyskinetic LV on echo.  Initially,
   patient with volume overload by CXR and clinical exam, but without
   edema, crackles or S3 this a AM after low dose Lasix.
   - Continue Coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - Holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   .
   4. UTI: Patient with fevers on [**12-11**] & mildly positive U/A. Blood &
   urine cultures pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin day [**12-20**]
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Currently in normal sinus rhythm with hr
s in the 80-90
   Prior tachycardia was likely a stress response with some compensation
   given territory of infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest
   pain from pericarditis.
   - Will start low dose Metoprolol when blood pressures tolerate
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs, but extent
   of disease warrants [**Last Name (un) 303**] referral as outpatient.
   - Continue Glargine 30u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   6. Elevated LFT
s:  Resolving. Patient with initial transaminitis, but
    ALT/AST have normalized and alkaline phosphatase, LDH, GGT are
   trending down.  Given pattern of LFT elevation, this was most c/w a
   hepatic process, likely a resolving biliary insult (hepatic
   arteriopathy or drug reaction).  RUQ u/s is unremarkable.  Hepatitis
   serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], AMA all negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia. She likely presented 2-3 days after the onset her MI. She is
   at maximal 30-day risk for mortality (36%) by her TIMI score. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable
   (this does not reflect the stability of her plaque, which is likely to
   be softer given her diabetes.) Currently BP is slightly low but no
   evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - patient started on 2.5 mg Lisinopril with increase of UOP thereafter
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient has been complaining of pleuritic
   chest pain constant since admission.  The positional nature of the
   pleuritic chest pain and EKG finding of diffuse ST elevation are
   consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain most improved with toradol
   IV 30mg x1, and was started on colchicine yesterday. Patient with
   fevers on [**12-11**], as infxs workup was unremarkable, most likely due to
   pericarditis
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - on ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily)
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Days sinus tachycardia and now in normal sinus. Wasmost
   likely a stress responses with some compensation given territory of
   infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest pain from
   pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on low dose metoprolol
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 20u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up (since admission).  The AST and LDH can possibly be from
   myocytes, but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially
   hepatocellular component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative
   disease, unlikely congestive given good function of right heart, or -
   more likely - biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).
   The two changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH
   and Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent
   standard labs (hepatidides, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]), those are pending.
   - continue to trend LFT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and STEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and had a stent placed in the LAD artery. The patient's ECG territory correlates with the findings on cardiac catheterization, indicating extensive cardiac ischemia. She likely presented 2-3 days after the onset of her MI, and her TIMI score indicates a maximal 30-day risk for mortality.

The patient has multiple medical complications:

1. STEMI: The patient had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent placement.
2. Post-MI pericarditis: The patient complains of pleuritic chest pain, and the EKG findings of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI pericarditis. She has been started on colchicine and given toradol for pain relief.
3. PUMP: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), indicating reduced left ventricular function. She also has diffuse crackles on lung exam and evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray. Her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 2464, suggesting heart failure. She has been given lasix to manage fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI c/b post-STEMI pericarditis.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed 2-3 days after the onset
   of her MI.  Given significant q waves and prolonged time of chest pain,
   likely extensive cardiac ischemia. She is at maximal 30-day risk for
   mortality (36%) by her TIMI score (DM, smoking). Currently BP is
   slightly low but no evidence of decompensated heart failure or
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - holding Beta-blocker given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - PT evaluation
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient had pleuritic chest pain since
   admission consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain improved with
   several doses of Toradol and Colchicine. Patient with fevers on [**12-11**],
   infectious w/u demonstrates UTI, but concomitant fever from
   pericarditis may be possible.
   - Continue Colchicine & Morphine PRN:pain
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE with large dyskinetic LV on echo.  Initially,
   patient with volume overload by CXR and clinical exam, but without
   edema, crackles or S3 this a AM after low dose Lasix.
   - Continue Coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - Holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Currently in normal sinus rhythm with hr
s in the 80-90
   Prior tachycardia was likely a stress response with some compensation
   given territory of infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest
   pain from pericarditis.
   - Will start low dose Metoprolol when blood pressures tolerate
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs, but extent
   of disease warrants [**Last Name (un) 303**] referral as outpatient.
   - Continue Glargine 30u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  Transaminitis trending down, but alkaline phosphatase
   & GGT remain elevated.  The AST and LDH can possibly be from myocytes,
   but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially hepatocellular
   component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative disease, unlikely
   congestive given good function of right heart, or - more likely -
   biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).  The two
   changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH and
   Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent
   standard labs (hepatidides, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **]), those are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia. She likely presented 2-3 days after the onset her MI. She is
   at maximal 30-day risk for mortality (36%) by her TIMI score. Her risk
   factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel is unremarkable
   (this does not reflect the stability of her plaque, which is likely to
   be softer given her diabetes.) Currently BP is slightly low but no
   evidence of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - patient started on 2.5 mg Lisinopril with increase of UOP thereafter
   - hold b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient has been complaining of pleuritic
   chest pain constant since admission.  The positional nature of the
   pleuritic chest pain and EKG finding of diffuse ST elevation are
   consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain most improved with toradol
   IV 30mg x1, and was started on colchicine yesterday. Patient with
   fevers on [**12-11**], as infxs workup was unremarkable, most likely due to
   pericarditis
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**12-8**] since pt sounded
   crackly.  Crackles resolved afterwards.
   - continue coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - on ACEI (lisinopril 2.5mg daily)
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Days sinus tachycardia and now in normal sinus. Wasmost
   likely a stress responses with some compensation given territory of
   infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest pain from
   pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on low dose metoprolol
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 20u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up (since admission).  The AST and LDH can possibly be from
   myocytes, but the equal elevation of ALT implies a partially
   hepatocellular component. Alk phos elevation reflects infiltrative
   disease, unlikely congestive given good function of right heart, or -
   more likely - biliary injury (hepatic arteriopathy or drug reaction).
   The two changes can be seperated where AST/ALT could be related to NASH
   and Alkphos related to biliary injury. RUQ u/s is unremarkable. We sent

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with chest pain and STEMI.
- She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was found to have extensive cardiac ischemia.
- The patient is at maximal 30-day risk for mortality due to her TIMI score.
- She has risk factors including diabetes and smoking but has an unremarkable lipid panel.
- Her blood pressure is slightly low, but there are no signs of decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
- The patient is on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor for cardiac management.
- She is also on Lisinopril for blood pressure control and to prevent/treat mural thrombus.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI c/b post-STEMI pericarditis.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed 2-3 days after the onset
   of her MI.  Given significant q waves and prolonged time of chest pain,
   likely extensive cardiac ischemia. She is at maximal 30-day risk for
   mortality (36%) by her TIMI score (DM, smoking). Currently BP is
   slightly low but no evidence of decompensated heart failure or
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Start low dose Toprol 12.5mg daily
   - PT evaluation
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: Patient had pleuritic chest pain since
   admission consistent with post-MI pericarditis. Pain improved with
   several doses of Toradol and Colchicine. Patient with fevers on [**12-11**],
   infectious w/u demonstrates UTI, but concomitant fever from
   pericarditis may be possible.
   - Continue Colchicine & Morphine PRN:pain
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE with large dyskinetic LV on echo.  Initially,
   patient with volume overload by CXR and clinical exam, but without
   edema, crackles or S3 this a AM after low dose Lasix.
   - Continue Coumadin 5 mg  for anticoagulation to prevent/treat mural
   thrombus
   - Holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI and low pressures
   - Continue Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   .
   4. UTI: Patient with fevers on [**12-11**] & mildly positive U/A. Blood &
   urine cultures pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin PO, day [**12-20**]
   .
   4. RHYTHM: Currently in normal sinus rhythm with hr
s in the 80-90
   Prior tachycardia was likely a stress response with some compensation
   given territory of infarction.  However, she also has pleuritic chest
   pain from pericarditis.
   - Will start low dose Metoprolol when blood pressures tolerate
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2. Uptitrating insulin to fit patient needs, but extent
   of disease warrants [**Last Name (un) 303**] referral as outpatient.
   - Continue Glargine 30u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   6. Elevated LFT
s:  Resolving. Patient with initial transaminitis, but
   ALT/AST have normalized and alkaline phosphatase, LDH, GGT are trending
   down.  Given pattern of LFT elevation, this was most c/w a hepatic
   process, likely a resolving biliary insult (hepatic arteriopathy or
   drug reaction).  RUQ u/s is unremarkable.  Hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **],
   AMA all negative.
   - continue to trend LFT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. STEMI: The patient has evidence of an extensive cardiac ischemia, likely due to a thrombus in the LAD artery. She is at high risk for mortality at 30 days (36%).
2. Post-MI pericarditis: The patient experienced pleuritic chest pain since admission, which improved with Toradol and Colchicine. There is a possibility of concomitant fever from pericarditis.
3. Pump dysfunction: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and large dyskinetic left ventricle on echocardiogram. Initially, she had volume overload but was managed with low-dose Lasix.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had fevers on [**12-11**] and mildly positive urinalysis. Blood and urine cultures are pending.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's HbA1c is 11.2, indicating poor glycemic control. Insulin therapy is being uptitrated to manage her diabetes.
6. Elevated liver function tests"
