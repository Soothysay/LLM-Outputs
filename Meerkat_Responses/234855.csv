   This is a 55 year old female with DMI and multiple admissions for DKA,
   gastroparesis, HTN, who presents with DKA.
   .
   #  DKA:  Pt has had many admissions in the past few years for DKA.  On
   this admission there was no e/o inciting cause for DKA, however, this
   AM BCx were with GPC clusters x3. Pt
s gap closed, lytes and glucose
   are improving after transitioning from insulin gtt to 14 long acting
   insulin [**Hospital1 **] with ISS.
   - q4 lytes, monitor AG, aggressively replete lytes as needed
   - transition to home 28 Lantus [**Hospital1 **] with ISS
   .
   # Bacteremia: GPC clusters x3, started on vanc.
   - will pull a-line once get IV access (pt says she normally needs a
   PIC)
   .
   #  HTN:  Hypertensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. Overnight continued to
   have SBPs in 190s, responded well to captopril 6.25 po, since has been
   SBP 160s
   - cont home losartan po 75 daily
   - can consider diltiazem po if need more rate control (will avoid beta
   blockers due to hyperglycemia)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), gastroparesis, hypertension, and depression. The patient presents with DKA and has had several previous admissions for the same condition. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 bpm, fluctuating blood pressure ranging from 153/84 mmHg to 142/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, low magnesium, and low phosphorus. 

The patient's abdominal pain is mentioned as well, with diffuse mild tenderness to palpation. 

Assessment and plan include the following: 
- DKA: The patient's DKA has improved after transitioning from insulin gtt to long-acting insulin. Close monitoring of acid-base gap, electrolytes, and glucose levels is recommended. 
- Bacteremia: The patient has GPC clusters x3 and has started on vancomycin. 
- Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure was initially uncontrolled but responded well to captopril. Losartan is recommended for home management, and diltiazem may be considered if further rate control is needed. 
- [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease: The patient has consistent sick euthyroid syndrome with suppressed TSH and abnormal thyroid function tests. Methimazole is continued. 
- GERD: Protonix is continued for the patient's GERD. 
- Depression: Amitriptyline is continued for the patient's depression. 
- FEN: The patient is receiving IV fluids, electrolyte repletion, and NPO status. 
- Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, and outpatient PPI are recommended. 
- Access: The patient has a right femoral TLC line. 
- Code: Presumed full code status is indicated. 
- Communication: Patient communication is mentioned. 
- Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending above. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of DKA, bacteremia/sepsis, uncontrolled hypertension, and complications related to the patient's other comorbidities such as thyroid disease, GERD, depression, and FEN."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), gastroparesis, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis.
- The patient presented with DKA, and her blood glucose levels were in the 100-120s range in the early afternoon yesterday. She received insulin at 1630 and 8 hours later for a blood sugar level of 279, which has now improved to 136 this morning.
- The patient also has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci clusters, for which she was started on vancomycin. There is a possibility of an abscess or osteomyelitis.
- The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on captopril, so her home medication of losartan will be increased. Rate control measures will also be implemented.
- The patient has diffuse polyarthralgias, which are likely due to rheumatoid arthritis. If the symptoms worsen or become more focal, a septic arthritis workup will be considered.
- The patient's thyroid function tests show sick euthyroid syndrome.
- Other medical conditions include GERD, depression, and Hashimoto's disease, for which she is already receiving appropriate medications.
- The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, insulin, and antibiotics, and her electrolytes are being closely monitored.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   This is a 55 year old female with DMI and multiple admissions for DKA,
   gastroparesis, HTN, who presents with DKA, found to have GPC
   bacteremia.
   .
   #Sepsis: Patient has been having tachycardia and low SBP (80-90s), flat
   JVP, CVP=6. Sepsis likely due to GPC bacteremia. Responsive to 500 cc
   NS boluses. Unsure if septic vs. hypovolemic shock or mixed etiology.
   -Check venous O2 before give the patient fluids.
   -After checking venous O2, give the patient fluids and see if responds.
   -Follow CVP, UOP.
   # Bacteremia: GPC clusters x3, started on vanc. Also with questionable
   baseline belly/back pain vs abscess vs osteo.
   - if endocarditis w/u neg, can consider abd CT/MRI for other etiologies
   mentioned above. Hypotension likely related to bacteremia.
   - Continue NS boluses as needed.
   - f/u culture sensitivities
   - Continue Vanco (Day 2)
   - Need to check vanco trough.
   - Will get TEE today, so currently NPO  on D5W.
   .
   #  DKA:  Pt has had many admissions in the past few years for DKA.  On
   this admission there was no e/o inciting cause for DKA initially,
   however, BCx were with GPC clusters x3. Patient
s gap closed. Increased
   fingersticks,. Currently taking PO food.
   - Initiate home insulin regimen of 28 Lantus [**Hospital1 **].
   - check glucose QID.
   .
   #  HTN:  Hypertensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], but curently hypotensive
   likely due to GPC bacteremia. Will hold home BP meds.
   - Hold Losartan
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: diffuse polyarthralgias today, probable
   baseline RA. If worsens or becomes more focal can consider septic
   arthritis w/u.
   - cont home sulfasalazine
   .
   #  [**Doctor Last Name 598**] disease:  On last admission TSH suppressed, but TFTs
   consistent with sick euthyroid.
   - cont methimazole

   Disposition: Patient can have TEE on floors and then be called out.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), gastroparesis, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient presents with DKA, found to have gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia, abdominal pain, and low blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and low systolic blood pressure indicate potential sepsis due to GPC bacteremia. The patient's response to 500 cc normal saline (NS) boluses suggests that septic shock may be present.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of GPC bacteremia raises the concern for endocarditis, especially considering the patient's history of DKA and multiple admissions. Further investigation is needed to rule out this possibility.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. Proper management of the patient's diabetes and blood glucose levels is crucial.
4. Hypertension: The patient's initial presentation with hypertension may be related to her underlying medical condition. However, the current hypotensive state is likely due to GPC bacteremia.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's diffuse polyarthralgias could be related to her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presents with DKA, and it was found that she had gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient has had multiple admissions in the past few years for DKA. Her blood cultures showed GPC clusters x3, and she was started on vancomycin. The patient's hypotension is likely related to bacteremia. She is currently receiving NS boluses as needed and will continue with vancomycin. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with losartan. However, she is currently hypotensive and may require adjustments in her medication regimen. She also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, and she is currently experiencing diffuse polyarthralgias. If her symptoms worsen or become more focal, a septic arthritis workup may be considered. The patient is also diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and is currently on methimazole. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and depression. She is currently receiving proton pump inhibitors and antidepressants, respectively. In the ICU, the patient's nutrition is being managed with a full diet, and her glycemic control is being monitored through fingerstick glucose measurements. She is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and an unknown allergy to penicillins. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to bacteremia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/62 mmHg to 127/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and dextrose 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, which indicates an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not managed properly.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and acidosis. It requires prompt medical attention to correct electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with readings ranging from 99/62 mmHg to 127/88 mmHg. This may indicate potential hypotension, which could be caused by sepsis, volume depletion, or medication side effects."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   This is a 55 year old female with DMI and multiple admissions for DKA,
   gastroparesis, HTN, who presents with DKA, found to have GPC
   bacteremia.
   .
   #Sepsis: Patient has been having tachycardia and low SBP (80-90s), flat
   JVP, CVP=6. Sepsis likely due to GPC bacteremia. Responsive to 500 cc
   NS boluses. Initially, unsure if septic vs. hypovolemic shock or mixed
   etiology. SvO2 66%, given IVF, responded well. Will continue to give
   gentle IV bolus as needed
   -Follow CVP, UOP.
   # Bacteremia: GPC coag negative clusters x3, started on vanc. Also with
   questionable baseline belly/back pain vs abscess vs osteo. TTE/TEE
   showed no e/o endocarditis.
   - consider abd CT/MRI for other etiologies mentioned above if worsens.
   Hypotension likely related to bacteremia.
   - Continue NS boluses as needed.
   - f/u culture sensitivities for coag neg staph
   - Continue Vanco (Day 2)
   - Need to check vanco trough.
   - Will get TEE today, so currently NPO  on D5W.
   .
   #  DKA:  Pt has had many admissions in the past few years for DKA.  On
   this admission there was no e/o inciting cause for DKA initially,
   however, BCx were with GPC clusters x3. Patient
s gap closed. Increased
   fingersticks,. Currently taking PO food. FSBGs well controlled, with
   except at night they occ increase to 200s, and they are low in the 60s
   in the AM. Pt currently on fixed dose 21 Lantus [**Hospital1 **], and ISS.
   - will review and trend FSBG today as patient PO intake improves and
   titrate fixed dose vs ISS.
   - check glucose QID.
   .
   # Pain control: probably secondary to RA and diabetic neuropathy
   - increased home nuerontin to 900 tid
   - fentanyl patch
   .
   #  HTN:  Hypertensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], but curently hypotensive
   likely due to GPC bacteremia. Will hold home BP meds.
   - Hold Losartan
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: diffuse polyarthralgias today, probable
   baseline RA. If worsens or becomes more focal can consider septic
   arthritis w/u.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DMI), a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension (HTN), gastroparesis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and depression. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia, suspected sepsis, and DKA.

The patient's medical history includes multiple admissions for DKA and gastroparesis. She presents with symptoms of DKA, which was confirmed upon admission. She also has GPC bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient's abdominal pain may be related to an abscess, osteomyelitis, or another underlying cause. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed to rule out endocarditis, but no vegetations were found.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure in the 80-90s, flat jugular venous pressure (JVP), and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6. These findings suggest possible sepsis, which is responsive to intravenous fluid boluses. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 66%, indicating poor tissue perfusion.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), and normal creatinine (Cr) levels. Her blood glucose levels are elevated, consistent with DKA. Other lab values such as calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal range. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is suppressed, but free T4 (fT4) levels are within normal range, suggesting a non-thyroidal illness syndrome.

The patient's pain is managed with increased neurontin and fentanyl patch. Her hypertension medication is held due to hypotension likely related to bacteremia. The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medication and antidepressant are continued.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for septic shock due to GPC bacteremia and suspected sepsis. There is also a possibility of developing further complications related to DKA, such as cerebral edema or acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers due to prolonged ICU stay. Monitoring for these complications and providing appropriate treatment is essential for the patient's well-being."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   This is a 55 year old female with DMI and multiple admissions for DKA,
   gastroparesis, HTN, who presents with DKA, found to have GPC
   bacteremia.
   .
   #Sepsis: Patient has been having tachycardia and low SBP (80-90s), flat
   JVP, CVP=6. Sepsis likely due to GPC bacteremia. Responsive to 500 cc
   NS boluses. Unsure if septic vs. hypovolemic shock or mixed etiology.
   SvO2 66%, given IVF, responded well.
   -Follow CVP, UOP.
   # Bacteremia: GPC clusters x3, started on vanc. Also with questionable
   baseline belly/back pain vs abscess vs osteo.
   - if endocarditis w/u neg, can consider abd CT/MRI for other etiologies
   mentioned above. Hypotension likely related to bacteremia.
   - Continue NS boluses as needed.
   - f/u culture sensitivities
   - Continue Vanco (Day 2)
   - Need to check vanco trough.
   - Will get TEE today, so currently NPO  on D5W.
   .
   #  DKA:  Pt has had many admissions in the past few years for DKA.  On
   this admission there was no e/o inciting cause for DKA initially,
   however, BCx were with GPC clusters x3. Patient
s gap closed. Increased
   fingersticks,. Currently taking PO food. FSBGs well controlled, except
   at night they occ increase to 200s
   - Increase from 21 Lantus [**Hospital1 **] to home 28 Lantus [**Hospital1 **].
   - check glucose QID.
   .
   #  HTN:  Hypertensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], but curently hypotensive
   likely due to GPC bacteremia. Will hold home BP meds.
   - Hold Losartan
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: diffuse polyarthralgias today, probable
   baseline RA. If worsens or becomes more focal can consider septic
   arthritis w/u.
   - cont home sulfasalazine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and sepsis. The patient was found to have significant bacteremia with gram-positive cocci, but the source has not been clearly defined. The patient has shown substantial improvement with empirical antibiotic treatment and resolution of significant acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA:
   - Continue with oral intake
   - Continue with subcutaneous insulin dosing

2. Sepsis and Bacteremia:
   - Vancomycin to continue for coag-negative staph
   - Blood pressure continues with low normal readings
   - Gram-positive cocci without clear source identified but clinical scenario suggests clearing
   - Will need to continue to monitor blood pressure as it has been slow to respond

3. Joint Pain:
   - Will continue to dose pain medications on an as-needed basis

Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of this date.
The patient also has a history of hypertension, benign abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness), anemia, and is currently receiving ICU care. Nutrition is being provided through a po diet, and glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
