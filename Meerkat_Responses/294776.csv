","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis, presenting post ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. The patient experienced bleeding from the sphincterotomy, which was locally controlled, and was admitted for further observation due to the risk of re-bleed. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and afebrile, with no evidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and a vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels, but these are trending down. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and the use of certain medications has been adjusted due to the risk of bleeding. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to continue antibiotics, monitor hemodynamic status, and recheck hematocrit levels after a blood transfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Given the patient's recent bleeding episode, there is a potential risk of re-bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: Cholangitis is an infection of the bile ducts, and if not appropriately managed, there is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
3. Liver Dysfunction:"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who presented post ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. The patient experienced bleeding from the sphincterotomy, which was locally controlled during ERCP. However, the patient is at high risk of rebleeding. She also had an episode of large maroon bowel movement and her systolic blood pressure was in the 90-100 range. The patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Her hemoglobin (Hct) level decreased from 32.2% to 26.7% over the course of 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure ranging from 110-140 mmHg and heart rate ranging from 60-74 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits at 15-24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.9-37.0 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and her cardiovascular and respiratory systems are normal. However, her peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities. Abdominally, she has soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and her extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 16.1 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 26.7%, and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 163 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range at 122 mg/dL, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down. Other labs including creatinine (Cr), electrolytes, and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for cholangitis, monitoring her heart rate and blood pressure, obtaining cultures if indicated, and assessing for any signs of bleeding. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in her condition and will be considered for discharge to the floor if she remains hemodynamically stable and shows no active signs of bleeding."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who presented post ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. She experienced sphincterotomy bleeding that was locally controlled and admitted to the ICU for further observation due to the risk of re-bleed. The patient had continued episodes of bloody stools and was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to progressively decreasing hematocrit (Hct). Her Hct is currently at 30.8. She is hemodynamically stable and her pressures have been elevated. 

The plan includes following up with ERCP regarding taking the patient back to the operating room for resolution of the bleeding site. The patient's Hct will be trended every 6 hours, and she will be transfused for an Hct of less than 25. An active type and screen will be maintained, and the patient will be allowed sips per ERCP. Hemodynamic monitoring will continue, along with the use of two large bore IVs. Sc heparin will be held due to the risk of bleed, and IV pantoprazole (protonix) will be given. 

Additionally, the patient has cholangitis, stones in the common bile duct, and biliary ductal dilation. She has been afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, but total bilirubin has increased to 4.5."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who presented post ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. She had bleeding from the sphincterotomy, which was locally controlled but required admission to the ICU for further observation due to the risk of re-bleeding. 

The patient continues to have episodes of bloody stools, and her hemoglobin levels have been progressively decreasing. She has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her hematocrit (Hct) level is currently 30.8%. 

During the ERCP procedure, clots were found in the stent, and it had migrated into the duodenum. The patient also received cautery and epinephrine to stop additional bleeding. Her post-ERCP Hct dropped to 21.1. 

The patient's blood pressure has been stable in the range of 90-110 mmHg post-procedure. 

The plan includes transfusing 2 units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP, monitoring Hct every 6 hours and transfusing for Hct < 25, maintaining an active type and screen, keeping the patient NPO, and closely monitoring hemodynamics. 

The patient also has cholangitis, stones in the common bile duct, for which she underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. A"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 87 yoF w/ cholangitis presenting post ERCP-
   sphincterotomy and stent placement with sphincterotomy bleeding which
   was locally controlled- admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further observation given
   risk of re-bleed.
   Plan:
    # GI BLEED: s/p ERCP and sphincterotomy.  The patient had continued
   episodes of [**Last Name (un) 1165**]/bloody stools.  Pt was transfused 2U pRBC due to
   progressively decreasing Hct. Today Hct is 25.5 down from 26.7 last
   night. The patient went to ERCP and was found to have clots and her
   stent had migrated into the duodenum.  She also had cautery and epi to
   stop additional bleeding.  Hemodynamically the patient has been
   stable.  Likely continued bleeding from ERCP site.  Pt with
   thrombocytopenia this AM of 82.  Pt has not been on heparin due to GI
   bleed, but did recieve SQ heparin on admission.  INR and PTT wnl.
   Cipro and flagyl not associated with thrombocytopenia.
   - check HIT panel, check smear
   - Hem/ Onc to eval
   - f/u ERCP recs
   -trend hct q6hrs, transfuse for hct of < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   - NPO
   - hemodynamic monitoring.
   -2 large bore IVs
   -given risk of bleed will hold sc heparin
   - IV PPI

   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP with a sphincterotomy and stent placment for
   cholangitis, stones in the common bile duct.  Pt returned to ERCP and
   the stent had migrated and addition stone was found.  Pt had new stent
   placed and the old one was recovered.  LFT and Amylase are elevated
   today. TBili has minimally decreased to 4.2. Pt at risk for post-ERCP
   pancreatitis.
   -continue antibiotics cipro / flagyl
   - remain NPO
   -goal UOP > 30cc/hr
   -monitor HR and BP
   -check daily LFT and pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with ERCP recs
   .
   # Transaminase elevation: likely [**2-26**] cholangitis.  LFT and Bilirubins
   are trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - will trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: See above. HIT vs ITP vs Medications vs MDS
   - check HIT panel and smear
   - Hem/Onc consult
   -check CBC q6
   .
   # HTN: Pt was  hypertensive and given 10mg labetolol x 1 yesterday and
   this AM, pt asymptomatic.   Home med is atenolol, but will use

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 87 yoF w/ cholangitis presenting post ERCP-
   sphincterotomy and stent placement with sphincterotomy bleeding which
   was locally controlled- admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further observation given
   risk of re-bleed.
   Plan:
    # GI BLEED: s/p ERCP and sphincterotomy.  The patient had continued
   episodes of [**Last Name (un) 1165**]/bloody stools.  Pt was transfused 2U pRBC due to
   progressively decreasing Hct. Today Hct is 25.5 down from 26.7 last
   night. The patient went to ERCP and was found to have clots and her
   stent had migrated into the duodenum.  She also had cautery and epi to
   stop additional bleeding.  Hemodynamically the patient has been
   stable.  Likely continued bleeding from ERCP site. Pt platelets
   decreased likely [**2-26**] to transfusions.  INR and PTT wnl.  Cipro and
   flagyl not associated with thrombocytopenia, however pt given Vanco
   that could be myelosupressive.  ERCP plans to take her back to the OR
   today.
   - will transfuse 1U pRBC per ERCP
   - f/u ERCP recs
   -trend hct q6hrs, transfuse for hct of < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   - NPO
   - hemodynamic monitoring.
   -2 large bore IVs
   -given risk of bleed will hold sc heparin
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP with a sphincterotomy and stent placment for
   cholangitis, stones in the common bile duct.  Pt returned to ERCP and
   the stent had migrated and addition stone was found.  Pt had new stent
   placed and the old one was recovered.  Pt was hypotensive and
   hypothermic.  Pt started on Vanco post procedure.  LFT and Amylase are
   elevated today. TBili has minimally decreased to 4.2. Pt at risk for
   post-ERCP pancreatitis.
   -continue antibiotics cipro / flagyl
   - will switch vanco to amp
   - remain NPO
   -goal UOP > 30cc/hr
   -monitor HR and BP
   -check daily LFT and pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with ERCP recs
   .
   # Transaminase elevation: likely [**2-26**] cholangitis.  LFT and Bilirubins
   are trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - will trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: See above.  Likely [**2-26**] multiple transfusions.
   Unlikely HIT given not thrombotic and hasn
t received heparin.
   Possible contribution from vanco.
   -check CBC q6
   .
   # HTN: Pt was  hypertensive and given 10mg labetolol x 1 yesterday and
   this AM, pt asymptomatic.   Home med is atenolol, but will use
   lopressor for shorting acting [**Doctor Last Name 23**] given risk of bleed.
   -Will start captopril since short acting ACE and normal renal fxn.
   - lopressor 12.5mg TID
   .
   # CAD: no active issues.  Hold ASA and lipitor.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and had a clot removed, with a stent placed. However, the stent migrated into the duodenum, and the patient experienced bleeding from the ERCP site. The patient received a blood transfusion and was started on vancomycin.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of bloody stools and decreasing hemoglobin levels. The patient's platelet count has also decreased, likely due to multiple transfusions. The patient's INR and PTT are within normal limits, but there is a concern for continued bleeding from the ERCP site. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are normal.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, b12 deficiency, hyperlipidemia, and liver disease. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding from the ERCP site, and there is a concern for continued bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and blood products should be done.

2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for cholangitis and has been started on vancomycin. Regular monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count, and infection parameters should be done to assess for any"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who underwent ERCP sphincterotomy and stent placement. The patient has experienced bleeding after the procedure, which was locally controlled but required cautery twice. She has also had episodes of melanotic stool, likely representing previous bleeding moving through the bowel rather than current bleeding. The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to progressively decreasing hematocrit levels. Hemodynamically, the patient has been stable, but there is likely continued bleeding from the ERCP site.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 199/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, thin appearance, PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, and symmetric chest expansion with crackles bibasilarly.

Laboratory results show a leukocyte count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 132 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 192 mg/dL, and liver function tests indicating transaminase elevation. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has negative hepatitis serology.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who presented for ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. She had bleeding from the sphincterotomy site, which was locally controlled but required repeated cautery. The patient has had episodes of melanotic stool, indicating ongoing bleeding. She was transfused 1U pRBC due to progressively decreasing Hct. Her hemodynamic status is stable, but she is refusing all medications, labs, and procedures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding from the ERCP site, as evidenced by the episodes of melanotic stool. This can lead to further blood loss and potential hypotension.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis due to stones in the common bile duct. This condition requires ongoing antibiotic therapy to prevent infection and complications such as sepsis.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated amylase levels, indicating a risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis. Monitoring pancreatic enzymes and LFTs is essential to detect any worsening of this condition.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low due to multiple transfusions and consumption from bleeding. Monitoring CBC q6 is important to track the platelet count and consider additional interventions if necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications like stroke or cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who underwent an ERCP procedure and developed post-ERCP bleeding. The bleeding was initially controlled using electrocautery, but the patient continues to have episodes of melanotic stool, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, and she received a blood transfusion. She is currently refusing all medications, labs, and procedures. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is hemodynamically stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding from the ERCP site, which may require further intervention such as IR embolization if she continues to bleed and requires transfusions.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, for which she underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement. She is at risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, and her liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes should be monitored daily.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count due to multiple transfusions and consumption from bleeding. This may need to be managed with platelet transfusions if necessary.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, but she is currently refusing blood pressure medications. Her blood pressure should be monitored, and alternative antihypertensive options may need to be considered.
5. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of cholangitis who presented after undergoing an ERCP-sphincterotomy and stent placement. She experienced bleeding from the sphincterotomy site, which was locally controlled but required admission to the ICU for further observation due to the risk of re-bleeding. The patient has been refusing all medications, labs, and procedures but allowed labs to be drawn this morning. Her current condition is stable with no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits except for hypertension. She has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with valsartan. The patient's recent blood work shows elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, indicating improvement from previous values.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old female with cholangitis who underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement.
- The patient experienced bleeding after the procedure, which was locally controlled but required admission to the ICU for further observation.
- The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high, ranging from 190s to 140s, despite medication changes.
- The patient's white blood cell count has fluctuated slightly over the past few days.
- The patient's hematocrit level improved from 26.7 to 36.2.
- The patient's liver function tests are elevated, likely due to cholangitis.
- The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to multiple transfusions and bleeding.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and congestive heart failure.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being called out for potential discharge to a skilled nursing facility.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics for cholangitis, antihypertensives, and medications for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's consistently high blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.
2. Bleeding: Although the bleeding has stopped, the patient's low platelet count and recent"
