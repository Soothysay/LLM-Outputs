   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient meets sirs criteria with fever,
   tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
   Infectious source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, must also
   consider pulmonary source w/ new O2 requirement although more likely
   from capillary leak/CHF. Patient has remained fluid responsive and has
   not required pressors. Lactate responded with initial fluid to 1.7,
   Sv02 78. Random cortisol 34.3.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - no pressors currently as still requires ivf clinically
   - check serial lactates
   - given concern for gallstone pancreatitis, definitive management with
   ERCP planned today
   - f/u final OSH CT read, outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Definitive ERCP planned for today. NPO, IVF,
   monitor iCa, vanco/zosyn/gent as above.
   - f/u OSH imaging
   - NPO
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal aware pt here
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD in am
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: suspect capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs. CHF as
   pt with known CAD, but underlying infection as CXR without infiltrate,
   no sputum or cough, but also possible.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - trend CE's
   - continue aspirin/plavix, resume post ERCP
   - hold statin with hepatitis
   - if oxygen requirement worsens, consider ECHO to evaluate EF (no ECHO
   in our system)
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - CPAP overnight if not intubated post ERCP
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Unclear baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] be low
   related to ESRD (not on epo as outpatient that we know of). D. bili not
   consistent with hemolysis . HCT stable over last 12 hours despite
   significant fluids.
   - guaiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   .
   # FEN: NPO pending ERCP, aggressive calcium and mag repetion.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.
   .
   # Acccess: right IJ triple lumen, PIV x1.
   .
   # Code: Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, ex-wife [**Name (NI) 479**] [**Name (NI) 480**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 481**] or sister

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to concerns for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. The potential sources of infection include the biliary tract, hemodialysis line, or pulmonary infection. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and gentamicin is being administered.

The patient has remained fluid responsive and has not required vasopressors. His SvO2 is 78%, and cortisol levels are normal. He is scheduled for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) today for definitive management of gallstone pancreatitis.

The patient also has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance HD three times a week. His renal function needs to be monitored, and he will undergo HD in the morning.

Other concerns include hepatitis, hypoxia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's ECG shows ischemic changes, but there are no active symptoms. In the setting of"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with fever,
   tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
   Infectious source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, pulmonary
   source (although CXR does not support PNA). Patient has required both
   fluids and pressors overnight to maintain MAP>65. Lactate responded
   with initial fluid to 1.7, Sv02 78. Random cortisol 34.3. Patient
   currently on PS PEEP 8 FIO2 60%. In setting of unknown etiology of
   sepsis would not move to extubate at this time.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - attempt to wean off levophed today if BP is stable
   - check serial lactates
   - f/u ERCP recs and findings
   - f/u final OSH CT read, outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be [**12-31**] ERCP and
   not pancreatitis. If patient initially presented w/pancreatitis then
   standard of care would be to treat with PO nutrition, IV fluids and
   pain medication. Patient may be able to tolerate TF slowly. Monitor
   iCa, vanco/zosyn/gent as above.
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or contraindicated in treatment of
   underlying sepsis
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs and any further recommended studies (ie. RUQ US)
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal is following patient and
   suggested waiting until tomorrow to resume HD>
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD tomorrow
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP  (if any)
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction. Trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: Sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without infiltrate, no sputum or
   cough, but also on differential.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - consider ECHO to further work-up cardiac etiology and as baseline
   - telemetry
   .
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - guaiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   .
   # FEN: ?NPO pending ERCP recs; if NPO allow for IVF, aggressive calcium
   and mag repetion.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.
   .
   # Acccess: right IJ triple lumen, PIV x1.
   .
   # Code: Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, ex-wife [**Name (NI) 479**] [**Name (NI) 480**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 481**] or sister

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, consistent with sepsis. The infectious source is likely the biliary tract or HD line infection, with pulmonary source being less likely as there are no signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. The patient required both fluids and pressors overnight to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Lactate levels improved with initial fluid administration, and the mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 78%. The patient is currently on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with PEEP 8 and FiO2 60%. Due to the unknown etiology of sepsis, extubation is not recommended at this time.

The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and gentamicin for infection treatment, as well as levophed for low blood pressure. Other medications include vecuronium, fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient meets sirs criteria with fever,
   tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
   Infectious source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, must also
   consider pulmonary source w/ new O2 requirement although more likely
   from capillary leak/CHF. Patient has remained fluid responsive and has
   not required pressors. Lactate responded with initial fluid to 1.7,
   Sv02 78. Random cortisol 34.3.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - no pressors currently as still requires ivf clinically
   - check serial lactates
   - given concern for gallstone pancreatitis, definitive management with
   ERCP planned today
   - f/u final OSH CT read, outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Definitive ERCP planned for today. NPO, IVF,
   monitor iCa, vanco/zosyn/gent as above.
   - f/u OSH imaging
   - NPO
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal aware pt here
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD in am
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: suspect capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs. CHF as
   pt with known CAD, but underlying infection as CXR without infiltrate,
   no sputum or cough, but also possible.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - trend CE's
   - continue aspirin/plavix, resume post ERCP
   - hold statin with hepatitis
   - if oxygen requirement worsens, consider ECHO to evaluate EF (no ECHO
   in our system)
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - CPAP overnight if not intubated post ERCP
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Unclear baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] be low
   related to ESRD (not on epo as outpatient that we know of). D. bili not
   consistent with hemolysis . HCT stable over last 12 hours despite
   significant fluids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient meets the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels consistent with sepsis. The potential sources of infection include the biliary tract, hemodialysis (HD) line infection, and possible pulmonary source. The patient remains fluid responsive and has not required vasopressors. Lactate levels have improved with initial fluid resuscitation. The cortisol level is within normal range.

2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient is planned for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) today for definitive management of gallstone pancreatitis. The patient is nil per os (NPO), receiving intravenous fluids (IVF), and being monitored for ionized calcium levels.

3. ESRD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week as an outpatient. Renal replacement therapy will be continued during the hospital stay. 

4. Hepatitis: The patient has likely congestive hepatitis due to obstruction. Liver function tests"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and gallstone pancreatitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. The patient's condition has worsened overnight with the development of sepsis, likely of biliary origin. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics, norepinephrine infusion, and heparin prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has persistent fever and elevated blood pressure. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. Imaging studies have been ordered to further evaluate the biliary source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can result in severe lung damage.
3. Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): With the presence of sepsis and potential biliary source of infection, there is a risk of MODS, where multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possibility of pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   A)
   1: Sepsis/septic shock: most likely biliary source although will
   consider other sources such as pneumonia (CXR reveals right lower lobe
   infiltrate so could have a component of pneumonia)
   Plan:
   -          Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -          Right upper quadrant ultrasound
   -          Continue levophed - > check hemodynamic parameters including
   lactate, CI, CVP, ECHO (currently CVP 15, scvo2 80%) -> fluids/pressors
   as needed based on hemodynamics.  At the moment, will give bolus and
   see if comes off pressors.
   -          Keep intubated while Hemodynamically compromised
   -          Will check ECHO to rule out pericardial effusion as patient
   is on minoxidil and has ESRD, both contributing risk factors
   2: Acute Respiratory Failure
   Plan:
   -          Continue mechanical ventilation for now given hemodyndamic
   status
   -          When hemodynamics improve, will concentrate on weaning and
   will likely need HD prior to doing so

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of encephalopathy. The patient's temperature has been spiking overnight, and they were given tylenol, resulting in a drop in blood pressure. The patient was started on IV fluids and levophed. Currently, the patient is still on levophed at 0.04 mcg/kg/min. The patient is off sedation.

24-hour events include the insertion of a multi-lumen line, blood cultures being taken, an ERCP procedure, and the initiation of an arterial line. The patient has a fever of 102.7°F and is unable to provide a medical history due to encephalopathy.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics given was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:00 AM on 08-09-2175.

The patient is receiving norepinephrine at 0.05 mcg/kg/min, vecuronium, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm (78-137 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 116/62 mmHg to 240/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with fever,
   tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
   Infectious source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, pulmonary
   source (although CXR does not support PNA). Patient has required both
   fluids and pressors overnight to maintain MAP>65. Lactate responded
   with initial fluid to 1.7, Sv02 78. Random cortisol 34.3. Patient
   currently on PS PEEP 8 FIO2 60%. In setting of unknown etiology of
   sepsis would not move to extubate at this time.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - attempt to wean off levophed today if BP is stable
   - check serial lactates
   - f/u ERCP recs and findings
   - f/u final OSH CT read, outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be [**12-31**] ERCP and
   not pancreatitis. If patient initially presented w/pancreatitis then
   standard of care would be to treat with PO nutrition, IV fluids and
   pain medication. Patient may be able to tolerate TF slowly. Monitor
   iCa, vanco/zosyn/gent as above.
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or contraindicated in treatment of
   underlying sepsis
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs and any further recommended studies (ie. RUQ US)
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal is following patient and
   suggested waiting until tomorrow to resume HD>
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD tomorrow
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP  (if any)
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction. Trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: Sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without infiltrate, no sputum or
   cough, but also on differential.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - consider ECHO to further work-up cardiac etiology and as baseline
   - telemetry
   .
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - guaiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   .
   # FEN: ?NPO pending ERCP recs; if NPO allow for IVF, aggressive calcium
   and mag repetion.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.
   .
   # Acccess: right IJ triple lumen, PIV x1.
   .
   # Code: Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, ex-wife [**Name (NI) 479**] [**Name (NI) 480**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 481**] or sister
   [**Name (NI) 482**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 483**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), presenting with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, which are consistent with sepsis. The infectious source could be from the biliary tract or a hemodialysis line infection. The patient has required both fluids and pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.

2. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels may indicate gallstone pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is recommended.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, possibly due to sepsis or congestive heart failure (CHF). Supplemental oxygen is being provided.

4. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) suggest hepatitis, which is likely congestive due to obstruction. Regular monitoring of LFTs is advised.

5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with fever,
   tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
   Infectious source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, pulmonary
   source (although CXR does not support PNA). Patient has required both
   fluids and pressors overnight to maintain MAP>65. Lactate responded
   with initial fluid to 1.7, Sv02 78. Random cortisol 34.3. Patient
   currently on PS PEEP 8 FIO2 60%. In setting of unknown etiology of
   sepsis would not move to extubate at this time.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - attempt to wean off levophed today if BP is stable
   - check serial lactates
   - f/u ERCP recs and findings
   - f/u final OSH CT read, outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be [**12-31**] ERCP and
   not pancreatitis. If patient initially presented w/pancreatitis then
   standard of care would be to treat with PO nutrition, IV fluids and
   pain medication. Patient may be able to tolerate TF slowly. Monitor
   iCa, vanco/zosyn/gent as above.
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or contraindicated in treatment of
   underlying sepsis
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs and any further recommended studies (ie. RUQ US)
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal is following patient and
   suggested waiting until tomorrow to resume HD>
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD tomorrow
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP  (if any)
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction. Trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: Sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without infiltrate, no sputum or
   cough, but also on differential.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - consider ECHO to further work-up cardiac etiology and as baseline
   - telemetry
   .
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - guaiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   .
   # FEN: ?NPO pending ERCP recs; if NPO allow for IVF, aggressive calcium
   and mag repetion.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, which are consistent with sepsis. The infectious source could be biliary tract infection or a central line infection. The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has a bump in amylase and lipase levels, which may indicate gallstone pancreatitis. This condition requires further evaluation and management, including the consideration of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if indicated.

3. ESRD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week (M/W/F). The renal team suggests waiting until tomorrow to resume HD. It is important to follow the renal recommendations and plan for HD tomorrow while monitoring electrolyte levels and fluid status.

4. Hepatitis:"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea,
   tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis. Infectious
   source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection. Patient has been HD
   labile, with hyper/hypotension requiring fluid boluses at times. He is
   currently being dialysed which may assist with his BP. CXR this AM
   appears improved from prior, making PNA a less likely cause of his
   sepsis. ? endocarditis, as TTE was not fully able to evaluate valves
   and patient is on long-standing HD.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin until return of blood cx
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - attempt to wean off ventilator in PM
   - consider TEE r/o endocarditis
   - f/u outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be [**12-31**] ERCP and
   not pancreatitis. Enzymes continue to trend down. Consider also
   - TF unless unable to tolerate
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   - caution with volume rescucitation
   .
   # ESRD: On HD today. Will follow any renal recommendations.
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction. Trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and is suspected to have biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. He is currently being treated with IV antibiotics and is receiving dialysis to assist with blood pressure management. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with declining enzyme levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis due to the suspected biliary tract infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing management of infection is necessary.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's long-standing HD and presence of fever, there is a concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to rule out this condition.
3. Gallstone Pancreatitis: Although the patient's amylase/lipase levels are trending down, there is a possibility of gallstone pancreatitis. Further evaluation may be required, and an ERCP may be considered if necessary.
4. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are likely congestive due to obstruction. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and treating accordingly is essential.
5. Hypoxia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea,
   tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis. Infectious
   source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection. Patient has been HD
   labile, with hyper/hypotension requiring fluid boluses at times. He is
   currently being dialysed which may assist with his BP. CXR this AM
   appears improved from prior, making PNA a less likely cause of his
   sepsis. ? endocarditis, as TTE was not fully able to evaluate valves
   and patient is on long-standing HD.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with IV
   vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin until return of blood cx
   - IVF to maintain CVP 12-14, MAP >65
   - attempt to wean off ventilator in PM
   - consider TEE r/o endocarditis
   - f/u outside blood cultures
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be [**12-31**] ERCP and
   not pancreatitis. Enzymes continue to trend down. Consider also
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or contraindicated in treatment of
   underlying sepsis
   - replete calcium, monitor [**Hospital1 **] Ca levels
   - aggressive volume resuscitation
   - f/u ERCP recs and any further recommended studies (ie. RUQ US)
   .
   # ESRD: On HD as outpatient, M/W/F. Renal is following patient and
   suggested waiting until tomorrow to resume HD>
   - f/u renal recs, will plan for HD tomorrow
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - monitor UOP  (if any)
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   .
   # Hepatitis: Likely congestive with obstruction. Trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Hypoxia: Sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without infiltrate, no sputum or
   cough, but also on differential.
   - continue supplemental o2
   .
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - consider ECHO to further work-up cardiac etiology and as baseline
   - telemetry

","The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. He is currently being treated in the ICU for suspected biliary pancreatitis and sepsis.

The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, requiring fluid boluses at times. He is currently receiving IV vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin for the suspected biliary sepsis. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 550-700 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and an ABG showing pH 7.28/45/62/20/-5 with Ve of 15.1 L/min and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 89.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally with scant crackles at the bases, distended and obese abdomen, minimal bipedal edema, and 1+ dorsalis pedis (dp) pulses. Neurological examination shows that the patient is alert and oriented.

   Patient is critically ill (patient is critically ill)
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient had labile blood pressures with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. There is an ongoing assessment for sepsis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued. Cultures from ERCP need to be checked.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to decrease FiO2 and re-evaluate for possible extubation in the afternoon after running a dialysis.

3. End Stage Renal Disease: The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today.

4. Pancreatitis: There is a suspicion of pancreatitis, possibly related to ERCP. Amylase and lipase levels will be followed.

These are the potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and fever indicate the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection causing systemic inflammation.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a plan to decrease FiO2 and re-evaluate for possible extubation in the afternoon.

3. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may indicate ESRD. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as other complications.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating possible pancreatitis. This condition can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially lead to organ dysfunction.

5. Potential Line Infections: The presence of multiple lines, including a central line, arterial line, and peripheral lines, increases the risk of line infections. Regular monitoring and care are necessary to prevent these infections.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent clot formation.

7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk of developing stress ulcers due"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient has hypotension and is suspected to have sepsis. There is a fever of 102.9°F and abnormal laboratory results indicating possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 123, indicating respiratory distress and potential acute respiratory failure.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated levels of amylase and lipase suggest acute pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are needed for this condition.

4. Fatty Liver: The right upper quadrant ultrasound showed fatty liver, indicating hepatic steatosis or another liver pathology. Further investigation may be necessary.

5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The CVP is within normal range, but the CO/CI (Fick) values indicate decreased cardiac output. This suggests potential cardiovascular dysfunction or poor perfusion.

6. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest impaired renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.

7. Coagulation Abnormalities: The elevated PT/INR and P"

   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved culture data from [**Hospital3 **]. blood cultures gorwing gram
   negative bacilli specifically enterobacter in both aerobic and

   endocarditis. there are calcifications on the valves, however these are
   common in HD patients. tee fellow said they would be happy to do tee if
   we have high clinical suspicion or if patient fails to improve, however
   decision to hold off for the movement was made. Blood cultures all no

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with pancreatitis and sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. The patient's blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] showed growth of gram-negative bacilli, specifically Enterobacter, which is resistant to cefazolin but sensitive to other antibiotics. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension requiring fluid boluses and dialysis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, but it did not show any concerning findings for endocarditis. The source of infection is likely from the biliary tract or an HD line infection. The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and gentamicin, and these antibiotics will be discontinued today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever are consistent with sepsis. The infectious source could be from the biliary tract or a HD line infection.
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated amylase and lipase levels, indicating pancreatitis. This may be secondary to gallstone pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with pancreatitis and sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. The patient's blood cultures from another hospital grew Enterobacter, which is resistant to cefazolin but sensitive to other antibiotics. The patient has been on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and gentamicin, but these will be discontinued today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 167/84 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 346 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O. The patient's temperature is 37.4°C, and he has been afebrile since yesterday.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient meets the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, indicating sepsis. The infectious source could be the biliary tract or"

   presents with pancreatitis and sepsis s/p ERCP procedure.
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved culture data from [**Hospital3 **]. blood cultures gorwing gram
   negative bacilli specifically enterobacter in both aerobic and
   anaerobic bottles, resistant to cefazolin but sensitive to everything
   else. Tried to wean a little bit off the ventilator yesterday. went
   down to FiO2 of 50% at 3 pm. Spoke with tee fellow, they do not feel
   that tte showed any worrisome findings that would be concerning for
   endocarditis. there are calcifications on the valves, however these are
   common in HD patients. tee fellow said they would be happy to do tee if
   we have high clinical suspicion or if patient fails to improve, however
   decision to hold off for the movement was made. Blood cultures all no
   growth here, urine culture no growth here. Called renal, plan is to
   dialyze him again this morning. plan to also consider d/c of vanc and
   gent today. at 7 pm had to increase ventilator settings: was on fio2
   60% and PEEP of 10, so increased PEEP to 12.  Yesterday held tube feeds
   for goal of extubation, however extubation was not possible given
   elevated PEEP and FiO2 requirement. Will check on positioning of NG
   tube and then resume tube feeds after that.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with pancreatitis and sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. The patient's blood cultures from Hospital3 grew Enterobacter, which is resistant to cefazolin but sensitive to other antibiotics. The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient has been hypotensive and febrile, meeting SIRS criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is suspected to be the biliary tract or a HD line infection. The patient has received fluid boluses and is currently undergoing dialysis. The CXR appears improved from previous ones, making pneumonia less likely as the cause of sepsis.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated total bilirubin, which may be due to sepsis and ischemia or secondary to hemolysis. Further evaluation of hemolysis labs is planned. 

The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and the amylase/lipase levels are trending down. 

In addition to the above, the patient's medical history includes ESRD, respiratory failure, CAD, OSA, anemia, and other conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient may experience worsening pancreatitis, leading to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation.
3. Endocarditis: Although the TTE did not demonstrate any evidence of endocarditis, the patient remains at risk due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of MR on ECG.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated total bilirubin could indicate ongoing liver injury or hemolysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if hemolysis continues.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of further deterioration.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and significant MR on ECG, which increases the risk of cardiac events.
8. OSA: The patient's OSA may worsen due to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
9. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored due to the risk of fluid overload, especially during HD.
10. Line infections: The patient's lines, including the triple lumen in the right IJ and PIV x1, should be monitored for signs of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 and awaiting
   for culture data. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture so far. He is being intubated for 4 days so far. CXR
   seems with more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn day 5
   - patient has been afebrile since 2 days ago
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   continue to trend down.
   - Touch base with ERCP fellow
   - Abdomen CT to evaluate for position and patency of stent
   -f/u liver enzymes
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or prolongued ET requirements
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - telemetry
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - crit acutely dropped overnight, will re-check and order hemolysis
   labs
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   # FEN: NPO, will need NGT if unable to extubate within 24 horus,
   aggressive calcium and mag repetion PRN.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.
   # Acccess: right IJ triple lumen, PIV x1.
   # Code: Full.

   I reviewed the history and relevant labs and examined the patient.  I
   was also physically present with the MICU team for the key portions of
   the services provided.  I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the following:
   Overnight antibiotics simplified to just Zosyn.  Pt remains on [**Year (4 digits) 523**]:
   PSV 10, PeeP 15, 40%, RR25, VT=600
   On exam: CVP= 14 I/0 over 24hr is 6L neg but LOS I/O is still 6L
   positive
   Lungs clear;   Bowel sounds present without distention;  Bilat edema;
   neuro
 pt strong and responsive; Ext- warm and well perfused
   Lab:  Bili up to 5.2 yesterday  CXR looks a bit wet to me; Sat 95% on
   PSV 10/5;  Bld Cx + for Enterbacter
   Probs:
   1.       Enterobacter Biliary Sepsis with hypotension, now improved
   Hemodynamically
   2.       Resp failure due to #1 and #3
   3.       ESRD, on HD, with residual fluid overload
   4.       Increasing BILI post ERCP,  ? etiology
   Plan:
   1.       Talk to GI about implications of increasing Bili
   2.       Dialyze off 5-6 liters today
   3.       If all looks well tomorrow AM, and pt tolerates PSV 8/5,  he
   may be candidate for extubation

   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea,
   tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis. Infectious
   source likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection. Patient has been HD
   labile, with hyper/hypotension requiring fluid boluses at times. He is
   currently being dialysed which may assist with his BP. CXR this AM
   appears improved from prior, making PNA a less likely cause of his
   sepsis.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn
   - with blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] would d/c of vanco/gent

   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   continue to trend down.
   - today total bilirubin is elevated, may in the setting of sepsis and
   ischemia or alternatively may be secondary to hemolysis given decreased

   - TF unless unable to tolerate
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - patient got dialysis yesterday and took off 4 L, called renal fellow,
   plan is to get HD again today  (plan for 5 pm) as concern that fluid
   overload may be contributing to inability to wean off the [**Hospital3 523**]
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis likely due to a biliary tract infection or HD line infection. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/79 to 130s, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 472 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated amylase and lipase levels, elevated bilirubin, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's blood cultures grew Enterobacter resistant to cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive. 

The patient's medical conditions include gallstone pancreatitis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on HD, respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of organ dysfunction due to ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate if sepsis progresses or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function may worsen due to sepsis, inadequate fluid management, or complications related to HD.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible hepatic dysfunction. This may further complicate the patient's clinical course.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk for myocardial ischemia or infarction, especially during periods of hypotension or stress.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and there is a risk of persistent hypotension or hypertension, which may affect organ perfusion and function.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization and underlying hypercoagulable state.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished, overweight, and anxious individual who presented with high-grade fever and respiratory distress after undergoing an ERCP procedure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic heparin.

The vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F) and current temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), with stable blood pressure ranging from 130s to 140s/70s-80s mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 98% on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 at 50%.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and normal cardiovascular examination. The abdominal examination shows a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination is also within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.3 g/dL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 12.3 mg/dL. Other laboratory values are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 and awaiting
   for culture data. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture so far. He is being intubated for 4 days so far. CXR
   seems with more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn day 5
   - patient has been afebrile since 2 days ago
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   continue to trend down.
   - Touch base with ERCP fellow
   - Abdomen CT to evaluate for position and patency of stent
   -f/u liver enzymes
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or prolongued ET requirements
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - telemetry
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - crit acutely dropped overnight, will re-check and order hemolysis
   labs
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   # FEN: NPO, will need NGT if unable to extubate within 24 horus,
   aggressive calcium and mag repetion PRN.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and hypotension. He presented with fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, which are concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. The patient has been intubated for the past four days and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient has systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with a lactate level of 2.5, indicating possible septic shock. Gram-negative rods were found in the biliary fluid, but no positive cultures have been obtained so far. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn) for the underlying infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was originally intubated for SIRS with respiratory distress. However, with a fever spike and low blood pressure, he received fluid resuscitation. Now, there is worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). The patient has adequate mental status and secretions for extubation, but still requires high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

3. Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: There is a bump in amylase/lipase that may be secondary to gallstone pancreatitis or the ERCP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease, and on hemodialysis who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient was intubated initially for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) with respiratory distress but received fluid resuscitation and now has worsening pulmonary edema. The patient is being treated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected biliary sepsis. He is also on hemodialysis and has a stent in his right hepatic duct. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and an ERCP procedure is planned for tomorrow. The patient has a history of obstructive pattern due to stent occlusion. He is on multiple medications including anticoagulants, PPI, senna, and heparin. The patient's anemia is normocytic with normal RDW, likely chronic given CKD. His hemolysis labs are within normal limits. The patient's code status is full code. Disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic inflammation and fever, indicating a possible infection. If not managed promptly, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary edema and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate respiratory failure. If not appropriately managed,"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with likely
   source biliary. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture here sof ar. Currently intubated with CXR seems with
   more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn
   - patient afebrile, stable white count
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   still trending up.
   - plan for ercp tomoorow
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   - touched base with hepatology, believe this pattern of liver
   malfunction is likely due to stent occlusion as pattern is obstructive
   -continue to trend enzymes
   - currently off tube feeds, will keep NPO as for ERCP tomorrow
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - on aspirin and plavix but not getting PO which is appropriate since
   in for ERCP tomorrow, should resume s/p procedure when
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - H/H this AM is [**9-26**], which is stable from yesterday
   - iron studies
 low iron, low tibc, high ferritin which is consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease
   - will continue to follow serial [**Last Name (LF) 567**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] benefit from EPO and iron
   as outpatient
   # FEN: hold tube feeds for now, will readdress nutritional status
   tomorrow after ERCP.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined patient and have reviewed the relevant history and
   labs.  I was also present with the MICU team for the key portions of
   the services provided, and I agree with the note above, including its
   assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the following:
   Pt got 6L removed via ultrafiltration yesterday and is on tap to get 5
   L removed today.  He is anxious to get his ETT out!
   On exam: Tm= 99, P=62, BP= 128/63, Sat=97% on [**Year (4 digits) 523**]: PSV 10/ PEEP 15/
   Fi02 40%.  VT on [**Year (4 digits) 523**] = 500cc
   Pt very awake, strong.   Lungs clear, abd obese but nontender.  Skin
   jaundiced
   Lab: Bili up to 8.2 and chiefly direct.  ABG: 7.4/48/65
           Abd CT
 bibasilar opacities, either atelectasis or bibasilar
   pneumonias.  Stent seems OK.  No bile duct dilatation
   Problems:
   1.       [**Name2 (NI) **] stone pancreatitis and biliary sepsis with Enterobacter
   2.       Increasing Bilirubin, r/o due to occult stent occlusion that
   not being picked up on CT.
   3.       Bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, ? due to atelectasis vs
   pneumonia
   4.       Hypoxemia, likely due to obesity with V/Q mismatch, #3, and #5
   5.       Diastolic CHF
   6.       Resp failure, now on the [**Name2 (NI) 523**] chiefly due to #4
   7.       Chronic renal failure, with fluid overload, improving with
   ultrafiltration
   8.       CAD, s/p stent
   Plan:
   1.       Make I/O 5L neg today
   2.       Lower PEEP to 12 and does well to 8 then check ABG and assess
   his work of breathing
   3.       Convene mtg with GI/hepatology and ERCP to determine if repeat
   ERCP is necessary tomorrow
   4.       Follow Bili
   5.       If no ERCP, then can try extubation tomorrow AM if he does
   well on PEEP of 8. If ERCP in the works, then wait till he
s stable
   after it.
   6.       Needs NG feedings.  Can Dobhoff be placed in ERCP tomorrow?

","The patient is a 43-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stage V chronic kidney disease who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with a suspected source of infection in the biliary system. He is being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn) and is currently afebrile with a stable white blood cell count. Blood cultures have grown Enterobacter, which is resistant to cefazolin but sensitive to other antibiotics. The antibiotic coverage has been narrowed to Zosyn only.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for sepsis with respiratory distress. He received fluid resuscitation but is now experiencing worsening pulmonary edema despite frequent hemodialysis. The patient has adequate mental status and secretions for extubation. He requires high PEEP. 

3. Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, which may be secondary to gallstone pancreatitis or a recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. An abdominal CT showed a stent in the right position, but it was a suboptimal study for evaluating stent patency. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which could be due to stent"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 and awaiting
   for culture data. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture so far. He is being intubated for 4 days so far. CXR
   seems with more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn day 5
   - patient has been afebrile since 2 days ago
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   continue to trend down.
   - Touch base with ERCP fellow
   - Abdomen CT to evaluate for position and patency of stent
   -f/u liver enzymes
   - TF unless unable to tolerate or prolongued ET requirements
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - continue aspirin/plavix
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - telemetry
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - crit acutely dropped overnight, will re-check and order hemolysis
   labs
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u iron studies/retic/b12/folate
   # FEN: NPO, will need NGT if unable to extubate within 24 horus,
   aggressive calcium and mag repetion PRN.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin, colace, senna, PPI, ssi.
   # Acccess: right IJ triple lumen, PIV x1.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, which raised concerns for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. An echocardiogram (TTE) showed no signs of endocarditis. The patient has been intubated for four days and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His blood cultures grew Enterobacter resistant to cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive. He also has respiratory failure and worsening pulmonary edema despite frequent hemodialysis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is being treated for underlying infection with Zosyn. He has been afebrile for two days and is awaiting culture data.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but he still requires high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Daily HD will continue until fluid status improves, allowing for extubation. PEEP will be weaned down after HD, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted later today.
3. Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's amylase/lipase levels may be secondary to gallstone"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis. CT shows no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stent
   in appropriate position, despite rising Tbil and AP over several days.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient presented with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with
   a presumed biliary source. OSH blood cultures grew enterobacter
   (pan-sensitive except to cefazolin), his cultures here have otherwise
   been negative. He had GNR in the biliary fluid. Currently he is being
   treated with zosyn (today day=6). Plan for ERCP today for rising bili
   counts which may represent a biliary obstruction, and likely the
   primary cause of his sepsis. He continues to have low-grade fevers
   on-off while on antibiotics, however has remained afebrile overnight.
   Most recent CXR shows some airspace opacities, however likely due to
   positioning than infection so pulmonary process is not likely the cause
   of his fevers.
   - continue zosyn
   - trend fevers and WBC
   -f/u pending blood and sputum cultures
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   -continue HD for fluid overload
   # Respiratory failure: Patient is still requiring PEEP support on
   ventilator. [**Month (only) 11**] be candidate for extubation today, however given the
   ERCP would prefer to do this after procedure. HD has been able to
   remove significant amounts of fluid however on CXR patient appears to
   have significant congestion still. He does have HD today post-ERCP
   which will hopefully improve his fluid overload. Will continue to wean
   throughout the day to allow for extubation if clinically appropriate.
   -decrease sedation post- ERCP as tolerated
   - F/u CXR and sputum cultures
   - Try to wean down PEEP after ERCP
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Despite lack of abdominal pain
   clinically and negative CT the patients bili and AP have continued to
   increase over the last several days which is concerning for
   obstruction. Hepatology and ERCP (appreciate recommendations) suggested
   ERCP today to evaluate further.
   - plan for ercp today
   -follow-up on erpc and hepatology recs
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -NPO
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L (yesterday 4.2L off)
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders, sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - resume aspirin, plavix, statin post-ERCP
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. The patient has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation support due to respiratory failure. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and elevated lactate levels, suggesting a presumed biliary source of infection. Blood cultures grew enterobacter sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, and the patient is being treated with Zosyn. ERCP is planned today to evaluate for biliary obstruction, which may represent the primary cause of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient still requires PEEP support on the ventilator. He is a candidate for extubation but will be done after the ERCP procedure. HD has been able to remove significant amounts of fluid, but the patient appears to have significant congestion on chest X-ray. Weaning will continue throughout the day to allow for extubation if clinically appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. He is now in the ICU with several medical complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support on the ventilator due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about congestive heart failure (CHF) and infection as seen on the chest X-ray.
2. Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Despite lack of abdominal pain clinically and negative CT scan, the patient's bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels have continued to increase, which is concerning for obstruction. Hepatology and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) consultations suggest ERCP today to evaluate further.
3. Sepsis: The patient presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), lactate of 2.5, and presumed biliary source. Open surgical hematuria (OSH) blood cultures grew enterobacter (pan-sensitive except to cefazolin), and his cultures here have otherwise been negative. He has gram-negative rods (GNR) in the biliary fluid. He continues to have low-grade fevers on-off while on antibiotics, but remains afebrile overnight."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with likely
   source biliary. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture here sof ar. Currently intubated with CXR seems with
   more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn
   - patient afebrile, stable white count
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   still trending up.
   - plan for ercp tomoorow
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   - touched base with hepatology, believe this pattern of liver
   malfunction is likely due to stent occlusion as pattern is obstructive
   -continue to trend enzymes
   - currently off tube feeds, will keep NPO as for ERCP tomorrow
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - on aspirin and plavix but not getting PO which is appropriate since
   in for ERCP tomorrow, should resume s/p procedure when
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - H/H this AM is [**9-26**], which is stable from yesterday
   - iron studies
 low iron, low tibc, high ferritin which is consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease
   - will continue to follow serial [**Last Name (LF) 567**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] benefit from EPO and iron
   as outpatient
   # FEN: hold tube feeds for now, will readdress nutritional status
   tomorrow after ERCP.

An ERCP is planned for tomorrow. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and he is NPO (nothing by mouth) until the ERCP.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance HD. He will continue with daily HD until his fluid status improves to allow for extubation. The dose of all antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly. The patient will also resume phosphate binders and Sensipar when taking oral medications, and his chemistries will be monitored daily.

There are concerns about the possibility of sepsis versus congestive heart failure (CHF), although the chest X-ray does not show any infiltrates. The patient is on"

   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis. CT shows no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stent
   in appropriate position, despite rising Tbil and AP over several days.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with likely
   source biliary. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid, but
   nothing on culture here sof ar. Currently intubated with CXR seems with
   more fluids than before.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn
   - patient afebrile, stable white count
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   # Respiratory failure: Pt originaly intubated for SIRS with respiratory
   distress. However, with fever spike and low BP he received fluid
   resusitation. Now worsening pulmonary edema, despite having frequent
   hemodialysis (-6L yesterday). Patient with adequate mental status and
   secretions for extuabtion. He still requiring high PEEP.
   - Continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow extubation.
   - Try to wean down PEEP after HD
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bump in amylase/lipase may be
   secondary to gallstone pancreatitis vs. s/p ERCP procedure. Enzymes
   still trending up.
   - plan for ercp tomoorow
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   - touched base with hepatology, believe this pattern of liver
   malfunction is likely due to stent occlusion as pattern is obstructive
   -continue to trend enzymes
   - currently off tube feeds, will keep NPO as for ERCP tomorrow
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders when taking po
   - resume sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - on aspirin and plavix but not getting PO which is appropriate since
   in for ERCP tomorrow, should resume s/p procedure when
   - continue statin as shown to have some anti-inflammatory effect in
   setting of chronic disease and infection
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - H/H this AM is [**9-26**], which is stable from yesterday
   - iron studies
 low iron, low tibc, high ferritin which is consistent

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD), and on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, which raised concerns for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed no signs of endocarditis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and confirmed that the stent was in the correct position, despite rising levels of total bilirubin (Tbil) and amylase/lipase enzymes over several days.

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications. Firstly, he has hypotension/sepsis, as indicated by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), elevated lactate levels, and the presence of gram-negative rods in biliary fluid. Antibiotic coverage has been narrowed to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) due to resistance to cefazolin.

Secondly, the patient is also dealing with respiratory failure, for which he was originally intubated. He has worsening pulmonary edema, despite frequent hemodialysis sessions. The plan is to continue daily HD until fluid status improves to allow for extubation. PEEP will be gradually weaned down, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and gallstones. He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has been receiving fluids and antibiotics for suspected sepsis. His condition has improved, but he still requires high PEEP and supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary edema and dependence on high PEEP indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The plan is to continue daily HD to improve fluid status and wean down PEEP after each session. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be attempted later today for extubation.
2. Liver Dysfunction/Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient's liver enzymes are still trending up, suggesting ongoing liver dysfunction. An ERCP procedure is planned tomorrow to address possible stent occlusion. Monitoring of liver function tests and electrolytes will continue.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on HD, and the goal is to continue with 6 liters of fluid removal. Medications will be dosed appropriately with HD, and monitoring of daily chemistry will be done.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis. CT shows no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stent
   in appropriate position, despite rising Tbil and AP over several days.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient presented with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with
   a presumed biliary source. OSH blood cultures grew enterobacter
   (pan-sensitive except to cefazolin), his cultures here have otherwise
   been negative. He had gram negative rods in the biliary fluid. He
   continues to have low-grade fevers on-off while on antibiotics, however
   has remained afebrile overnight. Most recent CXR shows some airspace
   opacities and congestive failure which is new for this patient.
   Currently he is being treated with zosyn (today day=6). Plan for ERCP
   today for rising bili counts which may represent a biliary obstruction,
   and likely the primary cause of his sepsis.
   - continue to treat underlying infection with zosyn
   - trend fevers and WBC
   -f/u pending blood and sputum cultures
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   # Respiratory failure: Patient is still requiring PEEP support on
   ventilator. [**Month (only) 11**] be candidate for extubation today, however given the
   ERCP would prefer to do this after procedure. HD has been able to
   remove significant amounts of fluid however on CXR patient appears to
   have congestive picture as well as some multifocal opacities concerning
   for infection. Will continue to wean throughout the day to allow for
   extubation.
   - F/u CXR and sputum cultures
   - Try to wean down PEEP after ERCP
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Despite lack of abdominal pain
   clinically and negative CT the patients bili and AP have continued to
   increase over the last several days which is concerning for
   obstruction. Hepatology and ERCP (appreciate recommendations) suggested
   ERCP today to evaluate further.
   - plan for ercp tomoorow
   -follow-up on erpc and hepatology recs
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -NPO as for ERCP tomorrow
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L (yesterday 4.2L off)
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders, sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # Respitary failiure  - likely sepsis vs. CHF although CXR without
   infiltrate, no sputum or cough, but also on differential. CXR appears
   improved since yesterday.
   - continue supplemental o2
   - wean as tolerated from [**Last Name (LF) 523**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] again try to lower PEEP and fio2
   requirements today after hemodialysis
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - resume aspirin, plavix, statin post-ERCP
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits and hct has been stable.
   - H/H this AM is [**9-26**], which is stable from yesterday
   - iron studies
 low iron, low tibc, high ferritin which is consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease
   - will continue to follow serial [**Last Name (LF) 567**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] benefit from EPO and iron
   as outpatient

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo male admit with CAD, HTN, ESRD and initial presentation following
   HD with sepsis.  Now in the setting of concern for persistent biliary
   sepsis in the setting of return to hemodialysis and otherwise clinical
   improvement in regards to the septic insult.  He now has had repeat
   ERCP this am with drainage of what appeared to be infected fluid and
   this may contribute to furter improvement in the remaining parameters
   which suggested obstruction.
   Sepsis-Biliary source with local intervention completed this am.  He
   has had continued good preservation of filling pressures with CVP=[**11-11**]
   this am.  He has no pressor requirement at this time.  Will continue
   -Zosyn
   -F/U culture results
   -Appreciate ERCP intervention
   Respiratory Failure-his original need for intubation was driven by
   acute picture of sepsis and volume overload in setting of hypoxemia.
   He now has good hemodynamic stability and will have further volume
   removal this afternoon at HD.  Will move to extubation if stable after
   HD and good tolerance of PSV in the interim.
   Coronary Artery Disease-
   -Plavix for stent
   -Maintain good rate pressure product control
   -no evidence ischemia at this time
   -Will need BP and HR control following extubation
   Chronic Renal Disease with Acute exacerbation-
   -HD today
   -Goal if further negative fluid balance across day today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and initial presentation following hemodialysis with sepsis. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and biliary source with local intervention completed this morning. The patient has shown good preservation of filling pressures with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11-11 mmHg this morning. He is not requiring any pressor support at this time. The patient will continue on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), follow-up culture results, appreciate ERCP intervention, and move to extubation if stable after hemodialysis (HD) and good tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the interim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was sepsis following HD. Although he has received treatment and shown improvement, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to acute hypoxemia and respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and volume overload. There is a potential complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation and weaning difficulties.
3. Biliary Source of Infection: The patient has a biliary source of infection that has been addressed with ERCP intervention. However, there is still a risk of persistent infection or recurrence of biliary se"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, stage V CKF on HD who presented with
   hypotension, fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary
   pancreatitis and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning
   for endocarditis. CT shows no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stent
   in appropriate position, despite rising Tbil and AP over several days.
   # Hypotension/Sepsis: Patient presented with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with
   a presumed biliary source. OSH blood cultures grew enterobacter
   (pan-sensitive except to cefazolin), his cultures here have otherwise
   been negative. He had GNR in the biliary fluid. Currently he is being
   treated with zosyn (today day=6). Plan for ERCP today for rising bili
   counts which may represent a biliary obstruction, and likely the
   primary cause of his sepsis. He continues to have low-grade fevers
   on-off while on antibiotics, however has remained afebrile overnight.
   Most recent CXR shows some airspace opacities, however likely due to
   positioning than infection so pulmonary process is not likely the cause
   of his fevers.
   - continue zosyn
   - trend fevers and WBC
   -f/u pending blood and sputum cultures
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   -continue HD for fluid overload
   # Respiratory failure: Patient is still requiring PEEP support on
   ventilator. [**Month (only) 11**] be candidate for extubation today, however given the
   ERCP would prefer to do this after procedure. HD has been able to
   remove significant amounts of fluid however on CXR patient appears to
   have significant congestion still. He does have HD today post-ERCP
   which will hopefully improve his fluid overload. Will continue to wean
   throughout the day to allow for extubation if clinically appropriate.
   -decrease sedation post- ERCP as tolerated
   - F/u CXR and sputum cultures
   - Try to wean down PEEP after ERCP
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Despite lack of abdominal pain
   clinically and negative CT the patients bili and AP have continued to
   increase over the last several days which is concerning for
   obstruction. Hepatology and ERCP (appreciate recommendations) suggested
   ERCP today to evaluate further.
   - plan for ercp today
   -follow-up on erpc and hepatology recs
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -NPO
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L (yesterday 4.2L off)
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders, sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - resume aspirin, plavix, statin post-ERCP
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.
   Hemolysis labs are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stage V chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, which were concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed no signs of endocarditis, and a CT scan revealed a stent in the appropriate position. However, the patient's bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels continued to rise, indicating a possible biliary obstruction. The patient has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and has been on non-invasive ventilation support due to respiratory failure. His blood cultures grew Enterobacter, which is sensitive to Zosyn except for cefazolin. The patient has also been experiencing low-grade fevers despite antibiotic treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers suggests a possible septic state. The source of infection appears to be biliary, as indicated by the presence of Gram-negative rods in the biliary fluid. The patient is currently being treated with Zosyn, but the rising bilirubin and AP levels suggest ongoing biliary obstruction, which could lead to further complications if not addressed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires PEEP support on the"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, ESRD on HD who presented with hypotension,
   fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary pancreatitis
   and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning for
   endocarditis. Now s/p stent repositioning.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock:
   Patient presented with SIRS, lactate of 2.5 with a presumed biliary
   source. OSH blood cultures grew enterobacter (pan-sensitive except to
   cefazolin), his cultures here have otherwise been negative. He had GNR
   in the biliary fluid. Currently he is being treated with zosyn (today
   day=6). Plan for ERCP today for rising bili counts which may represent
   a biliary obstruction, and likely the primary cause of his sepsis. He
   continues to have low-grade fevers on-off while on antibiotics, however
   has remained afebrile overnight. Most recent CXR shows some airspace
   opacities, however likely due to positioning than infection so
   pulmonary process is not likely the cause of his fevers.
   - continue zosyn
   - trend fevers and WBC
   -f/u pending blood and sputum cultures
   - [**Hospital3 **] blood culture
 grew enterobacter resistant to
   cefazolin but otherwise pan-sensitive, narrowed antibiotic coverage to
   zosyn only (d/c gent, vanc)
   -continue HD for fluid overload
   # Respiratory failure: Patient is still requiring PEEP support on
   ventilator. [**Month (only) 11**] be candidate for extubation today, however given the
   ERCP would prefer to do this after procedure. HD has been able to
   remove significant amounts of fluid however on CXR patient appears to
   have significant congestion still. He does have HD today post-ERCP
   which will hopefully improve his fluid overload. Will continue to wean
   throughout the day to allow for extubation if clinically appropriate.
   -decrease sedation post- ERCP as tolerated
   - F/u CXR and sputum cultures
   - Try to wean down PEEP after ERCP
   - If doing ok SBT later today with goal for extubation tonight or
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Despite lack of abdominal pain
   clinically and negative CT the patients bili and AP have continued to
   increase over the last several days which is concerning for
   obstruction. Hepatology and ERCP (appreciate recommendations) suggested
   ERCP today to evaluate further.
   - plan for ercp today
   -follow-up on erpc and hepatology recs
   - Abdomen CT to showed stent in right position, however suboptimal
   study for eval of stent patency
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -NPO
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD; goal -6L (yesterday 4.2L off)
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders, sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - resume aspirin, plavix, statin post-ERCP
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - intubated
   # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, this may be chronic given CKD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. The patient was initially suspected to have biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and had a stent placed in his biliary system.

The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for a presumed biliary source of sepsis. His blood cultures grew enterobacter, which is sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam except for cefazolin. The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is on CPAP therapy.

The patient's respiratory status has been concerning, requiring positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support on the ventilator. There are concerns about fluid overload, as evidenced by the patient's congestion on the chest X-ray and the need for hemodialysis to remove excess fluid.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. There is concern for biliary obstruction, and an ERCP was planned to further evaluate this.

The patient's anemia is normoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of RUQ pain, fever, and jaundice. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, where a stent was replaced. The patient also received a hemodialysis session today and was extubated in the late afternoon, tolerating oral intake and using CPAP overnight. A rash was observed on the patient's chest and back, initially thought to be an allergic reaction to lotion, but later the patient complained of itchiness on the legs. Benadryl 25mg PO was given once. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, which was given this morning. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new rash. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/71 mmHg to 148/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 132.4 kg, with a height of 71 inches. Central venous pressure is 3 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,356 mL since"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo male admit with respiratory failure and acute cholangititis now
   s/p extubation and ERCP intervention.  He has tolerated extubation well
   but remains with significant component of volume overload and will need
   continued dialysis for support.  In the background is signficant
   obstructive sleep apnea which does require treatment with CPAP at
   patients baseline settings.
   1)Sepsis-
   Improved and resolved now with residual volume overload
   will complete ABX course as defined but will have to consider change in
   ABX choice due to rash likely related to medicaitons with Zosyn
   suspected.
   -D/C A-line
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   Extubation
   Will need CPAP support O/N due to h/o OSA and may help with lung
   recruitment.
   OOB to chair with goal to ambulate today
   3)Renal Failure-
   Continue with HD
   4)Cholangitis-
   -Improved enzymes and exam
   -Willl monitor LFT
s daily and expect small and transient (lasting
   seconds) pain to diminish
   -ERCP team to follow
   -Would prefer change in ABX based upon micro data
   -Enterobacter was identified
   5)Rash-
   -likely drug related rash
   -Will complete course with Gent and continue to total of 14 day course.
   5)CAD-
   ASA/PLavix/Simvastatin/Lopressor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and acute cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and extubation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 mmHg to 157/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and requires CPAP support. The patient also has significant volume overload and requires continued dialysis for support. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's rash is likely drug-related and is suspected to be related to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient will complete the course of antibiotics with Gentamicin and continue the total of 14-day course. The patient's sepsis has improved and resolved, but they still have residual volume overload. The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and they have tolerated extubation well. They will need continued CPAP support overnight due to their history of obstruct"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. The patient underwent stent repositioning and is now hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient previously experienced septic shock from a biliary source. Although currently stable, there is a risk of recurrence if the infection does not resolve.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP for respiratory support due to likely obesity-related sleep apnea (OSA) and difficulty tolerating it recently. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if CPAP is not effective.

3. Drug Rash: The patient developed a drug rash likely due to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Switching to ciprofloxacin is recommended, and consideration should be given to a dermatology consult if the rash does not improve.

4. Liver Function/Gallstone Pancreatitis: Although bilirubin and liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, ongoing monitoring is required to assess liver function and progress in gallstone pancreatitis.

5. ESRD/Hemodialysis: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition appears to be stable with controlled vital signs. The patient is receiving CPAP for respiratory support and has an oxygen saturation level of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and their blood pressure is within the normal range.

The patient's current weight is 132.4 kg, which shows a slight decrease from their admission weight of 138 kg. The central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range at 12 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,910 mL, with outputs including 1,780 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 130 mL through intravenous fluids, and 5 mL each of blood products and urine. The total output is 1,905 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 145 mL.

The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total CO2 (TCO2), and lactate. The WBC count is slightly elevated, indicating a possible infection. The elevated Hct and Plt levels may indicate hemoconcentration or dehydration. The elevated Cr level suggests impaired kidney function. The TCO2 level indicates a respiratory acidosis, possibly due to the patient's underlying condition or respiratory support.

The patient's other lab results show abnormal values in various parameters, including elevated levels of CK"

   43 yo man with CAD, HTN, ESRD on HD who presented with hypotension,
   fever, pancreatitis and hepatitis concerning for bilary pancreatitis
   and biliary sepsis.  TTE as per cardiology not concerning for
   endocarditis. Now s/p stent repositioning.
   # Hypotension/Septic shock: Patient s/p septic shock from  biliary
   source , enterobacter (pan-sensitive except cefazolin). Here cultures
   negative so far. On zosyn however given drug rash zosyn was stopped
   yesterday and switched to ciprofloxacin. .
   - continue benadryl for rash, if not improving consider steroids
   -continue  ciprofloxacin
   - trend fevers, WBC
   -trend bili
   -f/u pending blood and sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure: On CPAP overnight with sats in low 90%. Today on
   RA in high 80s. Continue NC or shovel mask to improve oxygenation. This
   is likely given to patients body habitus and laying down in bed, as O2
   sats improve to low 90s when he sits up.
   - F/u CXR and sputum cultures
   -F/u fluid balance
   -CPAP overnight
   .
   # Rash: compatible with drug rash. Most likely due to zosyn, so
   switching to ciprofloxacin
   -stopped offending zosyn
   -if doesn
t improve over next 2-3 days would consider other source
   -if rash expands, itching is worse or he develops respiratory
   compromise start steroids
   -Benadryl PRN itching
   # Liver function/Gallstone pancreatitis: Bilirubin trending down after
   ERCP yesterday.
   -follow-up on erpc and hepatology recs
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -Start clears and progress diet.
   # ESRD: On HD
   - continue HD;
   - dose all abx w/ HD
   - resume phos binders, sensipar when taking po
   - monitor chem daily
   # CAD: S/p stent in [**1-6**], still on plavix so suspect DES. Records at
   [**Hospital1 475**]. ECG with some ischemic changes of unclear duration, no active
   symptoms. CE stably elevated on admission. In setting of ESRD, unlikely
   to be acute event however will continue to cycle since in setting of
   hypotensive episodes there is concern for ischemia. Echo shows
   significant MR.
   - On ASA, plavix, statin and beta blocker
   # OSA: Witnessed apenic episodes while asleep. Known h/o of OSA on CPAP
   as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
   - On CPAP overnight with good results
   # FEN: advance as tolerated, replete electrolytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension, fever, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, which are concerning for biliary pancreatitis and biliary sepsis. The patient underwent stent repositioning. He has been diagnosed with septic shock from a biliary source, enterobacter (pan-sensitive except cefazolin). The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ASA, Plavix, statin, and beta-blocker. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic shock: The patient has already experienced septic shock from a biliary source. Close monitoring of vital signs, trend fevers, and WBC count is essential. Cultures should be followed up, and the patient should continue on ciprofloxacin.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on RA (respiratory assistance) in the high 80s. Oxygenation should be improved with the use of NC (nasal cannula) or shovel mask. A follow-up chest X-ray and sputum cultures are necessary.

3. Rash: The patient has a drug rash likely due to Zosyn. The offending medication has been stopped, and the patient has been switched to ciprofloxacin. If the rash"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo male with ESRD and on HD now treated for biliary source of sepsis
   and with respiratory failure resolved patient has shown encouraging
   early tolerance of CPAP overnight.  He, however, has had some further
   evlution of the diffuse macular [**Last Name (un) 638**] noted to evolve over yestereday.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will utilize CPAP at night
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Out of bed to chair and goal to ambulate today.
   2)Biliary Sepsis-
   -Continue with antibiotics and monitor response over time as we have
   continued improvement in parameters
   -Expecte 14 day course overall
   -D/C CVL and A-line
   -Will utilize Cipro going forward
   3)Rash-
   -Still most likely drug erruption given timing, nature and evolution
   -The concern is for the peticheal component and the fact that we have
   been incomplete in managing the symptoms
   -Will therefore consult dermatology given atypical evolution with
   plaques on elbow and peticheae in lower extermities
   -Sarna lotion to skin
