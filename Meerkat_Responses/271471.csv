   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with shortness of breath and fever. They are currently on invasive ventilation support in the ICU. The patient has been unresponsive, intubated, and sedated since admission. They are receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they exhibit signs of respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the noted conditions. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, glucose, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's EKG shows changes consistent with demand. The assessment and plan include continuing free water repletion for hypernatremia, weaning FiO2 and performing neuro exams for respiratory failure, treating pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, evaluating dehydration/hypernatremia, monitoring coagulopathy, and addressing acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to weaning attempts, progression of pneumonia leading to sepsis, worsening hypernatremia if fluid repletion is not managed appropriately, further deterioration of renal function, and potential bleeding complications due to coagulopathy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with shortness of breath and fever. They were intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/48-125/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, as well as free water repletion for hypernatremia. The patient's mental status is altered, with non-reactive pupils and a negative head CT scan. The patient's coagulation status is improving, but there are concerns about acute-on-chronic renal failure, abrasions on the knee, and potential EKG changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings, and the plan is to continue weaning the ventilator and potentially extubate within 24 hours. Close monitoring of respiratory function is necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Pneumonia/Sepsis: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, but there is a risk of complications associated with pneumonia and sepsis, such as organ dysfunction, shock, and secondary infections.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, and free water repletion is ongoing. Monitoring electroly"

   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to dense pneumonia that was seen on
   portable CXR.  Intubated in ED for tachypnea and WOB.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - wean sedation to assess neurologic exam and mental status.
   - daily RSBIs if indicated
   - daily wake-ups
   - HOB elevation / PPI / VAP bundle
   - ABGs prn
   - will hold off on a-line tonight given ? goals of care and possible
   DNR/DNI/CMO discussion currently ongoing with family
   # Sepsis: Secondary to pneumonia seen on CXR. Given patient living in
   [**Hospital3 2781**], he is at risk for healthcare associated pneumonia.
   - Treat with vancomycin / cefepime / ciprofloxacin
   - send sputm culture
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - continue sedation and mechanical ventilation as above
   - monitor lactate
   - IVF hydration as below
   - if not maintaing BPs, will initiate pressors
   # Altered mental status: Pupils nonreactive, consider  ? bleed
   - Head CT no acute bleed

   - monitor Hct
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - f/u GI input
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated Troponins: Elevated Troponin may be secondary to renal
   failure, but must also rule out ACS. EKG not able to compare to
   baseline, but cards believes demand ischemia.
   - CE q8 hours x 3
   - check EKG
   - appreciate cards input
   # Coagulopathy: PT, PTT, INR all elevated. Likely interaction between
   recent flagyl use and coumadin.  But also may be secondary to DIC,
   although platelets within normal limits.
   - send fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin, peripheral smear to r/o DIC
   - trend coags

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 67-year-old male, was admitted with recent history of pneumonia and presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. He is currently intubated for respiratory failure due to dense pneumonia seen on portable CXR. The patient also has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, altered mental status with nonreactive pupils, possible GI bleeding, elevated troponins indicating possible renal failure or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coagulopathy likely due to medication interaction or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, hypernatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, hypertension (HTN), possible urinary tract infection (UTI), and stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) need to be closely monitored.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially septic shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to coma or other neurological complications if not properly managed.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient's presentation of tachycardia and altered mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with recent history of pneumonia, fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. He was found to have pneumonia and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to pneumonia, altered mental status, GI bleeding, elevated troponins, coagulopathy, CKD stage 4, hypernatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with plans to wean as tolerated. Antibiotics have been started for the pneumonia and sepsis. Sedation and mechanical ventilation continue, along with monitoring of vital signs and lab results. The patient's HOB (head of bed) elevation, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) bundle, and ABGs (arterial blood gases) are being followed. DNI (do not intubate) has been decided upon, and the plan is to extubate when appropriate. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to dense pneumonia. The risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infection should be monitored closely.

2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. There is a risk of progression to septic shock or multiple organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 2781**] with recent history of pneumonia,
   presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy, found to
   have pneumonia and now intubated for respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to dense pneumonia that was seen on
   portable CXR.  Intubated in ED for tachypnea and WOB. RSBI suggests
   able to extubate, on minimal vent settings and off sedation.
   - extubate today, per family, no re-intubation
   - S&S after extubation
   - HOB elevation / PPI / VAP bundle
   - ABGs prn
   - treat PNA with vanc / cefepime / cipro
   # HCAP: Secondary to pneumonia seen on CXR. Given patient living in
   [**Hospital3 2781**], he is at risk for healthcare associated pneumonia.
   - Treat with vancomycin / cefepime / ciprofloxacin
   - f/u sputum culture
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - IVF hydration as below
   # Altered mental status: Pupils nonreactive, Head CT no acute bleed. ?
   cataract surgery. Off sedation, pt continues to be altered, ? if this
   is his baseline or new baseline.
   - would like HCP to provide collateral information
   - treat infection as this could be etiology of delirium
   - treat pain with tylenol 1000 TID and morphine prn from R arm
   # Leukocytosis: Slightly elevated today from yesterday; likely due to
   underlying pneumonia, but also has sacral decub that does not appear
   infected
   - monitor WBC count
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx treatment which would also cover skin orgs
   (MRSA)
   # R arm pain: Was worked up at [**Hospital1 587**] per OSH records.  Pt was in extreme
   pain of R arm. Xrays were reportedly normal there.  Vascular surgery at
   [**Hospital1 587**] imaged arm and saw no signs of infection.  Neuro at [**Hospital1 587**] wondered if
   this was RSD and pt on neurontin. Neurontin being held currently due to
   AMS.
   - X-ray R arm
   - tylenol TID
   - morphine prn
   # GI Bleeding: Baseline Hct 27.  Now 25.  Guaiac + in ED.
   - monitor Hct
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - f/u GI input
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated Troponins: CE remained flat without any EKG changes.
   Elevated Troponin may be secondary to renal failure. EKG not able to
   compare to baseline, but per OSH records had old Q waves in inferior
   leads.
   - EKGs prn
   # Coagulopathy: INR coming down after 10mg IV vitamin K.  Now 1.6
   - trend coags
   - no active evidence of bleeding, so will start heparin gtt with
   coumadin bridge
   # CKD, Stage 4: Recently discharged with Cr 2 from [**Hospital1 587**]. Now 3.6
   - trend Cr
   - IVF hydration
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose all meds
   - f/u  SPEP, UPEP given renal failure and anemia
   - continue calcium acetate, renal caps
   # Hypernatremia: currently 147 and will need to slowly recorrect,
   completed D5W x 20 hours at 120 cc.
   - 1 L D5W today
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Type 2 DM: will need tight control as giving D5W.
   - HISS
   - QIDACHS FS
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Zetia and Lipitor
   # HTN: hold beta blocker and amlodipine in setting of ? GI bleed,
   continues to be normotensive
   # ? UTI: UA grossly bloody and may be false +. 2^nd UA with gross

   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition: ICU for now
 potential c/o after extubation
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to dense pneumonia. There is a plan to extubate the patient, but they may experience respiratory distress or failure after extubation.

2. Healthcare Associated Pneumonia (HCAP): The patient has pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray, and given his living situation in a hospital, he is at risk for healthcare-associated pneumonia. This requires appropriate treatment with antibiotics.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status with non-reactive pupils and a head CT showing encephalomalacia of the left hemisphere. This could be due to various causes such as infection, cataract surgery, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to the underlying pneumonia or a sacral decubitus ulcer. Monitoring the WBC count and following up with cultures are necessary.

5. Right Arm Pain: The patient has severe pain in the right arm, which was worked up at another hospital. It could be related to vascular or neurologic issues. Further evaluation and pain management are required.

6. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of baseline Hct 27%, now 25%, with guaiac positive in the ED."

   67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 2781**] with recent history of pneumonia,
   presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy, found to
   have pneumonia and now intubated for respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to dense pneumonia that was seen on
   portable CXR.  Intubated in ED for tachypnea and WOB. RSBI suggests
   able to extubate, on minimal vent settings and off sedation.
   - extubate today, per family, no re-intubation
   - S&S after extubation

   - Continue to treat with vancomycin / cefepime / ciprofloxacin
   - f/u sputum culture
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - IVF hydration as below
   # Altered mental status: More awake off sedation, follows simple
   commands.
   - would like HCP to provide collateral information
   - treat infection as this could be etiology of delirium
   - treat pain with tylenol 1000 TID and likely okay to restart
   neurontin.
   # Leukocytosis: Slightly elevated today from yesterday; likely due to
   underlying pneumonia, but also has sacral decub that does not appear
   infected
   - monitor WBC count
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx treatment which would also cover skin orgs
   (MRSA)
   # R arm pain: Was worked up at [**Hospital1 587**] per OSH records.  Pt was in extreme
   pain of R arm. Xrays were reportedly normal there.  Vascular surgery at
   [**Hospital1 587**] imaged arm and saw no signs of infection.  Neuro at [**Hospital1 587**] wondered if
   this was RSD and pt on neurontin. Will restart neurontin today at a
   dose of 100mg PO TID.
   - tylenol TID
   - morphine prn

   - f/u GI input
   - IV PPI daily
   # Elevated Troponins: CE remained flat without any EKG changes.
   Elevated Troponin may be secondary to renal failure. EKG not able to
   compare to baseline, but per OSH records had old Q waves in inferior
   leads.
   - EKGs prn
   # Coagulopathy: INR coming down after 10mg IV vitamin K.  Now 1.6

   CONSENT SIGNED
   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition: ICU for now
 potential c/o after extubation
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a recent history of pneumonia who presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. He was intubated for respiratory failure due to dense pneumonia seen on portable chest X-ray. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), altered mental status, leukocytosis, right arm pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated troponins, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, hypernatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), and a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is still intubated, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections such as pneumonia, HCAP, and possibly a UTI. These infections can worsen the patient's condition and lead to sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has evidence of GI bleeding indicated by a decreasing hematocrit level and positive guaiac test. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Cardiac complications: Elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac involvement, possibly myocardial injury or"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 2781**] with recent history of pneumonia,
   presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy, found to
   have pneumonia and now intubated for respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to dense pneumonia that was seen on
   portable CXR.  Intubated in ED for tachypnea and WOB. RSBI suggests
   able to extubate, on minimal vent settings and off sedation.
   - extubate today, per family, no re-intubation
   - S&S after extubation
   - HOB elevation / PPI / VAP bundle
   - ABGs prn
   - treat PNA with vanc / cefepime / cipro
   # HCAP: Secondary to pneumonia seen on CXR. Given patient living in
   [**Hospital3 2781**], he is at risk for healthcare associated pneumonia.
   - Continue to treat with vancomycin / cefepime / ciprofloxacin
   - f/u sputum culture
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - IVF hydration as below
   # Altered mental status: More awake off sedation, follows simple
   commands.
   - would like HCP to provide collateral information
   - treat infection as this could be etiology of delirium
   - treat pain with tylenol 1000 TID and likely okay to restart
   neurontin.
   # Leukocytosis: Slightly elevated today from yesterday; likely due to
   underlying pneumonia, but also has sacral decub that does not appear
   infected
   - monitor WBC count
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx treatment which would also cover skin orgs
   (MRSA)
   # R arm pain: Was worked up at [**Hospital1 587**] per OSH records.  Pt was in extreme
   pain of R arm. Xrays were reportedly normal there.  Vascular surgery at
   [**Hospital1 587**] imaged arm and saw no signs of infection.  Neuro at [**Hospital1 587**] wondered if
   this was RSD and pt on neurontin. Will restart neurontin today at a
   dose of 100mg PO TID.
   - tylenol TID
   - morphine prn
   - portable cxr.
   # GI Bleeding: Baseline Hct 27.  Now 25.  Guaiac + in ED.
   - monitor Hct
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - f/u GI input
   - IV PPI daily
   # Elevated Troponins: CE remained flat without any EKG changes.
   Elevated Troponin may be secondary to renal failure. EKG not able to
   compare to baseline, but per OSH records had old Q waves in inferior
   leads.
   - EKGs prn
   # Coagulopathy: INR coming down after 10mg IV vitamin K.  Now 1.6
   - trend coags
   - no active evidence of bleeding, so will start heparin gtt with
   coumadin bridge
   # CKD, Stage 4: Recently discharged with Cr 2 from [**Hospital1 587**]. Now 3.6
   - trend Cr
   - IVF hydration
   - renally dose all meds
   - f/u  SPEP, UPEP given renal failure and anemia
   - continue calcium acetate, renal caps
   # Hypernatremia: currently 147 and will need to slowly recorrect,
   completed D5W x 20 hours at 120 cc.
   - 1 L D5W today
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Type 2 DM: will need tight control as giving D5W.
   - HISS
   - QIDACHS FS
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Zetia and Lipitor
   # HTN: hold beta blocker and amlodipine in setting of ? GI bleed,
   continues to be normotensive
   # ? UTI: UA grossly bloody and may be false +. 2^nd UA with gross
   blood.  ? foley trauma
   - follow
   - consider resending UA, urine cytology

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Remains on the vent due to volume loss and pna on the left. Appears
   ready for extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with recent history of pneumonia, fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. He was found to have pneumonia and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation due to volume loss and pneumonia on the left side. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 140/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to dense pneumonia seen on portable chest X-ray. There is also evidence of atelectasis and worsening consolidation in the left upper lobe.
2. Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia (HCAP): The patient is at risk for HCAP due to living in a healthcare facility. He is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is more awake off sedation and follows simple commands. There is a possibility of delirium, and further evaluation is needed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has slightly elevated white blood cell count, likely due to underlying pneumonia.
5. Right Arm Pain: The patient experienced severe pain in the right"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male from Hospital3 2781 who presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and intubated. The patient has been extubated and is now on comfort measures only, transitioning to hospice care. His sodium levels have improved, and he is being given a thickened diet. An arm X-ray was taken, but the results are not yet available. Legionella testing was negative. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and pain management. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he does have coarse breath sounds and a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, carbon dioxide, and glucose levels. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is receiving supportive care with supplemental oxygen as needed. The plan is to control pain and consult palliative care. The patient's disposition is transfer to the floor for hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of pneumonia and recent intubation, there is a risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken if necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a recent history of pneumonia who presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy. The patient was found to have pneumonia and successfully extubated on [**11-8**]. Currently, the patient is receiving comfort measures only and is transitioning to hospice care.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP): The patient was previously intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing HCAP. This type of pneumonia is often caused by bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was previously on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. The use of compression boots is mentioned as prophylaxis against DVT, but close monitoring and early detection are crucial.

4. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole (Protonix) to prevent the development of stress ulcers, which are common in critically ill patients.

5. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has been on invasive ventilation but successfully extubated. The family has decided to pursue hospice and comfort care. The patient is receiving antibiotics, pantoprazole, and other medications. His sodium levels have improved, and he is being fed through the mouth with a thickened diet. An arm x-ray was obtained but no gross fracture was found. Legionella negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to immobility, pressure from lying in bed, or inadequate nutrition.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates abnormalities, which can increase the risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
3. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance that can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or dehydration.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management. This condition can worsen if the patient's respiratory function deteriorates further.
5. Pressure Ulcers: Due to prolonged immobilization, the patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted with pneumonia and has recently undergone invasive ventilation. The patient is now extubated and has been transitioned to comfort measures only, with plans for hospice care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing healthcare-associated pneumonia. This can be identified by symptoms such as fever, increased respiratory rate, and worsening oxygenation.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Early recognition and prevention through the use of compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis are important to prevent this complication.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, indicating a risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is important.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of developing VAP due to previous invasive ventilation. Monitoring for symptoms of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating a potential risk of dehydration. Close monitoring of intake and output will be necessary to ensure adequate hydration.

6. Wound healing: The presence of a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 2781**] with recent history of pneumonia,
   presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy, found to
   have pneumonia, s/p extubation on [**11-8**], now comfort measures only,
   transitioning to hospice.
   # Healthcare associated pneumonia: Now extubated
   - continue vancomycin / cefepime x 8 days (day 4 / 8)
   Pt is now comfort measures only, but will continue antibiotics as
   clinically appears better.  Plan is to control pain with neurontin and
   morphine bolus doses, consult palliative care today, supplemental
   oxygen as needed. No lab draws. Will talk with SW, CM, and palliative
   to attempt to have patient transitioned to hospice.

   Disposition:Transfer to other facility
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and subsequently developed healthcare-associated pneumonia. He has been placed on comfort measures only and is transitioning to hospice care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/52 to 102/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is able to follow simple commands, wiggle his toes, and has a light gag reflex.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit level of 25.3%. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,282 mL and an output of 1,410 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -128 mL. The patient's respiratory support has been discontinued as he is now extubated.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: Since the patient was previously intubated and required invasive ventilation, there is a risk of respiratory failure if he experiences airway obstruction or inadequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: As the patient has pneumonia, he is at risk of developing further infections, especially healthcare-associated infections due to his prolonged hospital stay"
