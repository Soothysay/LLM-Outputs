   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: No infiltrate on CXR.  No skin lesions.  Has
   some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect likely pathogens such
   as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.  Less likely would be cdiff (although
   possible given abd pain).
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now
   - neupogen 480 daily per d/w onc
   - f/u pan-cultures
   - check cdiff if stools
   - BP support with IVF for now.  Goal SBP>90
   .
   # Hypotension: as above.  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as
   pt admits to poor PO intake.  Plus has unmeasurable losses with
   tachycardia and fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.
   - ivf bolus for SBP<90.  consider maintenance IVF o/n.
   - rx w abx as above.
   - maintain current IV access for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old woman with newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia. She has been receiving chemotherapy (CHOP regimen) and is now experiencing hypotension and fever. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, nausea/vomiting, sulfa medications, and hives. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood count results show neutropenia with a count of 1.7 K/uL and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The plan includes empirical antibiotic therapy with cefepime and vancomycin, administration of Neupogen, and fluid support to maintain blood pressure above 90 mmHg. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further interventions will be based on her response to treatment. Potential complications that can arise include sepsis due to febrile neutropenia, hypotension leading to organ dysfunction, and possible infections from opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas or E. coli."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who is admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. She has been experiencing fever spikes throughout the day and night, with temperatures reaching up to 104.3°F. The patient's blood cultures, including fungal and urine cultures, have been taken. She is allergic to codeine, sulfonamides, and experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) on August 4th and 5th, respectively, as well as acyclovir for presumed oral HSV.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 40.2°C (104.3°F), current temperature of 39.6°C (103.3°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/49 to 112/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, normal platelet count of 150 K/uL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values include sodium at 140 mEq/L, potassium at 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride at 110 mEq/L. Imaging shows no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusions on the chest X-ray.

Plan:
The patient is being treated for febrile neutropenia with cefepime and vancomycin, as well as for possible Clostridium difficile infection. She is receiving IV fluids for hypotension and will continue stress dose steroids. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient's condition will be re-evaluated. An echocardiogram will be performed to further evaluate the abnormal cardiac silhouette seen on the chest X-ray. The patient's oncology treatment plan will be continued, including the use of Neupogen to increase white blood cell count."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: No localizing infection.  No infiltrate on CXR.
   No skin lesions.  Has some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect
   likely pathogens such as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now
   - neupogen decreased to 300 x1 per onc request
 fup re: neupogen
   - f/u pan-cultures
   - will reculture Q 24 hrs if continues to spike fevers.  given fevers
   and rigors
   .
   # Hypotension:  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as pt admits
   to poor PO intake.  Plus has immeasurable losses with tachycardia and
   fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.
   - Patient on maintenance NS @ 125.
   - rx w abx as above.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25
   - maintain current IV access for now
   .
   # CXR
 concern for abnormal cardiac silhouette based on CXR.
   Radiology feels it may be due to increased fluid in lungs vs. rotation
   of patient.  Will obtain Echo to further eval.
   .
   # Heme/onc: d10 s/p CHOP.  Neupogen as above.  Goal HCT>25.
   - low uric acid so discontinued allopurinol per onc rec.
   - apprec heme/onc recs
   .
   # LFT abnl: likely from lymphoma.  generally improving.  Trend prn
   .
   # abd pain: diffuse and mild and improved with BM.   Pt endorses
   constipation.  Rx with bowel regimen for now.  If has spiking fevers
   and worsening pain, consider typhlitis and make pt NPO.  Continue diet
   fow now.
   .
   # REN -- repleting lytes as necessary
   # mucositis
 start acyclovir for presumed oral HSV.  [**Month (only) 11**] also use
   lidocaine swish for comfort.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. She has a history of chemotherapy (CHOP regimen). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.3°F, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient reports symptoms of mild sore throat, irritation during swallowing, shortness of breath when febrile, and discomfort during bowel movements. She denies cough and abdominal pain.

The patient's physical examination reveals a small shallow ulceration on the inside of the upper lip, white plaques on the buccal mucosa consistent with thrush, clear lungs, rapid heart rate with regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallops, soft and non-tender abdomen, and mild edema in the lower extremities bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 151 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 27.0%. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging shows a chest X-ray with subtle motion artifacts due to breathing, no evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is showing signs of immunocompromise and has neutropenia. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and an SpO2 of 97%. Her physical examination reveals cervical adenopathy, crackles in the basilar region of the chest, and absent peripheral pulses. Laboratory results show leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and will be undergoing an echocardiogram due to a change in cardiac configuration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: Given the patient's septic state, there is a risk of multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and neutropenia increase the risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Thrombosis: The absence of peripheral pulses raises concerns for peripheral arterial thrombosis or embolism, which can lead to limb ischemia.
4. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulants increase the"
