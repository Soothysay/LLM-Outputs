","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), mitral stenosis (MS), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a pacemaker, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient has been started on dopamine/dobutamine drip to increase blood flow to the kidneys and improve urine output (UOP). If there is no increase in UOP, Lasix drip will be initiated. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed to monitor central venous pressure (CVP). ACE inhibitors have been held due to acute on chronic renal failure (RF).

The patient's aortic valve area is 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20, indicating severe aortic stenosis (AS). It needs to be decided whether the patient can wait for valve repair or requires a valvulotomy.

The patient has a history of MI x2 treated with PTCA/stent/CABG. Recent catheterization showed native triple vessel disease (3VD). The patient is currently on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg, clopidogrel, and pravastatin for CAD management.

The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) x2 and is not receiving anticoagulation. Amiodarone is being continued for atrial fibrillation (AFib) management.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) medication, glyburide, has been held, and risperidone (RISS) has been started. Levothyroxine is being continued for hypothyroidism. Omeprazole is being continued for GIB prophylaxis.

The patient's emergency contact numbers are provided. The patient's code status is presumed full, and the disposition is pending resolution of the above-mentioned issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient is currently experiencing a CHF exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis may progress, leading to worsening heart failure symptoms, syncope, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Native Triple Vessel Disease: The patient has triple vessel disease in the native coronary arteries, which increases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and subsequent heart failure.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may recur if anticoagulation is initiated or if there is a progression of underlying conditions.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if fluid balance is not carefully managed, leading to oliguria, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
6. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who is currently admitted to the ICU for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. He has a history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 111/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion at 8 mcg/kg/min for cardiac support.

Physical examination revealed jugular venous distention (JVD) midneck, a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, bibasilar crackles on chest auscultation, soft and non-tender abdomen, bilateral lower extremity edema, and no skin abnormalities.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (353 K/uL), hemoglobin (10.0 g/dL), creatinine (4.6 mg/dL), glucose (113 mg/dL), and electrolyte imbalances. Coagulation profile showed prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

Assessment and plan include exacerbation of CHF with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 24 on admission, requiring optimization of fluid balance and diuresis. The patient also has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20, requiring valve revision. There is a history of multiple coronary artery disease events with native triple vessel disease, necessitating revision coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the future. The patient has atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation due to history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he is on amiodarone for rhythm control. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism requiring medication management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Exacerbation of CHF: The patient's symptoms of JVD, bibasilar crackles, and elevated CVP indicate fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress if not managed appropriately.
2. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient's valve area of 0.7 indicates severe obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, which can cause symptoms of syncope, angina, and heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of multiple coronary artery events and native triple vessel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), homograph (likely referring to a heart valve replacement), atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is currently experiencing a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. 

Potential medical complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's current condition of CHF exacerbation can lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area of 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20 indicates severe AS. If left untreated, it can lead to syncope, heart failure, and even sudden cardiac death.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD and previous MI puts him at risk for recurrent ischemic events such as unstable angina or another MI.
4. Diabetic complications: The patient's DM2 requires careful management to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, and other long-term complications like nephropathy or retinopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male who presented with acute heart failure, both systolic and diastolic. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and medications. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to show signs of fluid overload. Laboratory results indicate abnormal electrolyte levels and elevated cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's acute heart failure and low blood pressure, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of bibasilar crackles on physical examination suggests pulmonary edema, which is a common complication in patients with heart failure. It can worsen respiratory function and lead to respiratory distress.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate impaired renal function. This can be further exacerbated by the patient's low blood pressure and fluid overload, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.
4. Arrhythmias: Heart failure can increase the risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm is crucial to prevent and manage any potential arrhythmias.
5. Infection: Immobility and the use of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Prophylactic antibiotics and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, heart failure, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic stenosis. He presented to the ICU with an exacerbation of congestive heart failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80s to 90s systolic and 50s to 60s diastolic, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure of 21 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's elevated CVP and symptoms suggest ongoing heart failure. Continued use of dopamine to improve cardiac output and diuretics such as Lasix and/or metolazone may be necessary. Monitoring CVP and urine output is also crucial.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.4 has increased to nearly 5, indicating significant renal dysfunction. This could be pre-renal due to decreased renal perfusion or intrinsic renal damage from catheterization. Holding ACE inhibitors and following up with urine electrolytes would be appropriate.

3. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 92/54 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 bpm. The patient is being supported with dopamine infusion at 10 mcg/kg/min. The patient's temperature is within normal range, respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) with prominent right ventricular outflow tract murmur.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels from 1.4 to 4.6 mg/dL. The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and urine electrolytes suggest a pre-renal etiology. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but glucose levels are significantly elevated at 348 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. The patient presented with congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. The patient underwent a homograph procedure for aortic stenosis but still requires surgery due to a valve area of 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20. He also requires revision coronary artery bypass grafting in the future. The patient's current medications include ASA 325, amiodarone, levothyroxine, omeprazole, pravastatin, and RISS. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation is indicated by elevated central venous pressure (CVP) on admission and still elevated today. This may lead to pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure with a significant increase in creatinine from baseline. This could progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infections.

3. AS: The patient's aortic sten"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), as well as aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, and hypertension. The patient presented with congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's elevated CVP and crackles in the lungs indicate fluid overload, which may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.
2. ARF: The patient's increased creatinine level suggests worsening renal function, which can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid retention, and the need for dialysis.
3. AS: The patient's valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20 indicate severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to syncope, angina, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death if left untreated.
4. CAD: The patient's history of CAD and recent catheterization showing native triple vessel disease suggest a high risk for future myocardial infarctions and the need for further revascularization procedures.
5. GIB: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of future bleeding events, particularly if anticoagulation therapy is required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU for worsening symptoms. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ventricular pacing, hypotension, and renal failure. He has been receiving dopamine and dobutamine infusions to support blood pressure and cardiac function. His urine output has been decreasing, and there have been attempts to restart diuretics. The patient's blood glucose levels are running low due to acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has allergies to amlodipine and Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl). He is currently on dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min and receiving dextrose 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's heart failure is worsening, which can lead to further complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
2. Renal Complications: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are running low, and if not closely monitored, can lead to severe hypoglycemia.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), aortic stenosis (AS), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He was admitted to the ICU due to an exacerbation of CHF. The patient's current medications include dopamine, metoprolol, furosemide, amiodarone, and levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's current presentation suggests worsening heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other parts of the body. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and his recent creatinine levels have significantly increased. Acute renal failure can occur due to various reasons, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys or kidney injury. This can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
3. AS (aortic stenosis): The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient of 20. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), atrial fibrillation (Afib), mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). He presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, acute renal failure (ARF), and septic shock. The patient underwent homograft placement for AS and had a recent cardiac catheterization. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypothyroidism, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's elevated CVP and crackles on both sides of the chest indicate fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
2. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) if not managed appropriately.
3. AS: The patient's narrowed valve area and mean gradient indicate significant aortic stenosis. If left untreated, it can lead to syncope, angina, heart failure, and eventually become life-threatening.
4. CAD: The patient's history of MI, CABG, and native 3-vessel disease increases the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), history of myocardial infarction (MI), history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypothyroidism, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently admitted to the ICU for exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is experiencing hypotension and renal insufficiency. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient has an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and crackles in both lungs, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to further respiratory distress and worsening heart failure symptoms.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's recent cardiac catheterization and use of contrast dye may have contributed to renal insufficiency. This can result in the accumulation of waste products in the blood and potentially lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has a valve area of 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20, indicating severe aortic stenosis. If left untreated, this condition can lead to syncope, heart failure, and potentially sudden cardiac death.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, hyperlipidemia (HL), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). He presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has been in the ICU since [date] for further management.

24-hour events:
Renal consulted due to poor flow in the left stent, but the right stent is widely patent. Renal hypotension is attributed to chronic problem associated with CHF exacerbations by the cardiologist. The patient's BiV PPM upgrade suggestion is being discussed by the attendings, leaning towards not doing it.

Allergies:
- Amlodipine: general swelling
- Flomax (Oral) (Tamsulosin Hcl): hypotension; arrhythmia

   24 Hour Events:
    Renal consulted. Renal u/s showed poor flow in left stent but widely
   patent right stent. Renal concerned about new hypotension but according
   to patient's cardiologist this is a chronic problem usually associated
   with his CHF exacerbations. We felt this was sufficient explanation for
   his hypotension/shock and no need for another tte.
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 359**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] consulted. Suggested upgrading to BiV PPM for better

   shock that appears multifactorial.  Exam is not consistent with
   critical AS, as S2 is preserved and murmur is not late peaking.  Timing

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. 

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can be caused by factors such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, acute renal failure, and chronic renal insufficiency.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine level of 1.4, but it has now increased to close to 5 after recent catheterization. The likely cause of ARF is a combination of poor renal perfusion due to low cardiac output and contrast nephropathy from the catheterization procedure. 

3. Chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of chronic heart failure, as indicated by elevated central venous pressure (CVP) on admission and still elevated today. The patient is receiving dopamine to improve cardiac output while allowing mean arterial pressures (MAPs) to be lower.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD with two previous myocardial infarctions (MI) and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Recent catheterization showed native triple vessel disease, indicating ongoing issues with coronary circulation.

5. Aortic stenosis (AS): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient has been receiving various treatments including dopamine infusion for better cardiac output and to allow lower mean arterial pressure (MAP), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and fluid restriction. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/41 mmHg to 104/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, BUN, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and electrolytes are also provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for bilateral"

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic stenosis. He presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.4, which has increased to almost 5 after recent catheterization. There are multiple potential medical complications that can arise, including further deterioration of renal function, worsening CHF, and potential need for cardiac surgery due to significant aortic stenosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and hypothyroidism. The patient presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF) after undergoing a cardiac catheterization. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's CHF exacerbation is indicated by low blood pressure, elevated central venous pressure (CVP), bibasilar crackles on chest examination, and the need for urine fomentation. If not managed properly, there is a risk of worsening heart failure, fluid overload, and potential cardiogenic shock.
2. ARF: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with an increased creatinine level from 1.4 to almost 5 after the recent catheterization. This indicates acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not addressed. Poor renal perfusion and contrast nephropathy are contributing factors.
3. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient's AS is severe with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient of 20. Without surgical intervention, the patient may develop further hemodynamic compromise and increased risk"

 2.5 lt off yesterday. CVP improving
   to 14 today from mid 20s on admission. Continue dopamine drip for
   better CO while allowing MAPs to be lower (goal=50).
   - hold ACEI in setting of acute on chronic RF
   - plan to wean off dopa today as pressure tolerates
   - Will f/u Dr.[**Name (NI) 6567**] recs re: BiV pacer if able to lie flat this week
   may help his CO

   tolerate may need uf again
   #. ARF: Patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline
   creatinine 1.4 but now increased to close to 5 after recent cath.
   Likely combination of poor renal perfusion in setting of low CO and
   contrast nephropathy. Cre continues to improve post cath with UF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and acute heart failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and difficulty weaning from dopamine infusion. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/49 to 107/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight has decreased from 77.5 kg at admission to 75.6 kg currently. The patient is receiving dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min and has multiple IV lines, including a dialysis catheter. Lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels and low blood glucose levels. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Other lab results show abnormalities in liver enzymes and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued instability in blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there have been instances where weaning dopamine resulted in a significant drop in blood pressure. This suggests that the patient may have ongoing hemodynamic instability, which could lead to complications such as hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. If left untreated or uncontrolled, acute renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib), mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS), for which he underwent homograft surgery in 4969. The patient is diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and is currently receiving dopamine drip for better cardiac output (CO) while allowing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to be lower.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with an increased creatinine level from 1.4 to close to 5 after recent catheterization. This is likely due to a combination of poor renal perfusion and contrast nephropathy. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being continued.

The patient's aortic valve area is 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20, indicating severe AS. Repeat surgery for AS is planned, and the patient may also undergo valvuloplasty at some point.

The patient has a history of MI and CABG and requires revision CABG surgery in the future. Plavix is being stopped in preparation for surgery.

The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is not receiving anticoagulation. Amiodarone"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), mitral stenosis (MS), aortic stenosis (AS), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypothyroidism, and a previous upper gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).

The patient presented to the hospital with an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). He was found to have poor renal function with a baseline creatinine of 1.4, which further increased to close to 5 after recent catheterization. He is currently on a dopamine drip for better cardiac output while allowing lower mean arterial pressures (MAPs). His CVP has improved from mid-20s on admission to 14 today. He is also on ultrafiltration (UF) and diuresis with medical therapy.

The patient's recent cardiac catheterization showed native triple vessel disease (3VD) and a valve area of 0.7 with a mean gradient of 20, indicating severe aortic stenosis. He is scheduled to have another surgery for AS, and eventually, he may require revision CABG and valvuloplasty.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including acute kidney injury (ARF), severe AS, CAD with native 3VD, atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), atrial fibrillation (Afib), mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to poor renal perfusion and contrast nephropathy. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuations in blood pressure and urine output. The patient is currently on dopamine for better cardiac output, and fluid restriction has been implemented to manage the CHF exacerbation. The patient's renal function is improving with ongoing ultrafiltration (UF). The plan is to wean off dopamine and assess the need for diuretics such as Lasix. The patient may require repeat surgery for AS, and revision CABG is also being considered. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is not on anticoagulation for Afib. The patient's thyroid function needs to be rechecked due to high TSH levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of CHF, including low blood pressure, elevated central venous pressure (CVP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and contrast nephropathy. He underwent a homograft surgery for AS. His current medications include amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levothyroxine, and omeprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's history of CAD, previous MI, and CABG surgery puts him at risk for recurrent CHF exacerbations. His current presentation with bibasilar crackles and biventricular pacing may indicate fluid overload. The use of diuretics like Lasix is appropriate to manage fluid retention, but careful monitoring is required due to the risk of hypotension and renal dysfunction.

2. AKI: The patient has shown improvements in renal function post catheterization and ultrafiltration (UF), but the rising creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal dysfunction. Contrast nephropathy is a possible cause, which can be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes"

   CHF exacerbation
   # CHF exacerbation: Most likely [**1-4**] renal failure. UF off yesterday;
   appears euvolemic on exam. Lasix was given to promote diuresis but
   minimal u/o. Would try higher dose today, 100mg IV and increase as
   needed, or even lasix ggt. Will follow up with renal today to see if he
   may need to be on long term dialysis.
   - hold ACEI in setting of acute on chronic RF
   - plan to wean off dopa today as pressure tolerates
   - Will f/u Dr.[**Name (NI) 6567**] recs re: BiV pacer Thursday
   # ARF: Improved post cath and UF (cre from 5 to 1.8 then 2), but now
   cre increasing again. Likely [**1-4**] contrast nephropathy. Cre continues to
   improve post cath with UF.

   -cont ASA 325
   -stop plavix in preparation for surgery
   -cont pravastatin
   # Afib: No anticoagulation because of hx of upper GIB x2.
   -cont amiodarone  QOD
   # DM2: hold glyburide
   -start RISS
   # Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine. Check T3 and T4 given high TSH.
   [**Month (only) 60**] need slightly more levoxyl.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/49 mmHg to 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving dopamine at a rate of 7 mcg/kg/min and has been weaned off vasopressin.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,195 mL and output of 685 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 510 mL. The patient's weight is currently 75.5 kg, which is slightly lower than the admission weight of 77.5 kg.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 33.2%, platelet count of 41 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 156 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia (K+ of 2.3 mEq/L), hyponatremia (Na+ of 135 mEq/L), and hypermagnesemia (Mg++ of 2.0 mg/dL).

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a paced rhythm with preserved S2 and no thrills, lifts, S3, or S4.

Assessment and plan include the following:

1. CHF exacerbation: Most likely secondary to renal failure. The patient continues to be euvolemic on exam and has improved urine output with the use of lasix. Hold ACE inhibitors in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): Likely secondary to contrast nephropathy. Improved post catheterization and ultrafiltration, now stable at a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. Continue to monitor.
3. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient underwent homographic valve replacement. The valve area is 0.7, and the mean gradient is 20. The patient will require repeat surgery for AS in the future.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): CAD complicated by MI x2, treated with percut"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall and 75.5 kg individual admitted to the ICU. They have a history of allergies to amlodipine and general swelling, as well as an allergy to Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/49 to 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 77.5 kg at admission to 75.5 kg currently. They have received 100 mg of lasix in the morning and evening, as well as dopamine at a dose of 7 mcg/kg/min. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,195 mL and a total output of 685 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 510 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask, and their ABG results are pending. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. Laboratory results indicate elevated potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, along with decreased urine output. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating. The assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, along with decreased urine output, indicate potential acute renal failure. If left untreated, this condition can lead to further kidney damage and the need for dialysis.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's fluctuating glucose levels, particularly the low value of 90 mg/dL, indicate hypoglycemia. If not managed properly, hypoglycemia can result in seizures, brain damage, and even death.
3. Heart failure: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest acute heart failure. If not adequately treated, heart failure can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing and potentially leading to respiratory failure.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can become infected and lead to serious complications if not properly managed.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of allergies to amlodipine and Flomax. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/49 mmHg to 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving dopamine at a dose of 7 mcg/kg/min and has been given lasix twice, totaling approximately 300 cc of fluid output. He is also receiving n-acetyl cysteine for an upcoming bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient's weight has decreased from 77.5 kg at admission to 75.5 kg currently. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,195 mL, with 157 mL coming from IV fluids, 630 mL from PO intake, and 565 mL from TF intake. Total output includes 685 mL of urine, 500 mL of blood products, and 343 mL of drain output. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently elevated, ranging from 96 mg/dL to 170 mg/dL. His serum potassium levels have been within normal range, but his creatinine levels have increased from 1.6 mg/dL to 2.3 mg/dL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention/stent placement (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient was admitted for exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute kidney injury (AKI).

24-hour events include administration of lasix twice, weaning of dopamine dosage, and initiation of N-acetyl cysteine for pre-balloon inflations.

Vital signs are stable, with blood pressure ranging from 105/49 to 116/62 mmHg, heart rate between 70-70 bpm, respiratory rate between 7-21 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is receiving dopamine at a rate of 7 mcg/kg/min and has a urinary output of 685 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention/stent placement (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker. The patient presented to the hospital with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's CHF symptoms have worsened, leading to fluid retention and low urine output. The patient is currently off ultrafiltration (UF), but urine output has improved with the use of furosemide (Lasix).
2. ARF: The patient's kidney function is impaired, likely due to contrast nephropathy from recent cardiac catheterization. There has been some improvement in kidney function after catheterization and UF, but the patient remains stable with a serum creatinine level of 2.3.
3. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20. He underwent homograft surgery for AS, and repeat surgery may be required in the future.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD with previous MI and CAB"

The patient's heart rhythm is AV paced. They weigh 75.5 kg currently, down from 77.5 kg at admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,220 mL and total output of 1,095 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received blood products. Respiratory support is not required, with an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination findings are not available due to non-assessment of certain parameters. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention/stent placement (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has hypertension (HL), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a homograph in the left ventricle. The patient presents with aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (Afib) after pacemaker placement. He is currently experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest worsening heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and potentially leading to respiratory failure.
2. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If not managed appropriately, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Contrast Nephropathy: The recent use of contrast agents during cardiac catheterization can cause kidney damage, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction.
4. AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient of 20. If left untreated, this can lead to further cardiac complications and may necessitate repeat surgery in the future.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention to the left circumflex artery, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure.

The patient underwent placement of a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) yesterday. His triple lumen catheter was pulled out of the cordis but the cordis was left in place, and two pigtail catheters (PIVs) were placed. However, the cordis was never drawn. The patient is on vancomycin for prophylaxis against pacemaker-related infection due to a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/48 mmHg to 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3°C (99.1°F), and his current temperature is 35.7°C (96.2°F).

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and decreased plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, and aortic stenosis. He presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient underwent placement of a biventricular pacemaker (BiV/ICD) yesterday and continues to require low-dose dopamine for blood pressure support. His renal function is improving, with a current creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's urine output has improved to approximately 40 cc/hr without the use of lasix.

The patient's aortic valve area is 0.7, and his mean gradient is 20. He has been advised that he will need repeat surgery for aortic stenosis in the future.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, omeprazole for gastrointestinal bleeding, and statins and aspirin for coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF exacerbation may be due to renal failure, disynchronous ventricular contraction, and aortic stenosis. It is important to monitor his fluid balance, heart rhythm, and oxygenation levels.
2. ARF: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), hyperlipidemia (HL), diabetes mellitus (DM), and homocysteine (homograph) with aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (Afib), mitral stenosis (MS), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). He was admitted with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient underwent placement of a biventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) yesterday and continues to require dopamine (dopa) support. His renal function is improving, and he is being weaned off lasix. The right upper extremity (RUE) swelling is likely dependent edema, as evidenced by a negative ultrasound (US).

The patient's aortic valve area is 0.7 cm² with a mean gradient of 20 mmHg, indicating severe aortic stenosis (AS). He requires repeat surgery for AS in the future. The patient also has triple vessel disease (3VD) and is on aspirin (ASA) and statin therapy for CAD. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding ("

He has euvolemic status on examination. His vital signs are stable, but he has bibasilar crackles on chest examination. He has dependent edema in his right lower extremity, which is improving. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's condition is likely due to contrast nephropathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, and the current presentation suggests an exacerbation. Factors such as renal failure, disynchronous ventricular contraction, and aortic stenosis may be contributing to this exacerbation.
2. ARF: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast nephropathy. Monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary.
3. AS: The patient has aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20. Repeat surgery for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of MRSA and had a triple lumen pulled out of the cordis but with the cordis left in and two pivs placed. The patient also experienced poor urine output during the day but improved after being npo and receiving the PPM. 

The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal limits. The blood pressure is on the lower side. The patient is on dopamine infusion and has been prescribed omeprazole. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The flow sheet data indicates the patient's fluid balance, intake/output, and weights. The patient has received a total of 1,206 mL of fluids in the last 24 hours, with 846 mL given through IV fluids. The patient's urine output is recorded at 940 mL in the last 24 hours. 

The physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating throughout the day. Other lab results such as hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. 

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and acute heart failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, further episodes of hypoglycemia, and exacerbation of heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic stenosis (AS). He presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). 

24-hour events include being off dopa, map stable in mid-50s, and the patient refusing a 250 cc bolus at 9 pm. Allergies include amlodipine, general swelling, and hypotension. The patient has been on various antibiotics, with the last dose of vancomycin being given at 02:20 PM on [date]. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 70-73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 83/49-119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 19-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%. The patient's weight is 75.5 kg, and height is 71 inches. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1220 mL, with 890 mL given orally, 330 mL given intravenously (IV), and a total output of 850 mL including 0 mL of blood products. Urine output is at 850 mL, and there is no mention of NG or stool output. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG analysis, but the results are not provided. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished middle-aged male who is oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect. There is no jugular venous distention (JVD) observed, and the point of maximal impulse (PMI) is located in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. The patient has a preserved S2 sound and no thrills, lifts, S3, or S4 murmurs. Bibasilar crackles are heard in the chest, and there is bilateral lower extremity edema up to the ankles.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 6.9-9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) ranging from 31.5-33.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 141-249 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.5-2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 90-163 mg/dL, and various other lab values including sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphate (PO4), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cardiac enzymes.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of CAD, previous MI, PCI to LCx, HF, Afib with pacemaker, MS, and AS. He presented with CHF exacerbation and ARF. The CHF exacerbation is most likely due to renal failure, although improvement was seen after the placement of a biventricular (BiV) pacemaker. The patient requires dopa support and will have the cordis pulled today as he consistently has normal pressures off dopa. 

The ARF is likely contrast nephropathy, which is improving daily. Urine output is approximately 40 cc/hr off of lasix, and creatinine is improving to 1.5. 

The patient also has AS with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient of 20, indicating the need for repeat surgery in the future. He has a history of CAD with two MIs, previously treated with PCI and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient is on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg and a statin. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation (Afib) without anticoagulation due to a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) twice. He is on amiodarone QOD. 

The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and his medication for glycemic control is being held. He is also on omeprazole for GIB. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), as well as a homograft for aortic stenosis (AS). He also has atrial fibrillation (Afib) after pacemaker implantation, mitral stenosis (MS), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

24-hour events:
- Off dopa
- MAP stable in mid-50s
- Patient refused 250 cc bolus at 9 pm

Medical history:
- CAD s/p MI s/p CABG and PCI to LCx
- HL (likely hypertension)
- DM
- Homograph for AS
- Afib s/p pacemaker
- MS and AS p/w CHF exacerbation and ARF

Assessment and Plan:
1. CHF exacerbation:
   - Most likely due to renal failure and dsynchronous ventricular contraction.
   - s/p biventricular (BiV)/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
   - ECHO and cardiac output (CO) are better.
   - Urine output (U/O) continues to improve.
   - Off dopa with MAP in 50s.
   - Hold ACE inhibitor in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - Pull cordis.

2. ARF:
   - Likely contrast nephropathy, improving daily.
   - Creatinine (Cre) improving to 1.5.
   - Will continue to monitor.

3. AS:
   - s/p homographic [Name (NI) 4969].
   - Pt with valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20.
   - Need repeat surgery for AS in the future.

4. CAD:
   - CAD c/b MI x2 s/p PTCA/stent/CABG.
   - Recent cath showed the native 3-vessel disease.
   - On aspirin (ASA) 325 mg and statin.

5. Afib:
   - No anticoagulation due to history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) x2.
   - Continue amiodarone QOD.

6. DM2:
   - Hold glyburide, RISS.

ICU Care:

- Glycemic control:
- Lines: Cordis/introducer - [2112-3-15] 11:00 PM, 18 Gauge - [2112-3-24] 01:00 PM, 22 Gauge - [2112-3-24] 01:00 PM
- Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF exacerbation is likely due to renal failure and dsynchronous ventricular contraction. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and cardiac function is essential to prevent further exacerbation.

2. ARF: The patient's ARF is likely due to contrast nephropathy. Continued monitoring of renal function, including serum creatinine levels and urine output, is necessary to assess the progression of renal failure and guide further management.

3. AS: The patient's AS is severe, with a valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20. Repeat surgery for AS may be required in the future to improve the patient's symptoms and quality of life.

4. CAD: The patient's CAD with previous MI and CABG indicates a high risk for further cardiac events. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and adherence to medications such as aspirin and statins are important to prevent future complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker and mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis. The patient's current condition includes being off dopamine with mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s, hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, and a planned transfusion for hematocrit (Hct) <30 and Lasix later today based on labs. The patient's urine output has been improving, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's worsening heart failure symptoms may lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately. This could result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.
3. Contrast nephropathy: As the patient has received contrast media during catheterization, there is a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, which can worsen renal function and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who is currently admitted to the ICU for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic stenosis. The patient's recent events include pulling out his Cordis/ introducer, which was promptly stopped, and he was consulted by a perfusionist. He has shown improvement in his overall condition, being able to walk in the halls with the nurses and having a decrease in urine output. His allergies include amlodipine and Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl), with a history of general swelling. The last dose of antibiotics given was Vancomycin on [**2112-3-26**] at 12:56 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's CHF exacerbation is likely due to renal failure and dysynchronous ventricular contraction. This exacerbation is being managed by holding ACE inhibitors in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, and the patient may require a transfusion for a low hematocrit level and Lasix later today based on lab results.
2. ARF: The patient's ARF is likely due to contrast nephropathy,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, there are several significant events and observations documented.

The patient experienced a cordis/introducer stop on [**2112-3-26**] at 12:33 PM. This event was followed by pulling the cordis, consultation with a perfusionist, and the patient being able to walk in the halls with the nurses, looking great. The patient's urine output decreased to 200cc over 17 hours and was asked to increase oral intake.

The patient has allergies to amlodipine and Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl), both causing general swelling and hypotension.

The last dose of antibiotics administered was vancomycin on [**2112-3-26**] at 12:56 PM.

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions and other ICU medications, but the specific names and dosages are not provided in the progress note.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Flow sheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F) and 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate between 70-73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/48 mmHg to 105/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%.

The patient's weight has decreased from 77.5 kg at admission to 75.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,640 mL, with 1,440 mL being oral intake, 200 mL intravenous fluids, and a total output of 255 mL urine and 100 mL blood products. The calculated fluid balance is 1,385 mL positive.

The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and the ABG results are not provided in the progress note.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessments, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and other systems not assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic).

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, heart failure, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic stenosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute renal failure (ARF).

24-hour events include the initiation of Plavix therapy, stable hemoglobin concentration, improved urine output, and a slight increase in creatinine level. The patient did not receive Lasix due to concerns about contrast nephropathy from recent dye exposure. The patient's blood pressure has been maintained around 100/60 mmHg, and his heart rate has been stable between 70-74 beats per minute.

Physical examination findings include normal airway, breathing, and circulation, with crackles in the mid-lung zones bilaterally and diffuse expiratory wheezes. The patient has mild pitting edema in both lower extremities, with the right leg showing more swelling. His radial pulses are 2+ and both extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct) at 30.2%, and increased creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include CHF exacerbation, ARF, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. The CHF exacerbation is likely due to renal failure and dysynchronous ventricular contraction. The ARF is suspected to be caused by contrast nephropathy, which is improving daily. The patient's aortic valve area is significantly narrowed, indicating a need for future surgery. The patient has a history of MI and CAD, for which he is on aspirin and statin therapy. His atrial fibrillation requires ongoing management due to a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

ICU care includes monitoring the patient's urine output, hemoglobin concentration, and creatinine levels. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in his condition and will receive appropriate interventions as needed."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has a homograph for aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), and aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

Key findings and assessments include:

1. CHF exacerbation: The patient likely experienced this due to renal failure and dysynchronous ventricular contraction. He underwent biventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and his ECHO and cardiac output (CO) have improved. The patient's urine output continues to improve, and he is being managed with appropriate medications.

2. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating potential contrast nephropathy. However, his urine output has improved, suggesting a positive response to treatment.

3. AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20. He requires repeat surgery for AS in the future.

4. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD with two instances of MI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, homograft for aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation. He presented with congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and has improved echo and cardiac output. He is currently off dopamine with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s. His urine output continues to improve, and he will likely need a transfusion for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 30 and furosemide (lasix) later today based on labs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's worsening heart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion (SOB) and crackles to mid-lung zones bilaterally, indicate potential complications related to congestive heart failure exacerbation. Factors contributing to this exacerbation may include renal failure and dysynchronous ventricular contraction.
2. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest acute renal failure. The most likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He also has atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis (MS), aortic regurgitation (AR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a homograph. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF exacerbation is likely secondary to renal failure and dysynchronous ventricular contraction. The patient has a history of CAD, previous MI, CABG surgery, and a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Close monitoring of his fluid balance, cardiac function, and respiratory status is crucial to prevent further exacerbation.
2. ARF: The patient's ARF is likely due to contrast nephropathy, which can occur after the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent worsening renal function and potential complications such as volume overload or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient of 20"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention to the left circumflex artery, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, homograph for aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation. He presented with congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CHF exacerbation: Most likely due to renal failure and dys synchronous ventricular contraction. The patient underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, and his ejection fraction and cardiac output have improved. Urine output continues to improve. The patient is off dopamine with a mean arterial pressure primarily in the 50-60s. Hold ACE inhibitors in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure. Will likely administer lasix later today, based on lab results. Monitor hematocrit and transfuse if less than 30. Restart metoprolol at 25 mg.

2. ARF: Likely contrast nephropathy, improving daily. Creatinine increased to 1.9 yesterday, but urine output remains at 30 cc/hr. Draw labs later today.

3. AS: Post homographic valve replacement, with a valve area of 0.7 and a mean gradient"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man CAD s/p MI s/p CABG and PCI to LCx, HL, DM, homograph
   [**Telephone/Fax (3) 4969**] in [**2097**] for aortic stenosis,  Afib s/p pacemaker , MS and AS p/w
   CHF exacerbation and ARF.
   # CHF exacerbation: Most likely [**1-4**] renal failure, Dysynchronous
   ventricular contraction must have contributed to the exacerbation.
   - s/p BiV/ICD . ECHO and CO are better. U/O continues to improve. Off
   dopa with MAP primarily 50-60s.
   - hold ACEI in setting of acute on chronic RF
   - Will likely lasix later today; will evaluate based on labs.
   - monitor Hct, transfuse for Hct<30
   # ARF: Likely [**1-4**] contrast nephropathy, improving daily. Creatinine
   increased to 1.9 yesterday, patient did not have labs drawn yet today.
   However, urine output continues at 30cc/hr.
   - Labs later today
   # AS: s/p homographic [**Name (NI) 4969**], pt with valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient
   of 20. [**Month (only) 60**] need repeat surgery for AS in the future.
   # CAD: CAD c/b MI x2 s/p PTCA/stent/CABG. Recent cath showed the native
   3VD.  On ASA 325 and statin.
   # Afib: No anticoagulation because of hx of upper GIB x2. Cont
   amiodarone  QOD
   # DM2: hold glyburide, RISS
   # GIB: cont omeprazole [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, mitral stenosis, and aortic stenosis. He presents with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments, including bi-ventricular (BiV) pacing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), homographic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, and medication adjustments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation:
   - Dysynchronous ventricular contraction due to BiV pacing may have contributed to the exacerbation.
   - The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - Hold ACE inhibitors in the setting of acute on chronic RF.
   - Will likely administer lasix later today; labs will be evaluated based on the results.
   - Monitor hematocrit (Hct) levels and transfuse if Hct < 30.

2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure):
   - Likely contrast nephropathy, improving daily.
   - Creatinine increased to 1.9 yesterday, but urine output continues at 30 cc/hr.
