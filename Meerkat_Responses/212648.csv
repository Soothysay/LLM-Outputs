   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30%) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF Arrest : s/p arctic sun cooling which was started at 8:00am on
   [**2131-12-29**], approx. 12h after arrest.  In terms of etiologies of VF, the
   most likely cause is ischemic.
   - continue arctic sun for 24h
   - monitor on tele
   - contine intubation
   - A-line placement today
   - TTE today
   - if recovers, need ICD

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, and systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 25-30% prior to this admission). The patient experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 due to sedation. The patient is unresponsive to voice or light, with no spontaneous movement. Vital signs show a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg.

The patient's cardiac monitoring shows regular rhythm without murmurs, clear lung sounds bilaterally, and normal bowel sounds. Peripheral pulses are present but cool extremities are noted. The patient has no skin abnormalities assessed. Neurologic examination reveals no response to voice or light, no spontaneous movement, and no assessed tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid levels. Troponin T levels are slightly elevated, while other cardiac enzymes and markers are within normal limits. White blood cell count is elevated, and urine analysis shows positive findings suggestive of pre-renal azotemia.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine levels of 1.4-1.5, which has worsened during admission. The patient is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection.

Additionally, the patient has normocytic normochromic anemia with high red cell distribution width (RDW), indicating iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin B12 and folate levels are pending.

The patient's plan includes completing the Arctic Sun protocol for targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest, weaning sedation as tolerated, performing a computed tomography (CT) head without contrast per neurology recommendations, and evaluating the patient by electrophysiologist for possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or urinary tract infection), acute kidney injury, and bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs, cardiac rhythm, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters will be crucial in managing these potential complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD
   on:[**2131-12-30**] 09:36 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, recent NSTEMI, hypertension, and heart failure. The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia arrest and was successfully resuscitated. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring pressors, anemia with signs of iron deficiency, acute kidney injury with improvement after fluid management, and potential urinary tract infection indicated by a positive urinalysis. The patient is also receiving treatment for suspected pneumonia and has a history of asthma, which appears to be stable. 

The patient's cardiac function has significantly deteriorated, with an ejection fraction of 15-20% observed on a recent echocardiogram. The patient also has a history of mitral regurgitation, which remains stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to the severely reduced ejection fraction, further deterioration of renal function, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, and progression of anemia if the reticulocyte count does not improve. Additionally, the patient's hypertensive condition may require careful management once the pressors are weaned off."

   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - ICD this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.

   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation. Patient also dehydrated given diarrhea.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - Unclear etiology at this time. Pt has dirty UA, clean
   CXR, diarrhea at rehab. She is also after cardiac arrest, that itself
   could cause leukocytosis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, and heart failure. She experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, likely secondary to ischemia after the NSTEMI. The patient underwent an Arctic Sun protocol for targeted temperature management. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%, with akinesis of the left ventricular inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere. This represents stunned myocardium.

The patient's current plan includes completing the Arctic Sun protocol, weaning sedation as tolerated, performing a computed tomography (CT) head without contrast today per neurology recommendations, implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) this admission, resuming beta-blockers once blood pressure allows, and weaning off dopamine.

The patient has a rhythm disturbance with a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and left bundle branch block (LBBB) without meeting criteria for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: At 3.4; related to low cardiac output and pressors.
   Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   -          follow
   -          improve fluid status and reseasess plan
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation
   .
   # Gout
 patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertension, and systolic heart failure. She experienced a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation arrest and required resuscitation.

The patient's current condition is critical, and she is being treated in the ICU. She is sedated and intubated. The note mentions several medical complications that have arisen during her stay:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a baseline creatinine level of 1.4-1.5 and presented with a creatinine level of 3.3. This indicates acute renal failure, which may be due to sepsis, c-diff infection, intravascular volume depletion, and the use of pressors.

2. Clostridioides difficile (c-diff) Infection: The patient developed diarrhea, and tests confirmed the presence of c-diff infection. This infection is likely related to the use of levofloxacin. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole.

3. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient's white blood cell count has increased, with a significant presence of bands (22%). This suggests a possible infection or inflammatory response.

4. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 3"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, who experienced a VF/VT arrest and was successfully resuscitated. She was admitted to the ICU for ongoing management.

The patient's medical complications include acute renal failure, likely secondary to her recent use of levaquin and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. She also has a C. diff infection, as evidenced by her positive stool culture and elevated WBC count with bands. This infection has contributed to her worsening metabolic acidosis and is being treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with an EF of 15-20% and akinesis of the LV inferior wall, suggesting significant ischemic damage. She has been on an Arctic sun protocol for cardiac resuscitation but has required increasing doses of dopamine, which has now been switched to norepinephrine. An ICD is planned when the patient is stable.

Her anemia is normocytic normochromic with a high RDW, indicating possible iron deficiency. A transfusion of one unit of pRBC was given due to a low hct of 24, which responded to a hct of 29.

The patient is currently on multiple pressors and will need to be weaned off them as tolerated. Sedation will also be weaned, and RISBI and breathing trials will be considered. Beta-blockers will be"

   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, hypertension, and chronic heart failure. She experienced a ventricular tachycardia arrest and was resuscitated. She has been in the ICU since then and has had several complications including acute renal failure, Clostridium difficile infection, lactic acidosis, hypotension, and a low ejection fraction. She is currently on multiple medications and has ongoing issues related to her heart failure, gout, and asthma. She requires further management for her conditions, including weaning off pressors, sedation, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function, as indicated by the increasing serum creatinine levels and low urine output. This may require ongoing renal support and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile and has symptoms of diarrhea. She is currently being treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. Close monitoring for response to treatment and potential complications related to the infection is necessary.

3. Lactic acidosis: The patient has an elevated lactic acid level, which suggests tissue hypoperfusion and poor oxygen delivery. This could be related to her low cardiac output state and may require improvement in her fluid status and cardiac function.

4. Hypotension: The patient is currently on norepine"

   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CT shows a stroke, neuro indicates that [**Doctor Last Name **] stem reflexes are poor.
   Her prognosis is very poor. Husband has arrived from [**State 1771**]. Will
   discuss prognosis and treatment options.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD
   on:[**2132-1-1**] 15:27 ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, hypertension, and severe heart failure. She experienced a VF/VT arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including septic shock secondary to C. diff colitis, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis with bandemia, lactic acidosis, and anemia. She also has a history of gout and asthma.

The patient's current condition is critical, with poor neurological status and organ dysfunction. She requires ongoing intensive care management. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of her renal failure, progression of her liver dysfunction, development of further coagulopathy, worsening of her metabolic acidosis, and potential deterioration in her cardiovascular status.

Given the severity of her condition, it is crucial to closely monitor her vital signs, renal function, liver enzymes, coagulation profile, electrolyte balance, and neurological status. Timely intervention and management of her medical complications are essential to improve her chances of recovery."

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning
   - DP pulses not dopplerable, femoral pulses weak but palpable
   - ABG acidotic, continued on bicarb gtt
   - KUB ordered for more abdominal distention, consistent with early
   toxic megacolon
   - PO vanc increased from 125mg to 500mg Q6h, PR vanc started
   - OGT put on low wall suction
   - repeat KUB showed some improvement
   - surgery consulted, no surgery for now, pending neuro status
   - at about 11:40pm, pt was noted to have anisocoria, right pupil
   (4mm)minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm, concerning for
   herniation
   - vent setting changed to promote hyperventilation, HOB elevated at 30
   degree, mannitol considered but decided against it given renal failure,
   hypotension, acidosis
   - repeat head CT with EEG leads on showed that right sided brain is
   completely edematous, significantly different from one day prior
   - neurosurg contact[**Name (NI) **] but they wanted to have neuro see her first
   - in the morning around 5am, pupils were checked again, equal, 2.5mm
   mimimal-to-no reactivity to light
   - family said that patient would not want to live if neurological
   function is poor, ""not want to live as vegetable""
   - still full code, but husband will fly in tomorrow pm from [**State 1771**], a
   family meeting was proposed for 4pm tomorrow, it would be good to have
   neuro for the meeting

   CT head [**1-1**] (my read): right hemisphere significantly edematous, no
   midline shift. Significantly different from CT head from [**12-30**]
   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. She experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, septic shock secondary to Clostridium difficile (c.diff) colitis, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis with bandemia, lactic acidosis, and rhythm disturbances.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 100/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia and bands, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, elevated creatinine, low hemoglobin, and abnormal coagulation profile.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a significantly edematous right hemisphere on head CT scan, which indicates a possible stroke or brain edema. The K"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levophed on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today
   - trend lytes and renal function daily
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   failure, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be
   secondary to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - can consider give pt IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely as part of the multi-organ failure in septic shock.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**12-31**] to 26.4 secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct daily
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn

   Disposition :  CCU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She experienced a VF/VT arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been on Arctic sun cooling protocol for 18 hours and is off sedation since December 31st morning. 

The patient's current condition includes anisocoria with right pupil minimally reactive to light, indicating a potential herniation. There is also evidence of early toxic megacolon, likely secondary to c-diff infection. The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial, and septic shock, likely secondary to c-diff infection. 

There are several medical complications that can arise in this case:
1. Neurologic Prognosis: The patient's unequal and minimally reactive pupils suggest a poor neurologic prognosis. The repeat head CT with EEG leads on showed significant edema in the right hemisphere, indicating a potential herniation. Further neurologic assessment is needed to determine the patient's prognosis and code status.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.4-1.5, which worsened to 3.3 upon admission. The presence of muddy brown casts and consistent ATN suggests that acute tubular necrosis may be the cause of renal failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration of renal function and may"

# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs

   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion

   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double

","Summary:
- The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertension, and systolic heart failure. She experienced a ventricular tachycardia arrest and was resuscitated.
- She has been diagnosed with irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and a large brain infarct that was embolic. The patient's pupils are fixed and non-reactive to light, indicating a poor prognosis.
- She also has c. difficile colitis, acute renal failure, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis.
- Her liver function tests are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with a bandemia, likely secondary to c. difficile infection and urinary tract infection.
- She has lactic acidosis related to low cardiac output and pressors.
- The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia.
- Her mitral regurgitation is stable.
- She has asthma, but it is currently well-controlled.
- The patient has tophaceous gout on her feet.
- The plan is to withdraw care as there is no realistic expectation that the patient will recover from her brain injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain injury: The patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and a large brain infarct. This may lead to further neurological deterioration and potential death.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.

   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
