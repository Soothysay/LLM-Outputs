   anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulm fibrosis who presents
   s/p 2 episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection who p/w
   unresponsiveness in the setting of new PNA, elevated lactate, fever,
   and elevated WBC.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness: A & Ox3 with exception of actual date (knew month
   and yr). On [**10-21**] and [**10-23**] had acute change in mental status with
   difficulty to arouse. At that time pt had PNA, CT head neg, CTA head
   was normal, EEG was abnormal and neurology thought delirium rather than
   seizure.  However, recent outpt  neuro notes says seizure likely cause
   of episodes of speech arrest.  Today neuro exam does not seem
   significantly changed from prior.  UA was negative. TSH 14 at last
   hospitalization. Finger stick >400 at the time of the incident.
   -etiology most likely in setting of new PNA, elevated WBC, elevated
   lactate
   -consider repeat CT head although unlikely to be + given previous
   similar episode and normal CT head. would not send at this time given
   tenuous respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, osteoporosis, stage IV decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She presented with two episodes of unresponsiveness, which were initially thought to be delirium but later considered as possible seizures. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. She has a history of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida albicans and is being treated with fluconazole. The patient also has a shoulder dislocation that failed closed reduction twice and may require open surgical reduction. She has a history of enterococcus urinary tract infection, chronic normocytic anemia, hypertension, compression fracture/osteoporosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypothyroidism, depression/anxiety, skin ulcers, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent history of aspiration and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
2. Seizures: The patient's episodes of unresponsiveness could be due to seizures, especially considering the abnormal EEG results.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's stage II and unclear"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, Candida albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She presents with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection. Her current condition includes fever, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including unresponsiveness, pneumonia, vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida albicans, shoulder dislocation, urinary tract infection with Enterococcus, chronic normocytic anemia, compression fracture/osteoporosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypothyroidism, depression/anxiety, and skin ulcers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient had episodes of unresponsiveness in the past, which were initially thought to be delirium but recent outpatient neuro notes suggest seizure activity as the likely cause. An MRI head is recommended to evaluate for structural lesions that could produce epilepsy. A neurology consult is also advised.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin/cefepime for pneumonia treatment, with plans to complete the last day of therapy on [2190-11-4]. Additionally, ciprofloxacin has been added for double coverage of Pseudomonas"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, C. albican osteo, stage IV lumbar decubitus, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She presents with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection. The patient is experiencing severe back pain and has dropped oxygen saturation levels to 87%. She was anxious about undergoing an MRI and was rolled, leading to her unstable condition. The decision was made to hold off on the MRI for now and keep the patient overnight for observation, comfort, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient has a history of unresponsiveness episodes, which could be due to delirium or seizures. Further evaluation is needed, including an MRI head, neuro consultation, monitoring on telemetry, and serial neuro exams.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime. Coverage for pseudomonas is being added due to recent hospitalization. Tamiflu is also prescribed for H1N1 coverage, and a nasal swab for flu is planned. A speech and swallow consult is required, and a sputum culture should be done.
3. C. Albicans Vertebral Osteomyelitis: The patient has C. albicans in her vertebral osteomy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, Candida albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus, aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She presents with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection. The patient is currently experiencing unresponsiveness, fever, elevated lactate levels, and an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient has had similar episodes in the past, and today's episode is much longer-lasting. There is a concern for seizure, and a plan for an MRI when the patient is stable was made to evaluate for a structural lesion.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have secondary aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia treatment, but due to recent hospitalization, double coverage for pseudomonas is being considered.
3. Candida Albicans Vertebral Osteomyelitis: A CT-guided biopsy during the last admission revealed C. Albicans in back osteomyelitis. Neurosurgery felt no intervention was needed at the last admission, while ID felt months of antibiotic treatment would be required. Fluconazole is being continued.
4. Shoulder Dislocation: The patient failed closed reduction twice. An orthopedic consult is requested.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -pt was c/o to floor and transport called for MRI. pt was anxious about
   MRI, and was being rolled, in severe back pain.. and dropped sats to
   87% on 3L NC. Patient did not feel comfortable going for MRI and since
   she appeared unstable and MRI was not urgent at the time, we decided to
   hold off on it for now and keep patient overnight for observation/
   comfort/pain control in setting of o2 sats of 87-91% and call her out
   in the AM
   -Found patient to have altered mental status while pre-rounding this
   a.m., responding to sternal rub by briefly opening eyes, then falling
   back asleep. Very difficult to arouse. Vital signs normal. Blood
   glucose 102. ABG 7.42/52/65. Gave Narcan 0.1 mg with immediate

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, Candida albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The patient presents with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection and is currently experiencing prolonged unresponsiveness. She has undergone a neurological work-up in the past, with concern for seizure. The plan was for an MRI today to evaluate for structural lesions, but the patient is not stable enough to leave the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient has had multiple episodes of unresponsiveness, which could be due to various causes such as seizures, infection, or metabolic disturbances. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which may be secondary to her altered mental status and increased risk of aspiration. Antibiotic therapy is ongoing, but the patient may require additional interventions such as airway clearance techniques or mechanical ventilation if her respiratory status worsens.

3. Osteomyelitis: The patient has Candida albicans osteomyelitis, which is a fungal infection of the bone. Long-term antifungal therapy will be necessary to treat this condition.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of altered mental status, non-responsiveness, lumbar compression fracture, c. albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. She presented with unresponsiveness in the setting of fever, elevated WBC and lactate, likely pneumonia. On [10-21] and [10-23], she had acute changes in mental status with difficulty arousing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of altered mental status, lumbar compression fracture, Candida albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypothyroidism, anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. She presented with unresponsiveness and was found to have a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and lactate levels, indicating likely PNA. The patient's recent episodes of unresponsiveness were attributed to narcotics. She has been on methadone, but it has been restarted at a lower dose due to her reactions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 157/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Her neurological exam shows no focal deficits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status/decreased responsiveness: Likely due to narcotics. Methadone restarted yesterday PM, and the patient was minimally responsive this AM; she awoke with low-dose narcan. Future episodes of unresponsiveness likely due to narcotics. Consider Brain MRI in the future.
   - Defer Brain MRI for now given the patient's status.
   - Neurology recommendations: serial neuro exams.
   - Discontinue methadone.
   - Repeat narcan as needed as methadone leaves the system.
   - Recheck TSH.

2. PNA: Possible aspiration. Patient was on vancomycin/cefepime for PNA with a plan for last day of treatment on [**2190-11-4**]. Influenza swab negative.
   - Discontinue tamiflu (influenza swab negative).
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro.
   - Check vancomycin levels.
   - Speech and swallow consult.
   - Sputum gram stain and culture.

3. Candida albicans vertebral osteomyelitis: CT-guided biopsy at last admission revealed C. albicans in the back osteomyelitis. Neurosurgery thought no intervention needed at last admission, and ID felt the patient would need months of antibiotic therapy.
   - TLSO brace at all times if >30 degrees.
   - Log roll precautions.
   - Neurosurgery follow-up.
   - Continue fluconazole.

4. Shoulder dislocation: Patient with failed closed reduction x2.
   - May need open surgical reduction in the future, but this can be addressed after the patient leaves the ICU.

5. Enterococcus urinary tract infection: Currently on treatment with vancomycin for infection during last admission.

6. Chronic normocytic anemia: HCT 26.1, recent baseline 30 to 31.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 77-year-old female patient with a history of altered mental status, lumbar compression fracture, c. albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
- The patient presented with unresponsiveness in the setting of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and lactate levels, likely due to pneumonia.
- She had acute changes in mental status on [10-21] and [10-23] with difficulty arousing, at which time she had pneumonia, but CT head was negative, CTA head was normal, EEG was abnormal, and neurology thought delirium rather than seizure. However, recent outpatient neuro notes say seizure likely cause of episodes of speech arrest.
- The patient's pain was managed with methadone, but she experienced episodes of unresponsiveness, which were likely due to narcotics. Methadone was discontinued.
- The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia, with plans to finish the treatment on [11-4]. Influenza swab was negative, so tamiflu was discontinued.
- She has C. albicans vertebral osteomyelitis, for which neurosurgery thought no intervention was needed, and ID recommended months of antibiotics.
- The patient also has a shoulder dislocation that failed closed reduction twice under general anesthesia, and she may require open"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, C. albicans osteomyelitis, stage IV lumbar decubitus ulcer, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The patient presented with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection and is currently being treated in the ICU.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Unresponsiveness: The patient experienced two episodes of unresponsiveness, which were initially attributed to toxic/metabolic causes possibly related to methadone and gabapentin use. However, the family reported mental status changes after starting fluconazole, suggesting a pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and methadone, resulting in increased methadone levels.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient may have developed aspiration pneumonia, for which she was started on vancomycin and cefepime. The plan is to continue these antibiotics until November 4th, with follow-up sputum cultures.

3. Vertebral Osteomyelitis: The patient has C. albicans vertebral osteomyelitis, as confirmed by a CT-guided biopsy during her last admission.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of lumbar compression fracture, C. albican osteo, stage IV lumbar decub, aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, anemia, unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
- The patient presented with two episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of an infection and was found to have an elevated WBC count, fever, and new pneumonia.
- The unresponsiveness was likely due to toxic/metabolic effects of methadone and gabapentin, with fluconazole potentially increasing methadone levels.
- The patient's mental status improved, and she was taken off the Narcan drip.
- There is low suspicion for seizures.
- Pain and neurology recommendations were followed, including very low-dose Dilaudid for pain relief, restarting citalopram, and monitoring on telemetry and serial neuro exams.
- The patient's mental status changes appear to be more opioid-related than serotonin syndrome-related.
- The patient has a history of C. Albicans vertebral osteomyelitis, for which fluconazole is being continued.
- She also has a shoulder dislocation, enterococcus urinary tract infection, chronic normocytic anemia, compression fracture/osteoporosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypothyroidism, depression/anxiety, and skin ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient experienced two episodes of unresponsiveness, likely due to toxic/metabolic effects of methadone and gabapentin. The mental status changes were observed after starting fluconazole, suggesting a pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and methadone.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a possible secondary pneumonia, which could be due to aspiration. She has been on vancomycin/cefepime for PNA and will continue the treatment until [2190-11-4]. Influenza-negative.

   77 yo f with h/o lumbar compression fracture, c. albican osteo, stage
   IV lumbar decub, aspiration PNA, hypothyroidism, anemia,
   unresponsiveness, and interstitial pulm fibrosis who presents s/p 2
   episodes of unresponsiveness in the setting of infection who p/w
   unresponsiveness in the setting of new PNA, elevated lactate, fever,
   and elevated WBC.

   # Unresponsiveness: Observed episode of unresponsiveness this a.m.
   Patient has had similar episodes in past, but today
s episode is much
   longer-lasting. Has undergone neurologic work-up in past with concern
   for seizure. Plan was for head MRI today to evaluate for structural
   lesion, but currently patient is not stable enough to leave ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP):  Completing course of
   broad spectrum antibiotics.  Stable from a respiratory standpoint.
   Minimal Fi02 requirements.
 OSTEOMYELITIS:  Continues fluconazole.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Secondarry to sedative
   medications, particularly narcotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated in
   seeting of starting fluconazole.  Appreciate pain service input,
   following recommendations.  EEG this morning albeit suspicion now much
   lower for seizure activity. Will cancel MRI, patient would have
   difficulty tolerating given spinal osteo and our suspicion for central
   process is low.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Enterococcus UTI.  Clarify course of
   antibiotics for this.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with unresponsiveness. The patient has been experiencing episodes of unresponsiveness throughout the day, which have been managed with Narcan. The patient also has a history of pneumonia, osteomyelitis, altered mental status, and urinary tract infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 83 bpm with a range of 74-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/72 mmHg to 168/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 12-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is overweight/obese, with cataracts on the right eye and less brisk pupillary response. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and the respiratory examination reveals crackles at the left base. The patient has absent lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status with the ability to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.4 K/uL, thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 544 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 81 to 95 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include pneumonia, osteomyelitis, altered mental status, and urinary tract infection. The patient is completing a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and is stable from a respiratory standpoint. The patient is also being treated with fluconazole for osteomyelitis. The altered mental status is attributed to sedative medications, particularly narcotics, and the patient has been experiencing increased pain since starting fluconazole. The EEG results showed no seizure activity, so an MRI has been canceled. The patient has an enterococcus urinary tract infection, and the course of antibiotics needs to be clarified.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory rate indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infection. These infections may require further treatment or intervention.

3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium, especially considering the use of sedative medications. Monitoring the patient's cognitive function and providing appropriate pain management is crucial.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has risk factors for DVT, such as immobility and altered mental status. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, should be continued.

5. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating the need for close monitoring and appropriate management to maintain glycemic control.

6. Fluid balance: The patient"
