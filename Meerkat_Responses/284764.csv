   can remove the [**Location (un) **] J- collar
   - urine cx with GNRs
   -- overnight had low BP (70/30s); received 500 cc bolus with some
   improvement
   -- started to become hypoxic with sats in the low 80s and maintained,
   even with FiO2 100% still was in the 80s; MV was down to 2-3L and TV
   was 150-200cc. Started to have bradycardia into 20s/30s.  Given 1 mg
   atropine, and started on levophed with another 500 cc LR bolus for
   hypotension into 70s again.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and thoracics were called
   emergently since patient was pericode for concern of airway obstruction
   of trach (PIPs in the 50s on AC).  Bronchoscopy performed with large
   piece of likely granulation tissue obstructing distal portion of trach
   (approx 95% obstruction).  Trach was advanced about 1.5 cm just past
   the obstruction with immediate improvement of O2 sats, MV, and tital
   volumes.  levophed was weaned during the course o the night.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10542] is an 85-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for further management of respiratory failure. She has a history of recent PEs, sCHF (EF 25%), AF, and PVD. She was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure at OSH and underwent tracheostomy with multiple revisions. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with COPD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI), but other toxic/metabolic etiologies should also be considered, such as pneumonia (pna), cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accident (cva), and other metabolic derangements. 
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is likely secondary to COPD and a possible tracheal injury. 
3. Hypotension/sCHF: The patient's hypotension responded to intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. She has a reported ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. 
4. PEs: The patient was recently diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) in the setting of dyspnea. Her INR is supratherapeutic. 
5. C2 fracture: The patient fell on [10-31] and has a C2 fracture. 
6. AFib: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF"

She was admitted to the MICU due to low tidal volumes and has a history of recent pulmonary embolisms, congestive heart failure (EF 25%), atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient required an emergent bronchoscopy overnight due to respiratory distress caused by granulation tissue obstruction in the tracheostomy site. She also has hypotension that responded to intravenous fluid bolus and decreasing requirement of levophed. Her mental status is altered, and there are concerns about urinary tract infection (GNRs). The patient has a history of falls, including a C2 fracture, and is on warfarin for a diagnosed deep vein thrombosis. She has a supratherapeutic INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of granulation tissue suggest potential complications such as pneumonia or further airway obstruction.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's minimally responsive behavior may indicate a possible urinary tract infection (GNRs), metabolic derangement, cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accident, or other toxic etiologies.
3. Hypotension/sCHF: The patient's low blood pressure and evidence of congestive heart failure (EF 25%) indicate the need to monitor for"

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism with traumatic intubation and tracheal laceration. She was admitted for rehabilitation but presented with low tidal volumes and altered mental status in the setting of urinary tract infection (UTI) and distal tracheostomy obstruction by granulation tissue.

The patient experienced acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, followed by hypoxemia and a decrease in minute ventilation to 2-3 liters per minute. She became bradycardic with a heart rate in the 20-30s, and an emergent bronchoscopy showed 95% occlusion of the distal tip of the tracheostomy. The tracheostomy was advanced 1.5 centimeters, resulting in improvement in tidal volumes. She received a total of 1000cc crystalloid and levophed was initiated. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 56, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 175, base excess (-3), oxygen saturation (SaO2) 100%, and respiratory rate (RR) 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's urine culture showed preliminary growth of gram-negative rods. She was on various medications including norepinephrine, lansoprazole, enoxaparin,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism, who was previously admitted for traumatic intubation and tracheal laceration. She returns to the ICU for low tidal volumes and altered mental status due to a urinary tract infection and distal tracheostomy obstruction by granulation tissue.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced acute hypotension with a blood pressure in the 70s, followed by hypoxemia with minimal ventilation. She became bradycardic, and an emergent bronchoscopy showed 95% occlusion of the distal tip of the tracheostomy. The tracheostomy was advanced 1.5 cm, and there was improvement in tidal volumes. She received a total of 1000cc of crystalloid and levophed was initiated. An ABG showed pH 7.25, PaCO2 56, and PaO2 175.
- A urine culture showed preliminary results with gram-negative rods.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10542**] is an 85 year-old woman with resp failure/vent dependent
   s/p trach, recent PEs, sCHF (EF 25%), AF, and PVD who is transferred
   from rehab because of low tidal volumes and is admitted to MICU for
   further management.
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to UTI but would consider
   other toxic/metabolic etiologies including pna (though no infiltrate),
   cardiac ischemia, cva (neg head CT prelim), and other metabolic
   derangements.
   - continue cipro for now
   - low threshold to broaden for resistant organisms given recent
   hospitalizations

   - neg c. diff, CEs
   - f/u urine and blood cx
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  She was intubated for hypercapneic
   respiratory failure at OSH, c/b tracheal injury, and trached here
   requiring multiple revisions.  Also with COPD.  Was tolerating trach
   collar and cpap prior to transfer but lower tidal volumes at rehab.
   Likely secondary to UTI but would consider other toxic/metabolic
   etiologies including pna (though no infiltrate), cardiac ischemia, cva
   (neg head CT prelim), and other metabolic derangements.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - PIPs 20 -> 30

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 93/47-121/55 mmHg, heart rate of 53-82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance at 34.6 cmH2O/mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), increased platelet count (Plt), and normal troponin-T levels. The patient's blood cultures and urinalysis are pending. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and glycemic control is being maintained. Prophyl"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is an 85-year-old woman with respiratory failure, recent pulmonary embolisms, spheric congestive heart failure (EF 25%), atrial flutter, and peripheral vascular disease.
- She was admitted to the MICU for further management due to low tidal volumes and was previously in rehab.
- The patient has a history of traumatic intubation at OSH, which could have led to tracheal injury, and she has been trached here requiring multiple revisions.
- Overnight, the patient experienced respiratory distress, and an emergent bronchoscopy showed large granulation tissue.
- The patient's mental status is altered, and it is unclear if this is a change from her baseline or a result of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Other potential causes like pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or metabolic derangements are also considered.
- The patient's hypotension responded to IV fluid bolus and decreased requirement for vasopressor levophed. She has a reported ejection fraction of 25%.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolisms recently and is on low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox). Coumadin has been held.
- The patient also has a C2 fracture from a fall on October 31st.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name] is an 85-year-old woman with respiratory failure, vent-dependent, s/p tracheostomy, recent pulmonary embolisms, severe congestive heart failure (EF 25%), atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. She was transferred from rehab due to low tidal volumes and admitted to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and traumatic intubation, which may have caused tracheal injury. She required multiple tracheostomy revisions. Her respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy site infection.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's baseline mental status is minimally following commands, and this could be secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI), among other possible causes such as pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or metabolic derangements. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further follow-up of urine and blood cultures is needed.

3. Hypotension/Severe Congestive Heart Failure (sCHF): The patient's hypotension responded to intravenous fluid bolus, indicating volume depletion. Her ejection fraction is reported to be 25%, and she is currently on warfarin. There is a risk of worsening heart"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 10542] is an 85-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for management of acute on chronic respiratory failure, recent PEs, sCHF (EF 25%), AF, and PVD. She has a history of traumatic intubation at OSH causing tracheal injury, COPD, and multiple tracheostomy revisions. She was previously in rehab due to low tidal volumes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has known traumatic intubation at OSH resulting in tracheal injury and tracheostomy placement. She also has COPD. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection with GNR growing in urine. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, but the organism has not been fully speciated yet. There is a risk of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has baseline minimal follow-up commands, which may be due to UTI. Other causes for altered mental status such as pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and metabolic derangements are less likely.

4. Hypotension/Chronic Heart Failure (sCHF): The patient is hypot"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and an unknown origin fever. They are currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being held on a beta-blocker despite having borderline blood pressure. The patient's nutritional status is being managed through tube feeds. They are also receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and suspected UTI, there is a potential risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads to other parts of the body.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating chronic respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if ventilator support is not optimized or if underlying lung pathology worsens.
3. Bleeding Risk: The patient's INR value is elevated, suggesting a higher risk of bleeding. This needs to be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent hemorrhagic complications.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's altered mental status and critical condition may lead to inadequate nutritional intake. Prolonged tube feeding could also result in malnutrition if not properly managed.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates chronic respiratory failure, which could worsen if proper care is not taken.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a suspected UTI, and the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria suggests a resistant infection that may require a change in antibiotic coverage.

3. Pneumonia: The mention of sputum culture pending and CTA (consolidation on chest X-ray) suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, it could lead to further respiratory complications.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is described as altered but improving. It is important to monitor for any signs of delirium or worsening confusion, as this could indicate a decline in neurological function.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of lower extremity edema raises concerns for DVT. Systemic anticoagulation is being provided, but close monitoring for signs of thrombosis or embolism is necessary.

6. Stress ulcers: The patient is on a stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation is essential.

7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), systolic congestive heart failure (sCHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, atrial fibrillation (AF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was transferred from rehabilitation due to low tidal volumes and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for further management.

The patient has had multiple complications, including acute on chronic respiratory failure, urinary tract infection (UTI) with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, altered mental status, congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a C2 fracture.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has known tracheal injury and required tracheostomy. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A bronchoscopy showed a patent tube without any granulation tissue obstructing it, and her respiratory status is stable. There is a question of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given that the patient improved on vancomycin and cefepime despite the presence of ESBL in the urine. Follow-up plans include inhaled albuterol and atrovent, thoracics recommendations, sputum culture, and continuing the 8-day course of mer"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): UTI vs VAP. On
   meropenem, was on vanco and cefepime yesterday with improvement of her
   mental status this is more likely VAP than UTI. She has copious
   secretions noted by RT. Will send sputum culture. Will add back
   vancomycin and treat for 8days total for both UTI/Pneumonia. Will place
   PICC line today.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: tube feeds.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: continue wound care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: will attempt to wean PS and SBT today.
   Will diurese
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): improved on antibiotics.
 H/O CERVICAL FRACTURE (WITHOUT SPINAL CORD INJURY): continue
   C-collar.
hx DVT/PE: resume lovenox therapeutic
low hct: will guiac stool, hemolysis labs wnl, transfuse 1U PRBC.
   minimize phlebotomy.
CHF: wil diurese negative 1L today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin (FUO) likely caused by either urinary tract infection (UTI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on meropenem antibiotics and will continue to be treated for an additional 8 days for both UTI and pneumonia.

The patient also has impaired nutrition due to tube feeds, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status, a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is also experiencing low hemoglobin levels and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the respiratory failure, development of further infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, worsening of the mental status, development of pressure ulcers, and complications related to the DVT/PE history.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection control measures, nutrition, and fluid balance. Regular reassessment of the patient's mental status and skin integrity is also crucial. Close collaboration between the healthcare team members and adherence to the care plan are essential for the patient's well-being."

 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): UTI vs VAP. On
   meropenem, was on vanco and cefepime yesterday with improvement of her
   mental status this is more likely VAP than UTI. She has copious
   secretions noted by RT. Will send sputum culture. Will add back
   vancomycin and treat for 8days total for both UTI/Pneumonia. Will place
   PICC line today.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: tube feeds.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: continue wound care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: will attempt to wean PS and SBT today.
   Will diurese
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): improved on antibiotics.
 H/O CERVICAL FRACTURE (WITHOUT SPINAL CORD INJURY): continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and impaired nutrition. She has a history of cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/48 to 132/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST ventilation. She has been receiving various medications and antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and copious secretions suggest a possible VAP. The ICU team plans to send a sputum culture and add back vancomycin to treat for both urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of DVT/PE indicates a risk for recurrent thrombotic events. She is being resumed on Lovenox therapeutic dose for DVT prophylaxis.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient"

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, recent pulmonary embolisms, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 25%), atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the MICU for further management due to low tidal volumes and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's chief complaint is fever of unknown origin (FUO), along with alterations in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a high fever, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient has impaired nutritional status, which requires attention and intervention.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has poor skin integrity, indicating possible pressure ulcers or other skin breakdown issues. This should be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.

4. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, requiring ongoing management and support with mechanical ventilation.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which has shown improvement with the new antibiotic regimen. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the underlying cause.

6. History of cervical fracture: The patient has a history of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, requiring ongoing assessment and monitoring.

7. History of atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has a known history of AF,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10542] is an 85-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure, s/p tracheostomy, recent pulmonary embolisms, severe congestive heart failure (EF 25%), atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient has a history of traumatic intubation at OSH with a possibility of tracheal injury, multiple tracheostomy revisions, and COPD. She also has an altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI) with ESBL-producing bacteria, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has known traumatic intubation and COPD, which increases the risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheal stenosis.
2. UTI with ESBL-producing Bacteria: The presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in the urine indicates a potential antibiotic-resistant infection, increasing the risk of treatment failure and healthcare-associated infections.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's baseline mental status is impaired, and it is important to identify the underlying cause, which could include delirium, medication effects, or metabolic disturbances.
4. CHF: With an ejection fraction of 25%, the patient is at risk for further decompensation and fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): resolved, VAP +
   UTI, continue meropenem 8days, d/c vancomycin.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: contineu tube feeds.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: continue wound care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: wean vent as tolerated.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): much improved.
 .H/O CERVICAL FRACTURE (WITHOUT SPINAL CORD INJURY): continue
   C-collar.
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB/ CHF: on low dose lopressor, resume
   lisinopril with BP allow. Increase coumadin. continue lovenox. Resume
   home lasix, and give one dose of iv lasi.
 PE/DVT: continue lovenox.
Anemia: no clear bleeding source, continue to follow much improved s/p
   IUPRBC, likely 2.2 to phelbotomy and anemia of chronic disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing fever with unknown origin, which has been resolved and is believed to be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's nutrition is being addressed through tube feeds.
- There is an alteration in skin integrity, and wound care is being continued.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and weaning from the ventilator is being attempted as tolerated.
- The patient had an altered mental status but has shown significant improvement.
- The patient has a history of a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, and a cervical collar is being continued.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, for which low-dose lopressor is being administered, along with resumption of lisinopril with blood pressure allowance. Coumadin dosage is being increased, and lovenox is being continued. Home lasix is also being resumed, and a single dose of IV lasi is given.
- The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, and lovenox is being continued for prophylaxis.
- Anemia is present but with no clear bleeding source. The patient is being monitored for improvement post-intrauterine packed red blood cell transfusion, likely due to phlebotomy and anemia of chronic disease.
