   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome. He has encephalopathy with rising MELD/INR, likely precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is on the active transplant list. 

The patient's current medical issues include decompenstated hep C cirrhosis, renal failure due to hepato-renal syndrome, thrombocytopenia/anemia, SBP, hypotension, and fluid shifts during hemodialysis. 

The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, decreased albumin, low calcium levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (PT/INR). The patient's blood counts reveal thrombocytopenia and anemia. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, midodrine and octreotide for variceal bleeding prophylaxis, monitoring of LFTs, INR, and albumin levels. For renal failure, the patient will start continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to hypotension and intolerance to hemodialysis. 

The patient also requires monitoring of blood counts daily and transfusion for hematocrit (HCT) <21 and platelets (Plts) <20. SBP prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin should continue, and follow-up cultures from recent paracentesis should be monitored. Hypotension management involves CVVH for now, and fluid shifts during hemodialysis should be closely monitored. 

The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines (dialysis catheter, PICC line, arterial line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), code status, and disposition are also noted."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has a history of decompenstated HCV cirrhosis with encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR likely precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by hepato-renal syndrome. He is on an active transplant list and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepato-renal syndrome: This condition is characterized by kidney failure in patients with advanced liver disease. It can worsen the patient's renal function and may require ongoing CVVH.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to fluid shifts during hemodialysis or underlying liver and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and anemia (low red blood cell count), which may be related to underlying liver disease or congestive sequestration. Regular monitoring of blood counts is important, and transfusion may be required if the counts drop below certain thresholds.
4. SBP recurrence: Although the patient's recent SBP episode has resolved, there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). He has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and completed a course of antibiotics. The patient's current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, and sevelamer. He is also on prophylactic ciprofloxacin for SBP.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hep C Cirrhosis: Decompensated with encephalopathy and rising Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)/International Normalized Ratio (INR); likely precipitated by SBP possibly resulting in hepatorenal syndrome. No evidence of recurrence on the most recent paracentesis.
   - Confirm with hepatology service that patient is active on the transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin.
   - Continue midodrine; discontinue octreotide.
   - Trend liver function tests (LFTs), INR, and albumin levels.
   - Provide sarna and ursiol for pruritus.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis and monitor fever curve and white blood cell count. Consider repeat paracentesis if indicated.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and is experiencing ongoing tachycardia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of vital signs, fluid balance, and multiple organ functions. The patient is receiving various interventions including vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy, and antibiotic therapy for suspected infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to multi-organ dysfunction and the presence of indwelling lines increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Renal failure: The patient's hepatorenal syndrome indicates compromised renal function. Continued monitoring of renal parameters and ongoing renal replacement therapy will be necessary to manage this complication.

3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's abnormal systolic flow contour and mitral regurgitation suggest cardiac dysfunction. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and optimization of cardiovascular support are required to maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of a small perihepatic free fluid on imaging raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and laboratory parameters, especially coagulation profile, is essential to detect and manage any bleeding episodes.

5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's small bilateral pleural eff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepatorenal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension (not in shock), hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia/anemia, and resolved spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has a history of decompenstated Hep C cirrhosis with encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR, likely precipitated by SBP complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is currently on lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and low albumin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 78/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potential organ damage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including leukocytosis, renal failure, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepato-renal syndrome: This condition occurs in advanced liver disease and is characterized by acute kidney injury. The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and CVVH is being continued.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection, and SBP is a common complication in cirrhotic patients. Prophylactic antibiotics are being given, and a repeat paracentesis may be considered if there is decompensation or rising WBC count.
3. Hepatitis C-related complications: The patient has decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Monitoring of liver function tests and close follow-up are necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia and anemia: The patient has low platelet and hemoglobin levels due to congestive sequestration and underlying liver disease. Monitoring of blood counts daily and appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, renal failure, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and potential recurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is also on various medications and treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepato-renal syndrome: This is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis that leads to kidney failure. The patient requires CVVH due to an inability to tolerate hemodialysis (HD) because of hypotension.
2. Recurrent SBP: The patient has leukocytosis and is on prophylactic antibiotics. There is concern for recurrence of SBP, which can lead to worsening hepato-renal syndrome and sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia and anemia: These conditions are likely due to underlying liver disease and congestive sequestration. Monitoring of platelet and red blood cell counts is necessary, with transfusion considered if counts drop below certain thresholds.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires midodrine to maintain blood pressure. Fluid shifts during HD may contribute to hypotension.
5. Pulmonary complications: Although not mentioned in the note, the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented from the floor with ongoing hepatorenal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia/anemia, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's condition is being managed with multiple medications and treatments, including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, sevelamer, and ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. The patient is also receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and has prophylactic measures in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU pending liver/renal transplant or ability to tolerate hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypotension, which may be due to fluid shifts during hemodialysis or underlying liver disease. Monitoring the patient's hemodynamics closely and adjusting treatments accordingly will be important to manage this complication.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has developed hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure that occurs in the setting of advanced liver disease. CVVH is being used to manage this condition,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. They have been experiencing increased white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and are showing signs of worsening hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring vasopressor support. They have a history of chronic pain and acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and acute kidney injury. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function tests show abnormalities. They are receiving renal nutrition and have multiple lines placed for dialysis and arterial access. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been started on heparin prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's worsening hepatorenal syndrome suggests progressive kidney dysfunction due to liver disease. This condition requires immediate attention and management to prevent further deterioration.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Proper skin care and repositioning should be implemented to prevent complications.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain management in the setting of critical illness can be challenging. Appropriate analgesia should be provided to ensure comfort and prevent pain-induced complications.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including chronic liver disease, hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. The patient has been receiving various treatments such as vasopressin, norepinephrine, octreotide, heparin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

24-hour events include an increase in white blood cell count with one band, discontinuation of octreotide, initiation of subcutaneous heparin, worsening appearance with leukocytosis leading to broadened antibiotic coverage, refusal of paracentesis by the patient's sisters and healthcare proxy, and titration of vasoactive medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 78/48 to 101/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 8,605 mL and output of 7,859 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 746 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice with multiple ecchymoses, sclera icteric, dry mucous membranes, supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, distended abdomen, and pitting edema to the waist.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented from the floor with ongoing hepatorenal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). The patient's medical history includes a recent episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) for which he completed an antibiotic course but now shows signs of leukocytosis, suggesting a possible recurrence. His current condition includes hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's liver disease has led to kidney failure, known as hepatorenal syndrome. This condition requires CVVH to manage the renal failure.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) Recurrence: The patient's leukocytosis indicates a possible recurrence of SBP. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of infection and consider repeating paracentesis to prevent further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to fluid shifts during hemodialysis or underlying liver disease. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is essential, and adjustments in fluid management and vasopressor support may be necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient's low platelet count and hemoglobin levels may be due to congestive sequestration or underlying liver disease. Regular monitoring of blood counts is necessary, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis with encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR, likely precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. The family has refused diagnostic paracentesis.

2. Leukocytosis with an increased white blood cell count. The source of infection is unclear, but SBP is a likely source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been empirically started.

3. Renal failure due to hepato-renal syndrome. The patient has been on CVVH in the past but is currently unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension.

4. Hypotension, which is likely related to fluid shifts during hemodialysis. The patient's blood pressure has been trending down, requiring the addition of vasopressin. Levophed has been weaned to 0.2.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M ESLD, ESRD, chronic low blood pressure admitted for CVVH and
   pressor support while awaiting liver / kidney transplant. WBC 12K, BP
   down, now on levo and vasopressin. Family has declined paracentesis,
   abx broadened to vanco / zosyn / cipro, xfused one unit PRBCs.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2 BP 85/50 HR 80-100 RR 18 with sat 99 on 2LNC.
   Markedly icteric man, NAD. Answers simple questions, c/o mild abd pain.

   22, K+ 4.2, Cr 5.5, INR 3.1, t. bili 44.
   Agree with plan to manage ESLD / ESRD with lactulose and rifaximin for
   encephalopathy, midodrine for HRS / ARF, and CVVH with vasopressor
   support for ongoing hypotension; goal TBB even. Pan cultured yesterday,
   will continue broad antibiotic coverage, check CXR, and d/w family re
   role of paracentesis and overall plan of care. Will continue to discuss
   management with liver transplant and surgery. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Able to run net even yesterday on CVVH but still
   requiring double pressor support. On broad antibiotic coverage due to
   concern for sepsis with increasing leukocytosis.
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin with goal to wean
   pressors; would like to run negative if able
   - Cont vanc/zosyn (D3) and cipro (D2 tx dose)
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but reconsider if clinical status
   worsening on empiric abx treatment.
   - Panculture if spikes
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve; add diff to AM labs
   - Check C. diff as not covering currently
   - Rediscuss with GI and family need for diagnostic paracentesis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis and LFTs on broadened abx with neg cx to
   date.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Goal negative fluid balance if able to wean pressors
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer; d/c octreotide
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Has been stable.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. He is currently in the ICU due to ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure (hepato-renal syndrome), thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring double pressor support. The goal is to wean off pressors and continue CVVH with midodrine, levophed, and vasopressin.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has an infection, possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. A paracentesis is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Hep C Cirrhosis: The patient's condition has worsened, leading to encephalopathy and a rising Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and International Normalized Ratio (INR). This may be precipitated by SBP and potentially hepatorenal syndrome. Liver transplantation is not currently an option due to the presence of SBP and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Able to run net even yesterday on CVVH but still
   requiring double pressor support. On broad antibiotic coverage due to
   concern for sepsis with increasing leukocytosis.
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin with goal to wean
   pressors; would like to run negative if able
   - Cont vanc/zosyn (D3) and cipro (D2 tx dose)
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but reconsider if clinical status
   worsening on empiric abx treatment.
   - Panculture if spikes
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve; add diff to AM labs
   - Check C. diff as not covering currently
   - Rediscuss with GI and family need for diagnostic paracentesis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis and LFTs on broadened abx with neg cx to
   date likely from SBP.
   - D/W family transplant options with liver team today because may never
   be well enough to have transplant
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro ->may consider anti-fungals if pressor
   requirement increases, fevers, decompensation
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Goal negative fluid balance if able to wean pressors
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer; d/c octreotide
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Has been stable.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - Transfuse for Hct <21, Plts<20

The patient has hypotension and is still requiring double pressor support. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated due to concern for sepsis, with increasing leukocytosis. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Hypotension: The patient is being continued on midodrine, levophed, and vasopressin, with the goal to wean off pressors. Negative fluid balance is desired if possible.
2) Leukocytosis: The patient is likely unable to mount a temperature response with CVVH. No clear source of infection is identified, but spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) would be the most likely source. Family refused paracentesis two days ago but reconsidered if clinical status worsens on empiric antibiotic treatment. A panculture will be done if spikes occur, and the WBC count and fever curve will be trended. Differential will be added to the morning labs, and C. difficile will be checked as it is not currently covered. Rediscuss with the GI team and family the need for diagnostic paracentesis. Continue vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for now.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and ESRD (end-stage renal disease) admitted for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and pressor support while awaiting liver/kidney transplant. He is currently on vasopressin and levo. The family has declined paracentesis, so broadened antibiotic coverage has been empirically started. His exam is notable for jaundice, dry mucous membranes, sclera icteric, and distended abdomen with pitting edema. His labs show elevated total bilirubin, low albumin, elevated creatinine, and prolonged INR.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension requiring double pressor support, hepatic cirrhosis with encephalopathy, leukocytosis, renal failure, thrombocytopenia/anemia, and congestive sequestration.

The assessment and plan include managing ESLD/ESRD with lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, midodrine for HRS/ARF, and CVVH with vasopressor support for ongoing hypotension; goal TBB even. Pan cultured yesterday, will continue broad antibiotic coverage, check CXR, and discuss management with liver transplant and surgery. The patient will continue to be discussed in the liver team meeting.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension leading to multi-organ dysfunction, development"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's condition is complicated by hepato-renal syndrome, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently requiring double pressor support to maintain blood pressure. Continued monitoring and adjustment of the pressors will be necessary to prevent further hypotension and ensure adequate organ perfusion.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's increasing white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the source of infection remains unclear. There is a concern for SBP, which would require further evaluation and management, including potential diagnostic paracentesis.
3. Elevated LFTs: The patient's rising liver enzymes indicate ongoing liver damage. Decompensation of liver function can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and worsening of other complications associated with cirrhosis.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's renal function is compromised due to the hepato-renal syndrome. CVVH is being continued to manage renal failure, but careful monitoring"

   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with

   #) Hypotension
 Worse today with CVVH running only even overnight and
   pressor requirement increasing. On broad antibiotic coverage due to
   concern for sepsis with increasing leukocytosis.
   - Transfuse one unit today for slight drop in hct and pressure
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo
   if BPs not up with blood
   - Cont vanc/zosyn (D4) and cipro (D3 tx dose)
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but now agreeable and if cultures
   grew fungus would add anti-fungal so could do diagnostic para today if
   continues to have hypotension.
   - Panculture if spikes although may not mount temp given CVVH
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve;
   - F/U C. diff as not covering currently
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now and consider anti-fungal if ctes to
   have hypotension.
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro ->may consider anti-fungals if pressor
   requirement increases, fevers, decompensation
   #) Left Leg Swelling: Concerning for DVT given immobility.
   - Lenis ordered for this morning
   - Had to hold hep sc given elevated ptt this am. Will put pneumoboot on
   one arm for DVT ppx for now.
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer; d/c octreotide
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Hct slightly lower today and BPs lower so getting 2
   units.
   - Check hct post-transfusion
   - Transfuse for Hct <25, Plts<20

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient's hypotension worsened today despite CVVH running overnight and increased pressor requirement. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated due to concern for sepsis, as indicated by increasing leukocytosis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/41 to 116/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but does not require supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals jaundice, dry mucous membranes, distended abdomen with tender hepatomegaly, and edema bilaterally to the sacrum. Neurological examination shows encephalopathy with the patient oriented only to person.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low albumin level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

The patient has a history of hypotension, which is not due to shock. The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, requiring the use of norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain adequate blood pressure. 

The patient also has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, arousal, attention, and cognition. This suggests potential neurological impairment or dysfunction.

There are concerns regarding the patient's balance, gait, joint mobility, motor function, muscle performance, sensory integrity, transfers, pain control (both acute and chronic), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient is diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of liver disease.

The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral nutrition using Nutren Renal (Full) at 45 mL/hour.

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a dialysis catheter, PICC line, and arterial line.

Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition appears complex, involving multiple organ systems and requiring intensive care management."

   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Able to run net even yesterday on CVVH but still
   requiring double pressor support. On broad antibiotic coverage due to
   concern for sepsis with increasing leukocytosis.
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin with goal to wean
   pressors; would like to run negative if able
   - Cont vanc/zosyn (D3) and cipro (D2 tx dose)
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but reconsider if clinical status
   worsening on empiric abx treatment.
   - Panculture if spikes
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve; add diff to AM labs
   - Check C. diff as not covering currently
   - Rediscuss with GI and family need for diagnostic paracentesis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis and LFTs on broadened abx with neg cx to
   date likely from SBP.
   - D/W family transplant options with liver team today because may never
   be well enough to have transplant
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro ->may consider anti-fungals if pressor
   requirement increases, fevers, decompensation
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Goal negative fluid balance if able to wean pressors
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer; d/c octreotide
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia - [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Has been stable.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - Transfuse for Hct <21, Plts<20

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient is hypotensive and requiring double pressor support. Antibiotic coverage has been initiated due to concern for sepsis with increasing leukocytosis. The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to CVVH and there is no clear source of infection, but spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) would be the most likely source. The family initially refused diagnostic paracentesis, but reconsidered if the clinical status worsens on empiric antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures are being monitored and the patient's temperature curve is being trended. The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is worsening and his MELD score is rising. He has hepato-renal syndrome and is currently not able to undergo transplantation due to the question of SBP and unstable medical condition. The patient's renal failure is due to hepato-renal syndrome and he has been on CVVH in the past but unable to tolerate hemodialysis (HD). Thrombocytopenia and anemia are present, likely due to congestive sequestration and underlying liver disease. The patient's current ICU care includes CVVH, pressor support, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and nutritional support.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Worse today with CVVH running only even overnight and
   pressor requirement increasing. Hct drop and enlarging left thigh
   concerning for bleed with underlying coagulopathy/platelet dysfunction.
   On broad antibiotic coverage due to concern for sepsis with increasing
   leukocytosis.
   - Heparin SC discontinued
   - Transfuse one unit today for slight drop in hct and pressure; 2 units
   FFP for presumed bleed
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo
   if BPs not up with blood
   - Cont empiric vanc/zosyn (D4), cipro (D3 tx dose)
   - Will ask ID for rec re: antifungal coverage with least hepatotoxicity
   - Paracentesis may be less useful in setting of declining clinical
   status; pending goals of care discussion w/ family this PM
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but now agreeable and if cultures
   grew fungus would add anti-fungal so could do diagnostic para today if
   continues to have hypotension.
   - Panculture if spikes although may not mount temp given CVVH
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve;
   - F/U C. diff as not covering currently
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now; antifungal and paracentesis plan
   as above
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - Family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro; considering antifungals as above
   - Holding paracentesis for now as above
   #) Left Leg Swelling: Concerning for DVT v. bleeding into LLE.
   - LENIs ordered for this morning
   - Ordered for 1U pRBC, 2 units FFP
   - Holding hep sc given elevated PTT and question of bleed. Will put
   pneumoboot on one arm for DVT ppx for now.
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Hct slightly lower today and BPs lower so getting 2
   units as well as FFP for suspected bleed into LLE.
   - Check Hct post-transfusion
   - Transfuse for Hct <25, Plts<20

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient's condition has worsened, with hypotension, leukocytosis, and signs of bleeding in the left thigh. There are also concerns about a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 85/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is also tachycardic and has dry mucous membranes.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin concentration, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage due to concerns for sepsis. There are plans to perform a paracentesis, obtain cultures, and discuss goals of care with the family. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management in the ICU."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. He is also on broad antibiotic coverage due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and fungal infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, dry mucous membranes, mild crackles in the right lung field, distended abdomen with tender hepatomegaly, bilateral lower extremity edema, and left calf swelling with blistering, hyperpigmentation, and oozing yellow fluid. He is encephalopathic but oriented to person and place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

   request. On broad antibiotic coverage with GPC in pairs and chains from
   1 of 2 sets bcx from [**4-29**]. Appropriate bump in Hct s/p 1 unit pRBC and
   2 units FFP yesterday due to concern for bleed into enlarged left thigh
   given underlying coagulopathy/platelet dysfunction.
   - Cont broad empiric coverage with Dapto (D2), zosyn (D5), cipro (D4 tx
   dose), micafungin (D2)
   - Cont midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo if BPs not
   up with blood
   - Heparin SC discontinued
   #) Leukocytosis: Cont to increase. Patient likely unable to mount
   temperature with CVVH. SBP most likely source; treating empirically
   with broad abx including antifungal as family refused paracentesis
   several days ago.  1 of 2 sets [**4-29**] bcx with GPCs. C. diff neg.
   - Panculture if spikes although may not mount temp given CVVH
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro/mica
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - Family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro; considering antifungals as above
   - Holding paracentesis for now as above
   #) Left>Right Leg Swelling: No DVT. Concern for bleeding but Hct bumped
   appropriately to 1 unit yesterday.
   - Pneumoboot on one arm and off heparin SC for DVT ppx given concern
   for bleed
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. CVVH held yesterday per
   family request. Cr increased but K stable.
   - Per renal recs, dialysis not indicated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented to the ICU with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic cirrhosis with encephalopathy, left leg swelling without deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and renal failure due to hepato-renal syndrome. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring two pressors despite being off CVVH per family request. This indicates ongoing instability in blood pressure control.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, suggesting a possible infection, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis.
3. Hepatic Cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease is worsening, as evidenced by rising MELD/INR scores and worsening liver function tests (LFTs). This could lead to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Left Leg Swelling: While there is no evidence of DVT, the swelling in the left leg raises concerns for bleeding, especially given the patient's coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, left leg swelling without deep vein thrombosis, and renal failure. The patient is on broad antibiotic coverage for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and fungal infection, and is also being treated for potential Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring two pressors despite being off CVVH per family request. This indicates ongoing issues with maintaining stable blood pressure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs of impaired mental function due to liver dysfunction.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has rising liver enzymes and an elevated MELD score, indicating worsening liver function.
5. Left Leg Swelling: The patient has swelling in the left leg, which is concerning for potential bleeding rather than a deep vein thrombosis.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has hepato-renal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure secondary to liver disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Worse today with CVVH running only even overnight and
   pressor requirement increasing. Hct drop and enlarging left thigh
   concerning for bleed with underlying coagulopathy/platelet dysfunction.
   On broad antibiotic coverage due to concern for sepsis with increasing
   leukocytosis.
   - Heparin SC discontinued
   - Transfuse one unit today for slight drop in hct and pressure; 2 units
   FFP for presumed bleed
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo
   if BPs not up with blood
   - Cont empiric vanc/zosyn (D4), cipro (D3 tx dose)
   - Will ask ID for rec re: antifungal coverage with least hepatotoxicity
   - Paracentesis may be less useful in setting of declining clinical
   status; pending goals of care discussion w/ family this PM
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but now agreeable and if cultures
   grew fungus would add anti-fungal so could do diagnostic para today if
   continues to have hypotension.
   - Panculture if spikes although may not mount temp given CVVH
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve;
   - F/U C. diff as not covering currently
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now; antifungal and paracentesis plan
   as above
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - Family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro; considering antifungals as above
   - Holding paracentesis for now as above
   #) Left Leg Swelling: Concerning for DVT v. bleeding into LLE.
   - LENIs ordered for this morning
   - Ordered for 1U pRBC, 2 units FFP
   - Holding hep sc given elevated PTT and question of bleed. Will put
   pneumoboot on one arm for DVT ppx for now.
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Hct slightly lower today and BPs lower so getting 2
   units as well as FFP for suspected bleed into LLE.
   - Check Hct post-transfusion
   - Transfuse for Hct <25, Plts<20

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient has a history of bleeding, including a recent episode with left thigh swelling and a suspected bleed. He also has leukocytosis and is on broad antibiotic coverage due to concern for sepsis. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, indicating worsening hepatic function. There is concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) versus bleeding into the left lower extremity (LLE). The patient's renal function is also compromised, with a diagnosis of hepato-renal syndrome. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is on broad antibiotic coverage due to concern for sepsis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. If not properly managed, this could lead to septic shock.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing worsening encephalopathy, which could further deteriorate his mental status and lead to increased risk of falls and other complications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by the elevated prothrombin time (PTT) and low platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension
 Worse today with CVVH running only even overnight and
   pressor requirement increasing. Hct drop and enlarging left thigh
   concerning for bleed with underlying coagulopathy/platelet dysfunction.
   On broad antibiotic coverage due to concern for sepsis with increasing
   leukocytosis.
   - Heparin SC discontinued
   - Transfuse one unit today for slight drop in hct and pressure; 2 units
   FFP for presumed bleed
   - Cont CVVH with midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo
   if BPs not up with blood
   - Cont empiric vanc/zosyn (D4), cipro (D3 tx dose)
   - Will ask ID for rec re: antifungal coverage with least hepatotoxicity
   - Paracentesis may be less useful in setting of declining clinical
   status; pending goals of care discussion w/ family this PM
   #) Leukocytosis: Increasing. Patient likely unable to mount temperature
   with CVVH. No clear source of infection but SBP would be likeliest
   source. Family refused 2 days ago but now agreeable and if cultures
   grew fungus would add anti-fungal so could do diagnostic para today if
   continues to have hypotension.
   - Panculture if spikes although may not mount temp given CVVH
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve;
   - F/U C. diff as not covering currently
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro for now; antifungal and paracentesis plan
   as above
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - Family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Trend LFTs, INR, albumin
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/cipro; considering antifungals as above
   - Holding paracentesis for now as above
   #) Left Leg Swelling: Concerning for DVT v. bleeding into LLE.
   - LENIs ordered for this morning
   - Ordered for 1U pRBC, 2 units FFP
   - Holding hep sc given elevated PTT and question of bleed. Will put
   pneumoboot on one arm for DVT ppx for now.
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Has been on CVVH in past,
   now unable to tolerate HD [**12-21**] hypotension
   - Cont CVVH; will watch hemodynamics closely
   - Cont midodrine, selevamer
   - F/u renal recs
   #) Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: [**12-21**] congestive sequestration, underlying
   liver disease. Hct slightly lower today and BPs lower so getting 2
   units as well as FFP for suspected bleed into LLE.
   - Check Hct post-transfusion
   - Transfuse for Hct <25, Plts<20

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been worsening despite CVVH and increasing pressor requirements. This indicates potential inadequate perfusion and organ hypoxia.

2. Bleeding: There is concern for a possible bleed due to the drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and platelet dysfunction. The patient has received a blood transfusion and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for presumed bleeding.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increasing white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. The most likely source of infection is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and the family has agreed to perform paracentesis if cultures grow fungus.

4. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient's hepatic function is deteriorating, as evidenced by rising liver enzymes (LFTs), INR, and worsening encephalopathy. This indicates a decline in liver function and potential hepatorenal syndrome.

5. Left leg swelling: The patient has swelling in the left leg, which could be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or bleeding into the lower extremity (LLE"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), and a slightly elevated body temperature. The patient is also experiencing impaired mental status and encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including ESLD (end-stage liver disease), ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and is not a transplant candidate. This suggests that the patient may have chronic liver and kidney dysfunction.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), anasarca (generalized swelling), muscle wasting, and extensive skin breakdown with purulent areas. These findings indicate poor nutritional status and compromised skin integrity.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/INR), and signs of renal impairment (elevated creatinine and BUN). The patient also has hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia).

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, and various antibiotics. The patient is receiving IV fluids, nutritional support, and has an arterial line, central venous catheter, and dialysis catheter in place.

Overall, the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), sepsis, and multi-drug resistant (MDR) yeast infection. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of his critical condition. The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. He is on vasopressor and norepinephrine infusions. The patient's renal function is compromised, and dialysis is not indicated at this time. There is a concern about the potential development of renal failure. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. There is evidence of respiratory distress with mild rales in the right lung field. The patient's neurological status is altered, and he is encephalopathic. He has swelling and blistering in the left thigh and calf, with hyperpigmentation and oozing of yellow fluid from the heel. These findings suggest the possibility of severe peripheral vascular disease. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, indicating poor glycemic control. The patient has a history of MDR yeast infection, and there is evidence of budding yeast growing from the arterial line despite receiving antifungal medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's compromised renal function and the decision against dialysis suggest a potential risk of renal failure.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes indicate possible liver dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.
3. Respiratory distress: The presence of mild rales in the right lung field may indicate the development of respiratory distress or pneumonia.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: Swelling, blistering, and oozing of yellow fluid from the heel suggest severe peripheral vascular disease, which can lead to complications such as gangrene or limb ischemia.
5. Hyperglycemia: Consistently high blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, increasing the risk of diabetic complications.
6. MDR yeast infection: The presence of budding yeast from the arterial line despite antifungal medication suggests the potential for further spread or complications related to the MDR yeast infection.

Please note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the progress note, and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition should be conducted by a healthcare professional."

   #) Hypotension: Still on 2 pressors despite being off CVVH per family
   request. On broad antibiotic coverage with GPC in pairs and chains from
   1 of 2 sets bcx from [**4-29**]. Appropriate bump in Hct s/p 1 unit pRBC and
   2 units FFP yesterday due to concern for bleed into enlarged left thigh
   given underlying coagulopathy/platelet dysfunction.
   - Cont broad empiric coverage with Dapto (D2), zosyn (D5), cipro (D4 tx
   dose), micafungin (D2)
   - Cont midodrine, levophed, vasopressin. Consider adding neo if BPs not
   up with blood
   - Heparin SC discontinued
   - Renal states dialysis is not indicated.
   - Family meeting today to re-address goals of care now that dialysis is
   not indicated.
   #) Leukocytosis: Cont to increase. Patient likely unable to mount
   temperature with CVVH. SBP most likely source; treating empirically
   with broad abx including antifungal as family refused paracentesis
   several days ago.  1 of 2 sets [**4-29**] bcx with GPCs. C. diff neg.

   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given question of SBP and unstable medical
   condition. Rising leukocytosis, worsening encephalopathy, and LFTs with
   worsening coagulation tests suggest worsening hepatic function.
   - Family meeting with liver team and transplant today at 4pm
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome. He requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic failure, left thigh swelling, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient is on broad empiric antibiotic coverage, including antifungal agents, due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Dialysis is not indicated in this case. The family has requested to stop pressors and has expressed concerns about the patient's goals of care. A family meeting was held to discuss these concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still on two pressors despite being off CVVH per family request. This indicates ongoing hypotension, which can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential shock.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. In the context of suspected SBP, this could indicate worsening infection.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver dysfunction. This can lead to confusion, disorientation, and potentially coma if not managed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic cirrhosis, left leg swelling, renal failure, and fungemia caused by budding yeast in the blood culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still on two pressors despite being off CVVH per family request. The continued use of pressor support indicates ongoing instability in blood pressure, which can lead to complications such as organ hypoperfusion and ischemia.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, suggesting an ongoing infection. The presence of budding yeast in the blood culture indicates a fungal infection, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Hepatic Cirrhosis: The patient's decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis has resulted in hepato-renal syndrome. This condition can lead to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
4. Left Leg Swelling: The patient has swelling in the left leg, which could be a sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other vascular issues. This needs to be evaluated to prevent potential complications like pulmonary embolism.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension: Still on 2 pressors despite being off CVVH per family
   request. Now fungemic with budding yeast in blood cx.
   - Cont broad empiric coverage with Dapto (D3), zosyn (D6), cipro (D5 tx
   dose), micafungin (D3)
   - Renal stated dialysis is not indicated as his underlying hepatic
   disease cannot be treated with transplant.
   - His family was made aware that dialysis is not indicated and he will
   receive last rights, his mother will come visit him and he will be made
   CMO.
   #) Leukocytosis: Cont to increase. Patient likely unable to mount
   temperature with CVVH. Blood Cx growing budding yeast
   - f/u cultures.
   - Continue dapto /mica
   - Consider d/c zosyn/cipro as only treating empirically.
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given clinical status
   - Family meeting with liver team has indicated he will get last rights
   today and will be made CMO after.
   - D/c lactulose as CMO
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   #) Left>Right Leg Swelling: No DVT. Initially concerned for bleeding
   but hcts stable.
   - Off heparin SQ
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Per renal, dialysis not
   indicated. D/C phos binders as no longer checking labs.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: Despite being off CVVH per family request, the patient remains on 2 pressors. The family has been made aware that dialysis is not indicated due to the underlying hepatic disease being unable to be treated with transplant. The patient will receive last rights, and his mother will come visit before pressors are stopped.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing. The blood culture is growing budding yeast, indicating a fungal infection. Empiric antifungal coverage with micafungin has been started. cultures will be followed up, and consideration will be given to discontinuing zosyn/cipro as they are only being used empirically.

3. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR. This is likely precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. Due to the patient's clinical status, he is currently not able to be trans"

   55M with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presents from floor with
   ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring CVVH and pressor support.
   #) Hypotension: Still on 2 pressors despite being off CVVH per family
   request. Now fungemic with budding yeast in blood cx.
   - Cont broad empiric coverage with Dapto (D3), zosyn (D6), cipro (D5 tx
   dose), micafungin (D3)
   - Renal stated dialysis is not indicated as his underlying hepatic
   disease cannot be treated with transplant.
   - His family was made aware that dialysis is not indicated and he will
   receive last rights, his mother will come visit him and he will be made
   CMO.
   #) Leukocytosis: Cont to increase. Patient likely unable to mount
   temperature with CVVH. Blood Cx growing budding yeast
   - f/u cultures.
   - Continue dapto /mica
   - Consider d/c zosyn/cipro as only treating empirically.
   #) Hep C Cirrhosis:  Decompensated w/ encepholpathy & rising MELD/INR;
   likely precipitated by SBP c/b hepatorenal syndrome. Currently not able
   to be transplanted given clinical status
   - Family meeting with liver team has indicated he will get last rights
   today and will be made CMO after.
   - D/c lactulose as CMO
   - Sarna and urosidiol for pruritis
   #) Left>Right Leg Swelling: No DVT. Initially concerned for bleeding
   but hcts stable.
   - Off heparin SQ
   #) Renal failure: [**12-21**] hepato-renal syndrome. Per renal, dialysis not
   indicated. D/C phos binders as no longer checking labs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis presenting from the floor with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite being off CVVH per family request. He is still on 2 pressors. This could indicate poor cardiac output or significant fluid loss.

2. Fungemia: The patient has developed a fungal infection, as evidenced by the presence of budding yeast in the blood culture. This suggests a systemic fungal infection, which needs to be treated with appropriate antifungal medications.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. The presence of budding yeast in the blood culture supports the diagnosis of fungemia.

4. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated liver disease due to hepatitis C, resulting in encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR scores. This suggests advanced liver failure with impaired liver function.

5. Left>Right Leg Swelling: The patient has swelling in the lower extremities, but there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the initial concern for bleeding has been ruled out as the hematocrit (Hct)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and pressor support. He has hypotension despite being on two pressors, and his blood culture is growing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He is also fungemic with budding yeast in his blood culture. The patient has renal failure due to hepato-renal syndrome, leukocytosis, hepatic cirrhosis with encephalopathy, and left leg swelling without deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition is deteriorating, and he is not currently eligible for a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite pressor support indicates a potential complication related to cardiovascular dysfunction or sepsis.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's renal failure secondary to hepato-renal syndrome poses a significant risk for further deterioration in kidney function.
3. Infection: The presence of VRE and fungemia suggests a serious infection that needs to be addressed promptly to prevent sepsis and septic shock.
4. Liver failure: The patient's deteriorating hepatic function may lead to worsening encephalopathy and other complications associated with liver failure.
5. Leg swelling: Although there is no DVT, the leg swelling requires evaluation"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presents with ongoing hepato-renal syndrome and is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and pressor support. The patient has hypotension that requires two pressors, and he is also fungemic with budding yeast in his blood culture. He received one dose of micafungin on 04/30/2145, which was presumed not cleared due to hepatic failure.

The patient's renal failure is secondary to hepato-renal syndrome, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. The patient's family has requested that he be put back on CVVH in hopes of clearing up a bit. However, the renal team has advised against dialysis, stating that the patient would not survive without a liver transplant.

The patient also has leukocytosis, with blood cultures growing VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and budding yeast. The fungal infection is likely due to the CVVH, as the patient's immune system is compromised. The patient has received a dose of micafungin and will continue on dapto (D4).

In addition to the above complications, the patient has hep C cirrhosis, which has led to encephalopathy and a rising MELD/INR score. This is likely precipitated by SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) complicated by"

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple comorbidities. They are currently receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions to maintain blood pressure. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam and daptomycin.

24-hour events include stopping CVVH due to the patient's inability to tolerate it, and the family being notified to come see the patient. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 56/39 mmHg, as well as low body temperatures (Tcurrent: 35.4 C) and heart rate (HR: 97 bpm). Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ABG results indicate acidosis (7.23/34/80).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,602 mL, with outputs totaling 2,421 mL. The urine output is 1,084 mL, and the total blood product transfused is 310 mL. Laboratory results reveal thrombocytopenia (45 K/uL), anemia (8.9 g/dL), hyperglycemia (98 mg/dL), hypokalemia (3.5 mg/dL), hyponatremia (12 mEq/L), and acute kidney injury (Scr: 4.0). Other lab findings include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 370/598), abnormal blood gases (TCO2: 21/20/21), and altered white blood cell count (WBC: 20.6/21.8).

The patient has impaired aerobic capacity, arousal, attention, cognition, balance, gait, joint mobility, knowledge, motor function, muscle performance, sensory integrity, and transfers. Pain control, hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, and impaired skin integrity are also noted as concerns. The patient is on nutrition support, has glycemic control measures in place, and is receiving multiple medications through various lines. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are being taken. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by hepato-renal syndrome requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and pressor support. He has continued hypotension, with blood pressure in the 40s. CVVH was stopped due to the patient's inability to tolerate it. The family has been notified. The patient has renal failure due to hepato-renal syndrome. He also has decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with encephalopathy and rising MELD/INR, likely precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is not a transplant candidate due to his clinical status. He is likely to experience increased pain and respiratory distress with the discontinuation of CVVH. Pain relief is being provided with morphine on an as-needed basis. The patient is receiving nutritional support with Nutren Renal (Full) at 45 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a dialysis catheter, PICC line, and arterial line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do"
