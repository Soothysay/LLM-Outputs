   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo M with PMHx sig. ESRD s/p failed transplant and subsequent
   nephrectomy in [**8-7**] who p/w abdominal pain, found to have pericardial
   effusion with tamponade physiology on bedside ECHO.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Stable overnight, without clinical signs of
   tamponade; no hypotension, pulsus paradoxus or decompensated failure.
   DDx includes uremia, malignant effusion, infectious/tuberculous
   effusion.
   -- Follow pulsus
   -- Plan for cardiac cath in AM per Cardiology
   -- Hold ACE-I
   -- Continue beta blocker per home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: CT scan did not show an infectious process. Pain
   likely referred from pericardial distention
   -- Serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Ascites: Likely secondary to pericardial effusion leading to right
   sided congestion
   -- Continue to monitor
   .
   # Infiltrated IV: Exam is benign. Plastics has evaluated.
   - elevated arm, warm compressess
   - Plastics following, appreciate recs.
   .
   # Systolic CHF: As above, will hold ace inhibitor for now
   -- Monitor volume status, to be controlled by dialysis
   .
   # ESRD /  Hyperkalemia: Unable to give Kayexalate given nausea. Patient
   will need electrolyte disorder corrected
   - HD today
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. SVT: Resolved after IV metoprolol, likely in setting of uremia and
   electrolyte imbalance
   -- Continue beta blocker
   .
   # Hematuria: This has been ongoing since nephrectomy. Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 337**] in Urology.
   - check U/A, urine culture
   - f/u as outpatient.
   .
   # HTN: Given concern for hemodynamic decompensation, will hold
   antihypertensives with exception of short acting metoprolol
   .
   # Anemia: Previously noted to be iron deficient. Also likely from
   ESRD.
   - cont. iron
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia:
   - cont. home imipramine, citalopram, and clonazepam
   .
   # Hepatitis C:   check LFTs
   .
   FEN: no IVFs, electrolyte mgmt per HD, renal diet

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a significant medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a failed transplant and subsequent nephrectomy. He presented with an episode of narrow complex tachycardia at 3:30 am, which resolved after being given IV metoprolol. He also experienced nausea, for which he was given Zofran, but did not tolerate Kayexalate due to nausea. The renal team is ready to dialize today.

His vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate ranging from 73 to 155 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/76 mmHg to 144/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, as evidenced by an echocardiogram. This is a serious condition that can cause decreased cardiac output and hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes uremia, malignant effusion, and infectious/tuberculous effusion. The plan is to follow pulsus, hold ACE inhibitors, continue beta-blockers per home regimen, and perform cardiac catheterization in the morning as per cardiology.

He also has abdominal pain, which is likely referred from pericardial distention. A CT scan did not show an infectious"
