   Assessment and Plan
   This 59F with h/o alcohol and polysubstance abuse presented to [**Hospital1 3356**] with altered mental status and is transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] due to
   concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation.
   .
   * Vent, Laryngeal edema
   - Check cuff leak. If negative, would check CT neck/chest confirm no
   mass or bleeding
   - Wean hydrocortisone to 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Discuss with IP and ENT in morning
   - Wean to PSV tonight
   .
   * Bradycardia
   At least in part due to sedatives, as HR improved to 70-80's when
   propofol drip is weaned down. No evidence of head bleed on OSH CT scan
   worrisome for [**Location (un) 6003**] reflex. EKG is abnormal with precordial TWIs,
   but these have been present at least since [**4-26**] (not present on [**4-23**]
   [**Hospital1 632**] EKG however). Think ACS is unlikely. PE could also produce
   similar EKG findings though would expect a tachycardia rather than a
   bradycardia.  Vagal response also worth considering
 though no report
   of a common trigger such as significant pain, nausea etc. that might be
   contributory.
   - Check TSH
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry, atropine at bedside
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Appears to be improved, following commands.
   Unclear exactly what happened prior to her transfer to the [**Hospital1 632**] ER.
   Broad differential including medication effect eg narcotic overdose,
   CNS bleed ?of falls, renal failure. No history of recent substance use
   or EtoH to suggest intoxication or withdrawal. No evidence of infection
   prior to admission.
   - Attempt to wean sedation as tolerated, following neuro exam
   - Urine and serum tox screen
   .
   * dCHF
   Holding off on further diuresis. Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   .
   * Hypertension
   - Ok to continue amlodipine, can restart ACEI if needed Cr now back to
   reported baseline
   .
   * DM
   Glucose exacerbated by high dose steroid treatment
   - Covering with sliding scale, holding metformin in ICU
   .
   * Hypernatremia
   - Estimated free water deficit ~1.8L. Will correct with free water
   boluses, following Na.
   .
   * h/o EtoH and substance abuse
   - MVT/thiamine/folate, social work eval when extubated
   .
   * Anemia
   Baseline hct uncertain.
   - Check T+S, transfuse Hb>7, follow CBC daily
   - Guiac stools
   - Check iron panel/b12/folate
   .
   * ?Orbital floor fracture
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 632**] films, review with radiology. Per signout, more
   consistent with an old process.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse who presented to the hospital with altered mental status and concerns for laryngeal edema. She has been intubated and sedated, but is now showing signs of improvement as her sedatives are being weaned down.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), a heart rate of 52 bpm (normal range: 31-67 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 169/81 mmHg to 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 196.

The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 g/dL, blood glucose level of 193 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL. Her tro"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and is currently being treated in the ICU for concerns of laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 169/81 mmHg to 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Her temperature is within normal range, but her hemoglobin level is low at 9.5 g/dL.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Laryngeal edema: The patient has concerns for laryngeal edema, which can cause airway obstruction. The cuff leak test is negative, indicating no immediate airway compromise. However, a follow-up CT neck is pending to further evaluate the condition.

2. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, with a heart rate of 52 bpm. This could be due to sedatives as the heart rate improved when the propofol drip was weaned down. The patient's EKG shows abnormal findings, including precordial TWIs. No evidence of head bleed was found on the OSH CT scan. The cause of bradyc"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   Mrs [**Hospital1 6001**] does not have a cuff leak with only 2 cc of air
   needed for balloon inflation. Her neck CT does show laryngeal edema
   around the ETT cuff. She is easily arousable off sedation with
   improvement in her HR response.
   Exam notable for Tm 99 BP 167/66 HR 30-60 ( NSR) RR of 14 with sats of
   100% on CPAP/ PSV . She has clear lung fields, minimal ankle edema and
   no focal neurological signs. Reflexes are intact and not sluggish.
   Labs notable for WBC 7.4 K, HCT 29.5 , K+ 3.9 , Cr  0.7,  Neck CT
   reviewed as above.
   Agree with plan to Continue steroids, consult IP service for
   tracheostomy and assessment of airway post trach. For now we will
   switch to propafol for sedation and obtain PICC line so as to D/C left
   subclavian line which appears to have migrated upwards into left IJ.
   She is understanding of this procedure but quite tearful when told of
   the need to do this. We will try and establish contact with her
   daughter since consent for this procedure will need to be provided
   either by patient or her proxy.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status. She is currently intubated and sedated, and has concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 169/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her ABG results show pH 7.40, PaCO2 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 196.

The patient's physical examination reveals a regular bradycardic II/VI systolic murmur throughout the precordium, clear lungs bilaterally without rales, wheezing, or stridor, and warm extremities without edema. Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, blood glucose of 193 mg/dL, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal limits.

   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-29**], the endotracheal tube
   tip is
   about 5 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends well into
   the
   stomach. Left subclavian catheter again extends into the left internal
   jugular vein with the tip at about C4.
   Perihilar and lower lung opacities persist, again more prominent on the
   right,
   especially in the infrahilar region. This could reflect aspiration,
   pulmonary
   infection, or possibly even asymmetric pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
   (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus and ascending aortic levels
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
   is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function. Mild-moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse who presented to the hospital with altered mental status and laryngeal edema. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU due to difficulty weaning from sedation. The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium), laryngeal edema, bradycardia, respiratory failure, altered mental status (not delirium), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to various infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infection, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Further cultures are needed to determine the cause.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, which may be partially due to sedatives. Other potential causes include vagal response or an underlying condition such as pericardial effusion or myocardial infarction. Monitoring on telemetry and atropine at bedside is recommended.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented with altered mental status, but it appears to have improved. The cause of this alteration is unclear, with possible causes including medication effects, central nervous system (CNS) bleed, falls, renal failure, or intoxication/withdrawal. Neurological exams and urine/s serum tox screens are planned.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and is being treated in the ICU for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium), laryngeal edema, bradycardia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 156/67 to 110/54 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 36 to 77 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's lab results indicate abnormal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, troponin T, glucose, and several electrolytes. The results also show elevated levels of lactic acid, calcium, and magnesium.

The patient's imaging studies reveal persistent opacities in the perihilar and lower lung regions, suggesting possible aspiration, pulmonary infection, or asymmetric pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. The echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function, minimal aortic valve stenosis, and mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
   (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus and ascending aortic levels
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
   is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no

","The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. They have a fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. The patient is intubated and unable to provide their own medical history. They have allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and clindamycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1 F, blood pressure ranging from 156/67 to 196/90 mmHg, heart rate between 36-77 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 2,395 mL over the past 24 hours. They are receiving propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

Radiology findings reveal persistent opacities in the perihilar and lower lung regions, more prominent on the right side. This could indicate aspiration, pulmonary infection, or asymmetric pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. The echocardiogram shows a moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse who presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was transferred due to concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with fever, and cultures have been obtained. She has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin, due to concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, and hypertension, which require further management. Her altered mental status is being closely monitored, and an attempt will be made to wean sedation as tolerated. She is also being evaluated for possible substance abuse issues.

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's intubation and the presence of fever, there is a concern for VAP. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and sputum cultures have been sent for analysis.
2. Line infection: The patient has a central line placed, and there are concerns for a potential line infection. The line is planned to be pulled, and cultures will be obtained.
3. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which may be partly due to sedatives. The cause of the bradycardia needs further"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with recent changes in mental status, brief intubation, recurrent respiratory distress, and re-intubation. She has a fever of 101.1°F and is experiencing respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. The patient has a history of anxiety, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and altered mental status. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 50% FiO2 and has a RSBI of 110.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's fever may indicate an infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Prophylactic medication should be given to prevent this complication.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, which can increase the risk of hypotension during extubation.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient is on high-flow oxygen, but there is still a risk of hypoxemia during extubation due to laryngeal edema.

These are potential complications that could arise,"

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with recent changes in mental status, brief intubation, recurrent respiratory distress, and re-intubation. She now presents with a new fever of unclear origin. The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. 

Key findings include:
- Fever: The patient has been febrile since yesterday and was started on antibiotics. 
- Laryngeal edema: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to laryngeal edema.
- Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which is likely due to medication.
- Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved but will be reassessed when extubated.
- Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels.
- Anxiety: The patient is anxious.
- Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension, and medication is being increased.
- Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever may be due to VAP or a line infection. Antibiotics have been started, and the line will be changed today.

Plan:
1. Extubation in the operating room with tracheostomy placement if extubation fails. Consent has been obtained from the patient or her daughter if the patient cannot provide consent.
2. Continue antibiotics for VAP versus line infection.
3. Monitor bradycardia and adjust medication as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was transferred due to concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a ventilator mode set to CPAP/PSV. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin and stress ulcer medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and lower lung opacities on imaging may suggest this possibility.
2. Line infection: The patient has a central line in place, and there are concerns about a possible line infection, especially considering the subclavian catheter malposition and persistent fever.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has been experiencing bradycardia, which could be related to sedatives or other underlying conditions such as ACS, PE, or vagal response.
4. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with altered mental status, and it is unclear what exactly happened prior to her transfer. Medication effects, CNS bleed, falls, renal failure, or substance use could be contributing factors.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been exacerbated by high-dose steroid treatment, and she requires close monitoring and management.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed appropriately.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has since resolved, but should be monitored for any potential electrolyte imbalances.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and further evaluation and management are required.
9. Orbital floor fracture: There is a possible old orbital floor fracture that needs to be evaluated further.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of her various medical conditions and complications in the ICU setting."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of laryngeal edema. The patient is currently in the ICU due to various medical conditions, including anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium), laryngeal edema, bradycardia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status (not delirium), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent several medical interventions, including the insertion of a multi-lumen line and attempts to place a subclavian line, which was unsuccessful. The patient's daughter consented to the placement of a tracheostomy.

The patient's vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 157/64 mmHg to 165/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 278 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 125.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin T levels, along with elevated blood glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and is now in the ICU due to concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation.

The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 157/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging shows a right internal jugular catheter with the tip projecting at the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and no pneumothorax. The left subclavian catheter is malpositioned, and the endotracheal tube tip is 6.4 cm from the carina. There are left perihilar and lower lung opacities which could reflect aspiration or infection.

Impressions include interval placement of the right internal jugular catheter with tip projecting at the lower SVC, no pneumothorax, and possible line infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is hemodynamically stable and has a"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and difficulty weaning from sedation. The patient has been diagnosed with laryngeal edema and is currently intubated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and lower lung opacities on imaging may suggest this condition.

2. Line infection: The subclavian catheter was placed at another hospital and might have been a source of infection. The patient's fever curve is trending down, but pending cultures will provide further information.

3. Bloodstream infection: Similar to the line infection, there is a risk of a bloodstream infection, especially if the subclavian line was infected.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although not explicitly mentioned in the note, patients with prolonged hospital stays and urinary catheter use are at risk for developing UTIs.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which could be due to sedatives. Other potential causes include ACS (acute coronary syndrome), PE (pulmonary embolism), or a vagal response. Monitoring the patient's heart rate and considering further investigations is important.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improved,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 59F with h/o alcohol and polysubstance abuse presented to [**Hospital1 3356**] with altered mental status and is transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] due to
   concerns for laryngeal edema and difficulty weaning from sedation.
   .
   *Fever: DDx includes VAP given intubation, blood stream infection,
   UTI.  Concerned for possible line infection (subclavian placed at OSH).
   Hemodynamically stable.  No leukocytosis.  Less likely clot or
   medications at this point.

   * Bradycardia
   At least in part due to sedatives, as HR improved to 70-80's when
   propofol drip is weaned down. No evidence of head bleed on OSH CT scan
   worrisome for [**Location (un) 6003**] reflex. EKG is abnormal with precordial TWIs,
   but these have been present at least since [**4-26**] (not present on [**4-23**]
   [**Hospital1 632**] EKG however). Think ACS is unlikely. PE could also produce
   similar EKG findings though would expect a tachycardia rather than a
   bradycardia.  Vagal response also worth considering
 though no report
   of a common trigger such as significant pain, nausea etc. that might be
   contributory.
   - TFTs c/w sick euthyroid
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry, atropine at bedside

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse who presented to the hospital with altered mental status and difficulty weaning from sedation. The patient has laryngeal edema, which is likely contributing to her difficulty in extubation. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Fever and worsening lung opacities on imaging could indicate this condition.

2. Line infection: The subclavian line placed at OSH is malpositioned, and there is concern for a possible line infection. Cultures have been sent to confirm the presence of an infection.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, which could be due to sedatives or other causes such as vagal response, ACS, PE, or medication effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to various factors such as medication effects, CNS bleed, falls, renal failure, or intoxication/withdrawal. Additional testing, including neuro exams and urine/tox screens, will help in identifying the cause.

5. Hypotension and hypertension: The patient is currently being treated for both hypotension and hypertension. The management plan includes adjusting medications and closely monitoring blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. She has a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and anxiety. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including failed extubation, placement of a multi-lumen line, and administration of antibiotics. She is currently sedated and unable to provide her own history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient's fever has improved after changing her central line and starting antibiotics. However, there is still a risk of infection, as indicated by the pending culture from the line. The patient may develop a hospital-acquired infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is indicated by her sodium level of 136 mg/dL. This condition can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and electrolyte imbalances if not corrected.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 38-68 bpm. Bradycardia can be caused by medications or underlying cardiac conditions. Monitoring the patient's heart rate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. She has a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and anxiety. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke, heart failure, or kidney damage.
3. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with appropriate medication and blood sugar control to prevent complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, neurological symptoms, and potentially life-threatening complications if not corrected.
5. Laryngeal edema: The ongoing laryngeal edema poses a risk for airway obstruction during extub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of alcohol and polysubstance abuse. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and laryngeal edema, and was transferred due to concerns for difficulty weaning from sedation. She has been diagnosed with fever, laryngeal edema, bradycardia, altered mental status, decompensated heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a history of ethanol and substance abuse, anemia, and a possible orbital floor fracture. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, and she is already being treated with antibiotics.
2. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, which increases the risk of line-associated infections.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of steroids and anticoagulants puts her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and prolonged bed rest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's altered mental status and history"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was recently intubated for altered mental status (traumatic) after experiencing laryngeal edema. She underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has a history of anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium), laryngeal edema, bradycardia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status (not delirium), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. 

The plan includes continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI), elevating the head of bed (HOB), weaning FiO2, trying oral intake, consulting speech-language pathologist (SLP), restarting outpatient bipolar medication, and restarting home hypertension/heart failure medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by elevating the head of bed and performing regular lung secretion clearance techniques.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged imm"
