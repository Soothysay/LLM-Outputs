   -  Keep intubated on PS till pressor requirement improves and pain is
   better controlled. Likely extubation in AM
   - once extubated, will need close observation as at increased risk for
   CHF
   - Increase fentanyl and wean versed to keep pain minimal and as awake

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy with end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon from Clostridium difficile colitis. He has a significant medical history of diverticulitis, sigmoid colectomy, NSTEMI, and ARF. The patient tolerated the surgery well but developed fever, hypotension, and tachycardia overnight. He received aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which improved his condition.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.4Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 75%, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. His central venous pressure (CVP) improved from 0 to 10 mmHg after fluid resuscitation.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with softness and an end ileostomy that is producing brown stool without blood or stool odor. His extremities show 1+ edema in both legs. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal impairment with a creatinine level of 1"

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, previous sigmoid colectomy, NSTEMI, and acute renal failure. He presented with abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and leukocytosis, and was found to have Clostridium difficile infection. He underwent total colectomy with end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon. In the ICU, he experienced minimal blood loss during surgery and was stabilized. However, he developed a fever and showed signs of hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. His vital signs indicate tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased heart rate. He has been sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be indicative of hypovolemia or sepsis. Close monitoring and volume resuscitation are recommended to maintain CVP (central venous pressure) at 10-12 and MAP (mean arterial pressure) at 60-65.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient may be experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by crackles in the chest and overbreathing on the ventilator. FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) should be decreased to 50%, and RR (respiratory rate) should be increased. Fluid overload should be ruled out, and the CVP should be closely monitored.
3. Infection:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy with end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon caused by Clostridium difficile (CDiff) colitis. The patient has a history of diverticulitis, sigmoid colectomy, NSTEMI (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction), and acute renal failure (ARF).

In the 24 hours since the last update, the patient developed fever and hypotension, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and the initiation of pressors. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) improved from 0 to 10 this morning. Urine output (U/O) has also improved. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and Flagyl.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 75%. The patient is intubated and on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 40. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 268, and a ventilation-perfusion mismatch indicated by the low SvO2.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male who recently underwent a total colectomy due to recurrent diverticulitis and a diagnosis of toxic megacolon.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG surgery and severe aortic stenosis (AS).
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2Â°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 40, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate levels, and blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.
- The patient has an ileostomy output of 129 mL, urine output of 129 mL, and is receiving intravenous fluids (LR at 150cc/hr) and antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole).
- The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and is currently being treated with oral vancomycin. However, the patient's large bowel distension is concerning for toxic megacolon.
- The patient's post-operative management includes nasogastric tube (NPO), wound care, monitoring ileostomy output, and respiratory support.
- The patient's medical history also includes NSTEMI and ARF.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which puts him at risk for developing flash pulmonary edema, especially when his fluids are mobilized.
2. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for CDI and has a history of recurrent diverticulitis. There is a possibility of developing other infections due to his compromised immune system.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if the patient develops ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), suggesting a bleeding risk.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG surgery, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy due to recurrent diverticulitis, post-operative non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient had a positive test for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, indicating an infection with C. difficile colitis. Surgical intervention was required, leading to the total colectomy and end ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU for post-operative management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), sedation breaks, and daily respiratory system assessment are being implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient had a positive test for C. difficile toxin A and B, indicating an infection. The source of infection has been removed by performing a total colectomy, but there is still a risk of complications associated with C. difficile infection, such as severe diarrhea and colonic dilatation (toxic megacolon).
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CAB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a recent sigmoid colectomy, who presented with recurrent diverticulitis and subsequently developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). He was admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and found to have pancolitis on a CT scan of the pelvis. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B and has been difficult to manage with oral vancomycin. He underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon. The patient remains in the ICU for post-operative management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Toxic megacolon: This is a severe complication of Clostridium difficile infection characterized by massive dilation of the colon. It can lead to perforation and sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection and inflammation may lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and subsequent sepsis, which can result in organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's severe aortic stenosis and recent surgery, there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially during weaning off mechanical ventilation.
4. Flash pulmonary edema: Given the patient's severe aortic stenosis, fluid overload, and risk of rapid fluid mobilization, there is a potential for flash pulmonary edema, which is a rapid onset of pulmonary edema.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a sigmoid colectomy on 2125-5-25 due to recurrent diverticulitis. Postoperatively, he experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He was admitted to the ICU on 6-4 with abdominal pain and was found to have pancolitis on a CT scan of the pelvis. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, which has been difficult to manage with oral vancomycin. His condition worsened, leading to concern for toxic megacolon, and he underwent a total colectomy and end ileostomy on 2125-6-16.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the prone position with pressure-controlled ventilation. He is receiving sedation with midazolam and analgesia with fentanyl. Pressors are being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient has been weaned off levophed and is now on neosynephrine. His heart rate and ectopy have improved.

Fluid balance and respiratory support are being closely monitored. The patient is producing adequate urine output, and his ileostomy output is being monitored. Pain control measures are in place, and plans are underway to switch to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Wound care is being performed per the surgical team's instructions.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is on statins when taking orally. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been held due to his recent NSTEMI. An arterial line, multi-lumen central line, and PICC line have been placed. Prophylactic measures include low-molecular-weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Measures are in place to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy for toxic megacolon due to Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient has a past medical history of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute renal failure (ARF). Post-operatively, the patient developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to infection.

24-hour events include the administration of antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam), as well as the initiation of midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/82 to 119/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Flow sheet data shows an adequate fluid balance with a total input of 6,393 mL and output of 1,186 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 910 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly acidic pH of 7.34, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 310, and ventilation rate of 7.3 L/min.

Laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 27.9 K/uL, elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 33.7%, and slightly elevated platelet count (Plt) of 384 K/uL. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are consistent with the patient being well-nourished, alert, and responsive to commands. The patient has crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, a distended abdomen with tenderness, and 1+ edema in the lower extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Fluid Shifts: The patient's hypotension is likely due to infection and inflammatory response post-surgery. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics have improved the patient's condition.
   - Continue close monitoring of CVP.
   - Follow up urine output and attempt to keep it >30 cc/hr.
   - Follow up creatinine levels.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is comfortable on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode with a tidal volume of 910 mL.
   - Crackles may be due to atelectasis or fluid overload."

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy for toxic megacolon due to Clostridium difficile colitis. He has a past medical history of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute renal failure. The patient tolerated the surgery well but developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) possibly due to infection post-operatively. 

24-hour events include dropping mean arterial pressures (MAPs) with levophed and vasopressin weans yesterday, receiving fluids for resuscitation, maintaining good central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output (UO). The patient was getting pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) with runs and tachycardia on levophed and vasopressin in the setting of a recent myocardial infarction. The patient's heart rate and arrhythmia improved on neosynephrine. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed, showing pulmonary edema. A chest X-ray also shows pulmonary edema. A cardiology consult was requested for hemodynamic management.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o M s/p total colectomy s/p end ileostomy for toxic megacolon from
   cdiff colitis. Past hx significant for recent NSTEMI, AS 0.8 area.
   Developed hypotension with fever overnight after sx requiring massive
   fluid resuscitation and pressors. Developed pulmonary edema in the
   setting of known critical AS.
   #1. Hypotension/fluid shifts:
   Likely due to infection and likely inflammatory response post abdominal
   surgery and was aggressively volume resuscitated.
   Pressor requirements improved after fluid resuscitation and broad
   spectrum antibiotics. However, last evening had persistent need for low
   dose Levophed and was having runs PACs with apparent hemodyanamic
   effect so decision was made to switch to low dose Neosynephrine for a
   few hours which was
   CXR with pulm edema this am, however stable on the vent with good
   oxygenation pn FIO2 0.4, PEEP 5 and PIP low 20
   Mixed venous 79% so unlikely to be acute decompensated heart failure.
   It is possible that he is volume overload and overdistened so
   reasonable to try to get him 1L negative with Lasixx gtts and assess
   impact on hemodynamics but I would not push more aggressively than this
   right now.
   CVP 8
 12, Watch U/O,  keep > 30 cc/hr.
   #2. Resp Failure: ON AC stable setting good rsboi, hold off on
   aggressive weaning while sorting out hemodynamics but may be able to
   PSV again this afternoon late evening.
   -  CXR wet, but oxygenating and ventilating wet.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] have some underlying [**Doctor Last Name **] due to abdominal surgery.
   #3. ID:
   -          Broaded to Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl due to fever/hypotension.
   -          All cxs neg so far.
   -          D/c after 72 hrs if Cxs neg (except flagyl if cdiff neg)
   #4. CAD, AS, recent NSTEMI:
   - Hold ASA - Add beta blocker when BP improves - Restart statin when
   able to take pos. Keep MAP > 65 to sustain coronary perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, sigmoid colectomy, NSTEMI, and acute kidney injury. He developed cdiff toxic megacolon and underwent total colectomy with end ileostomy. Postoperatively, he developed SIRS due to infection. 

24-hour events include a drop in mean arterial pressures (MAPs) with Levophed and Vasopressin weaning, fluid resuscitation, and maintenance of good central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output (UO). The patient was getting pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) with tachycardia on Levophed and Vasopressin, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and was switched to neosynephrine. The patient received fluids continuously to keep up CVP and UO. His heart rate and arrhythmia improved on neosynephrine. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed PACs but no signs of ischemia. A chest X-ray (CXR) revealed pulmonary edema. A cardiology consult was requested for heart failure management.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at different times. He is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  At 1AM, CVP dipped to 7,  so I shut off the

   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt if it continues to drop off (??)

The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted on 6/4 with abdominal pain and diagnosed with pancolitis on CT scan. He tested positive for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, which led to a total colectomy and end ileostomy due to concerns of toxic megacolon. The patient is currently in the ICU for critical AS (aortic stenosis) with hemodynamic instability requiring pressors to maintain MAPs. He is experiencing pulmonary edema, tachycardia, and has been switched from levophed to phenylephrine overnight. Fluids are being held as he is volume overloaded, and his urine output (UOP) and central venous pressure (CVP) are being closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, recent sigmoid colectomy, recurrent diverticulitis post-op course complicated by NSTEMI, acute renal failure (ARF), readmission with abdominal pain, diagnosis of pancolitis on CT, positive clostridium difficile toxin A and B, subsequent increasing large bowel distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical resection, and total colectomy with end ileostomy. The patient now presents with significant volume overload in the setting of critical AS.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Volume Overload: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure (BP) and labile central venous pressure (CVP), indicating volume overload. This is further supported by the presence of pulmonary edema. Gentle diuresis with lasix gtt has been attempted, but due to low CVP, lasix gtt has been held. It is important to continue gentle diuresis as MAP (mean arterial pressure) and CVP tolerate, and follow up with cardiology recommendations.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient sustained non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and currently has anemia with hematocrit (Hct) level of 22. Considering blood transfusion to prevent recurrent ischemia and assist with intravascular volume/third spacing. The patient is currently on no other cardiovascular medications, and it"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  Patient started on lasix gtt however at At
   1AM, CVP dropped to 7 and lasix was d/ced for the remainder of the
   night. MAPs stayed stable.
   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt however ---total I/Os approximately even over
   last 24 hrs
   -Started TPN as the patient has been NPO for a long time and has a low
   albumin likely contributing to his edema.  Got a pre-mixed standard

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, recent sigmoid colectomy, recurrent diverticulitis post-op course complicated by NSTEMI, ARF, readmission with abdominal pain, and subsequent increasing large bowel distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical resection. The patient underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy. He now presents with significant volume overload in the setting of critical AS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has low blood pressure and is experiencing pulmonary edema, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to further respiratory distress, decreased cardiac output, and potential heart failure.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient's critical AS puts him at risk for recurrent ischemia and potential cardiac events. It is important to closely monitor his cardiovascular status and consider blood transfusion to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further ischemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is currently off pressors. This could be due to volume depletion or ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring of his hemodynamic status is essential to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. Continued monitoring of his ileostomy output and administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary to manage this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), recent sigmoid colectomy, recurrent diverticulitis post-operative course complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), readmission with abdominal pain, finding of pancolitis on CT, and positive clostridium difficile toxin A and B. The patient underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy due to severe AS and continues to diurese well. The patient's current conditions include severe AS, anemia with Hct 22, and C. diff colitis. The patient is on TPN for nutrition and IV Flagyl for C. diff colitis. The patient's respiratory status is stable on CMV with FiO2 40%, TV 500, RR 14, and PEEP 5. The plan includes weaning sedation for possible extubation evaluation, monitoring ileostomy output, wound care, and following up with cardiology and surgery recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient is being diuresed for volume overload in the setting of severe AS. Close monitoring of I/O and CVP is necessary to avoid hypovolemia.
2. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe AS may lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and cardiac status is important.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct of 22 indicates anemia, which may exacerbate ischemia and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Blood transfusion may be considered to address the anemia.
4. C. diff Colitis: The patient has an ongoing infection with C. diff, which can lead to worsening colitis and potential complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation. Close monitoring of ileostomy output and continuation of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
5. Respiratory Status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV, and weaning sedation is planned. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is important to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.
6. Wound Complications: The patient has a slight erythema and mild oozing of the inferior pole of the surgical wound. Close monitoring and wound care are essential to prevent wound infection or dehiscence.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and additional details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), recent sigmoid colectomy, and a history of recurrent diverticulitis post-operation. The patient was readmitted on [**6-4**] with abdominal pain and was found to have pancolitis on CT, positive clostridium difficile toxin A and B, and subsequent increasing large bowel distension concerning for toxic megacolon. The patient underwent a total colectomy and end ileostomy. The patient is currently experiencing volume overload and severe AS, with a valve area less than 0.8.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient continues to diurese well, but there is a risk of continued fluid overload due to the severe AS and ongoing diuresis. Close monitoring of the patient's intake and output is necessary to achieve the goal of I/O negative 2-3 liters.

2. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area less than 0.8. This condition can lead to syncope, angina, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. The patient is currently anemic with a Hct of 22, which increases the risk of recurrent ischemia. Blood transfusion may be considered to prevent recurrent ischemia and to assist with intravascular volume and limit third spacing. Gentle diuresis as above should continue, and the patient should restart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, recent sigmoid colectomy, and a history of recurrent diverticulitis. He was readmitted with abdominal pain and diagnosed with pancolitis due to Clostridium difficile infection. Subsequently, he underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy. The patient is currently being dursed for volume overload in the setting of severe AS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has severe AS and is tolerating diuresis well, but there is a risk of developing hypotension if diuresis is not closely monitored and adjusted.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is on aspirin. It is important to keep his hematocrit (Hct) above 30 and consider adding a beta-blocker when his blood pressure allows.
3. Surgical Site Infection: There is mild erythema and oozing at the inferior pole of the surgical wound. This requires close monitoring and discussion with the surgery team.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient needs further diuresis and should be maintained on pressure support for now.
5. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient still requires treatment for C. diff colitis, which includes continued Flagyl IV."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, recent sigmoid colectomy, and a history of recurrent diverticulitis. He was readmitted with abdominal pain and diagnosed with pancolitis caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A and B. He underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy due to severe aortic stenosis. The patient is currently in the ICU for volume overload and respiratory support. His vital signs are stable, but he has significant peripheral edema. He is tolerating diuresis well and is planned to be extubated in the morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and is experiencing volume overload, which can lead to heart failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if extubation does not go as planned.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms.
4. Sepsis: Given the patient's recent surgery and history of diverticulitis, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.

The patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, who underwent a sigmoid colectomy on 05/25/2125. He was readmitted on 06/04 with abdominal pain and was found to have pancolitis on CT, positive for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B. He subsequently developed large bowel distension concerning for toxic megacolon and required a total colectomy and end ileostomy on 06/16. The patient is now being dursed for volume overload in the setting of severe AS. He is tolerating diuresis well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has a negative 4 liter yesterday and is still 3L positive for LOS. Continuing diuresis with Lasix is recommended to achieve a negative 1-2L balance.
2. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient's valve area is 0.8cm, indicating severe AS. Tolerating diuresis well, but may require further intervention for rate and blood pressure control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of critical aortic stenosis, who underwent a colectomy and end-ileostomy for toxic megacolon caused by Clostridium difficile infection. He also had a recent admission summarized in the ICU team's note. The patient has improved substantially. The major issues addressed today include respiratory failure, which was resolved and the patient was successfully extubated, volume overload managed with diuretics and discontinuation of acetazolamide, severe aortic stenosis requiring rate control, coronary disease managed with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy, post-colectomy ileostomy wound assessment, pain control, and treatment for C. diff colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure but has since been resolved and successfully extubated. However, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as severe aortic stenosis and coronary disease.
2. Volume overload: The patient had volume overload, which was managed with diuretics and discontinuation of acetazolamide. Continued fluid management will be necessary to prevent recurrence of volume overload.
3. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which requires rate control and ongoing management. This condition can lead to complications such as syncope, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
4. Coronary disease:"
