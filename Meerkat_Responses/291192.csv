   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with chief complaints and was ruled out for myocardial infarction but found in an acutely delirious state, presumably due to unforeseen ethanol withdrawal.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/102 to 120/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and ABG results are not provided.

The patient's physical examination shows that he is sedated, withdraws to painful stimuli but non-conversant, with clear lungs bilaterally, slightly tachycardic with normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallops. The abdomen is described as obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds. There is trace pitting edema bilaterally and WWP (which could be referring to wounds, ulcers, or pressure sores).

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, glucose of 56 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium of 105 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride of 138 mEq/L, calcium of 9.4 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.8 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR of 12.8/27.2/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 3736/__/_, ALT/AST of 32/70, Alk Phos/T Bili of 62/0.7, and various other lab results.

The patient's assessment and plan include potential medical complications such as likely ethanol withdrawal, elevated CK levels suggesting muscle breakdown and concern for rhabdomyolysis, acute coronary artery disease with multiple risk factors, hand lacerations, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer with urinary hesitancy, and others. 

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Rhabdomyolysis due to the elevated CK levels and need for restraints.
2. Ethanol withdrawal, which is already being managed with Ativan and Haldol.
3. Acute coronary artery disease, considering the patient's risk factors and presentation.
4. Infection, given the presence of fever and potential for delirium.
5. Pressure ulcers or wounds due to prolonged bed rest or immobility.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and potential hypercoagulable state.
7. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and medications.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo male with h/o HTN, DM2, and hyperlipidemia, who presented with CP
   and ruled out for MI, but was found in an acutely delirious state
   presumably due to unforeseen EtOH withdrawal.
   # Likely ETOH withdrawal
   -- continue Ativan 2mg IV q1PRN CIWA>10
   --appreciate psych recs, needing ativan far more frequently than TID,
   but added haldol as prn
   -- Head CT unremarkable
   -- r/o organic etiology with TSH, B12, folate, RPR
   -- urine and serum tox screens negative
   -- thiamine and folate via banana bag, add po when tolerating
   -- can use BB for hypertension and /or tachycardia
   .
   # Elevated CK: Pt had CK 1865 on presentation, arguing towards a fall
   or muscle breakdown prior to presentation. Concern for rhabdomyolysis
   that may further increase given his delirium and need for restraint.
   -- trend CKs, apear to be peaking
   -- UA with Tr blood, but 1 RBC, so not clearly myoglobinuria
   -- aggressive IVF with NS
   -- monitor RFTs
   .
   # CAD - never formally documented, but has several risk factors and a
   CAD equivalent in DM.
   -- when able to tolerate po's, will continue medical management with
   ASA, ACE-I
   -- will give BB IV prn
   -- continue SL Nitro 0.3mg PRN pain
   -- hold on statins given evidence of rising CK
   .
   # Hand lacs: Pt incurred 2 lacerations on his dorsal R hand during
   delirium. Appreciate plastics c/s.
   -- Hand x-ray negative for FB
   -- UTD on tetanus (documented in OMR from [**8-28**])
   -- bacitracin daily
   .
   # HTN - on multiple medications at home, now unable to take po
   -- will give BB IV, hold ACE-I and CCB for now, can add back prn
   .
   # DM2: stable. Pt is seen at [**Last Name (un) 72**].
   -- Continue Lantus 32u qhs, 1/2 dose if NPO
   -- Humalog SS
   -- Finger sticks qachs
   .
   # Hx prostate ca with urinary hesitancy: Stable.
   -- Continue terazosin, Enablex (darifenacin), tamsulosin when
   tolerating po
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On ezetimibe/simvastatin at home.
   -- hold simvastatin given rising CKs, ok to continue ezetimibe if tol
   po
   .
   # FEN:
   -- regular diet when tolerating po's, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -- Subcutaneous heparin, home pantoprazole

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted two days ago with chest pain but ruled out for acute coronary syndrome. The patient is now in the ICU due to acute delirium resulting in destructive behavior and self-injury.

The patient has been diagnosed with ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal/delirium, and his assessment and plan include starting Ativan 4mg every four hours, continuing benzodiazepines with adjunctive Haldol as needed, administering multivitamins, thiamine, folate, and following up on Vitamin B12 and folate levels. The patient's tachycardia and hypertension are still present.

The patient also has lacerations but no significant deep injury. His chest pain was negative for troponins and ECG, so a stress test in the future is recommended. He should continue taking aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker if able to take pills.

His elevated creatine kinase (CK) level is likely related to injury, and the plan is to trend it and provide hydration with normal saline.

The rest of the plan is mentioned in the resident's note. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted two days ago for chest pain and is now in the ICU due to acute delirium resulting in destructive behavior and self-injury. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/66 mmHg to 198/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is sedated and not fully alert. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and troponin-T levels, along with other abnormalities in electrolytes and liver enzymes. Imaging studies such as a head CT and RPR are negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing episodes of delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as ethanol withdrawal, infection, or medication side effects. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, self-injury, and worsening overall condition.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and other lab abnormalities may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with chest pain and was ruled out for myocardial infarction, but was found in an acutely delirious state presumably due to unforeseen ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition has improved today, but he continues to receive reduced doses of lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation and haloperidol as needed. Blood cultures have been sent, but infection is unlikely. The patient's blood glucose levels are stable, and he is seen by an endocrinologist. He also has a history of prostate cancer with urinary hesitancy, which remains stable. The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with ezetimibe/simvastatin, although simvastatin has been held due to elevated CK levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may continue to experience symptoms of ethanol withdrawal, such as agitation and delirium. Close monitoring and adjustment of benzodiazepine dosage will be necessary.
2. Falls: The patient fell from a chair to the ground overnight, reporting head and knee pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan has been ordered to rule out any bleeding in the brain. Falls precautions should be continued to prevent further falls.
3. Elevated CK levels: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated, which may indicate muscle"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted two days ago with chest pain but was ruled out for cardiac problems. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to acute delirium resulting in destructive behavior and self-injury. 

The patient has been doing much better today and is currently being treated for suspected ethanol withdrawal/delirium. His head CT was negative, and other tests such as TSH, RPR, Vit B12, and folate were normal. The patient is receiving Ativan 1mg every four hours with adjunctive Haldol as needed. 

The patient also experienced a fall this morning but did not show clear evidence of trauma. He will be monitored and kept in bed for now. The patient had lacerations, but they were not significant and were managed by plastics. Tetanus is up-to-date, and bacitracin is being applied to the wounds. 

The patient had chest pain, but negative troponins and an ECG indicated no cardiac issues. A stress test may be considered in the future, and the patient will continue taking ASA, statin, and beta-blockers if able to take pills. 

The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated, likely related to injury, and peaked at 3700 yesterday. The patient will start taking oral medications today"
