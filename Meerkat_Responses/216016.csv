   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   67W fevers yesterday along with greater bloody discharge from her
   enterocutaneous fistula and sent to ER from rehab. Seen recently twice
   in ER by surgery because of this issue.
   In ER her BP fell requiring IVF and levophed which has been stopped.
   She was given antibiotics and admitted. She has been seen by surgery
   who is requesting an updated abdominal CT.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has a history of metastatic colon cancer, receiving palliative chemotherapy, and an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient was admitted after experiencing fevers and bloody discharge from the fistula. She required IV fluids and vasopressor support but has since been weaned off the vasopressor. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is awaiting further evaluation of her condition.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance indicates an input of 512 mL and output of 1020 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 508 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///22/.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is comfortable and not in distress. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and she has decreased breath sounds in her lungs. The abdominal area shows a dressed fistula with no extreme edema. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's critical condition.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hematocrit of 28.8%, platelet count of 330 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has a history of metastatic colon cancer, receiving palliative chemotherapy, and an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient was seen twice in the emergency room due to bloody discharge from the fistula and required IV fluids and vasopressor support. She was admitted and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

24-hour events include a fever yesterday along with an increase in bloody discharge from the fistula. The patient's blood pressure fell, necessitating the initiation of IV fluids and levophed, which has since been stopped. She was given antibiotics and seen by surgery.

The patient's allergies include latex, oxaliplatin, iodine, fluconazole, and ace inhibitors. Her last dose of antibiotics was given 24 hours ago. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 to 116/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 512 mL and a total output of 1020 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 508 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer C33D8 5-FU/Leucovorin
   presenting with fever, hypotension and blood per enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Hypotension: SBP to 80s in ED and on arrival to ICU after 2 units of
   NS. Pt is mentating well, strong peripheral pulses, voiding. DDx
   includes hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Hypovolemia is a possiblity given poor
   po intake (on TPN), ?blood loss from fistula site (less likely). Sepsis
   also possible - fever, elevated WBC in an immunocompromised host (see
   below).
   - IVF for MAP goal >60
   - Levophed if needed to maintain above
   - Foley for close output monitoring
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Vanco/Zosyn
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum.  Follow up on speciation of blood cultures from
   rehab, which are reportedly positive.
   - CXR - repeat in am
   - Consider CT abd/pelvis in am if blood cx from rehab positive for
   GNR.
   - serial HCTs, transfuse for HCT < 21 or increased bleeding.
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Potential sources include lines (PICC, port)
   though neither look infected, pulmonary (increased effusions on CXR),
   abdominal - fistula site vs. abscess vs. C. dif.
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Vanco/Zosyn
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum.
   - CXR - repeat in am
   - Consider CT abd/pelvis in am if blood cx from rehab positive for
   GNR.
   - check serum lactate
   .
   # Bloody fistula drainage: Surgery consult tonight, serial hematocrits
   - q4hr. Ostomy/wound care consult for fistula site. NPO Hold heparin,
   pneumoboots.
   - Repeat Hct 12pm
   .
   # Metastatic colon cancer: now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1862**] (heme/onc) and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Plan is for staging CT abd/pelvis tomorrow if she is able
   to gauge response to chemotherapy.
   -restart anti-diarrheals
   .
   # H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinux on hold due to
   recent bleeding.
   .
   # Wound: ostomy consult. Continue topical therapies and local care.
   .
   # DM - Not on meds at home.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever and hypotension. She has an enterocutaneous fistula and is experiencing bloody drainage. The patient has a history of allergies to latex, oxaliplatin, fluconazole, and angioedema with ACE inhibitors. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving IV fluids and norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, and her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be caused by hypovolemia due to poor oral intake and potential blood loss from the fistula site. Sepsis is also a possibility given the fever and elevated white blood cell count in an immunocompromised host. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The patient has an enterocutaneous fistula, which can lead to complications such as infection, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid loss. The bloody drainage from the fistula site needs to be managed appropriately.

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, potential sepsis, fever, leukocytosis, bloody fistula drainage, and metastatic colon cancer. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 101/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 330 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 111 mg/dL. 

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) for suspected sepsis, and her blood cultures are positive. She also has an enterocutaneous fistula with small volume liquid red/brown stool. 

The patient's assessment and plan include IV fluids for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg, use of Levophed if needed, close output monitoring with a Foley catheter, and consultation for surgery and ostomy/wound care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, development of sepsis due to the positive blood cultures, further bleeding from the enterocutaneous fistula, and complications related to her metastatic colon cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever and hypotension. She has an enterocutaneous fistula with red/brown liquid stool. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of rash or edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and slightly decreased hemoglobin levels. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and receiving chemotherapy for her colon cancer. Potential complications include hypotension, sepsis, and bleeding from the enterocutaneous fistula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the low normal range, indicating hypotension. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure to prevent further drops.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and immunocompromised status due to chemotherapy increase the risk of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
3. Bleeding from enterocutaneous fistula: The patient has an enterocutaneous fistula with ongoing drainage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition. The patient has a history of allergies to latex, oxaliplatin, fluconazole, and angioedema with ace inhibitors. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) for potential sources of infection such as lines, pulmonary effusions, abdominal issues, or C. diff. Further investigations including repeat chest X-ray, CT abdomen/pelvis, and serial hematocrits are planned. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are being closely monitored. She is on clear liquid diet and insulin for glycemic control. The patient has multiple comorbidities including possible PE/SVC syndrome, port-related clots, wound care, and diabetes mellitus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and potential sources of infection, there is a risk of sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Hemodynamic instability: Due to the patient's hypotension and ongoing fluid resuscitation, there is a risk of developing hemodynamic instability.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications. These include hypotension, fever and leukocytosis, bloody fistula drainage, metastatic colon cancer, history of PE/SVC syndrome, wound care, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a possible hypovolemic shock due to poor oral intake, blood loss from the fistula site, or sepsis. Immediate interventions include IV fluid administration, monitoring urinary output, and administering broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an infection. Potential sources include lines (PICC, port), pulmonary effusions, abdominal issues at the fistula site, abscess, or Clostridium difficile infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated, and further investigations such as repeating chest X-ray, stool and sputum cultures, and CT abdomen/pelvis should be done.
3. Bloody fistula drainage: Surgical consultation is required to address the enterocutaneous fistula. Serial hematocrits should be monitored, and ostomy/wound care consult is necessary. Heparin should be held.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever and hypotension. She has an enterocutaneous fistula with small volume liquid red/brown stool. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal glucose levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. It is crucial to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage this condition.

2. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The presence of an enterocutaneous fistula with bloody discharge increases the risk of infection and fluid imbalance. Surgical consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management of the fistula.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever and hypotension. She has an enterocutaneous fistula with small volume liquid red/brown stool. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still experiencing hypotension. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A surgery consult has been requested for the bloody fistula drainage, and imaging studies are planned to evaluate potential sources of infection and assess the extent of her metastatic colon cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate hypovolemia or sepsis. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure through IV fluids and vasopressors are necessary.
2. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The presence of an enterocutaneous fistula can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing fluid loss. Close monitoring of fluid balance and nutritional support may be required.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but further evaluation and treatment may be needed to identify the source of infection.
4. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient's underlying condition of metastatic colon cancer may contribute to her overall prognosis and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving Zosyn monotherapy for a Gram-negative rod bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and a heart rate of 85 beats per minute. She is on IV fluids and being monitored closely for output. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly abnormal liver enzymes. The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's hypotension and potential sepsis, monitoring fluid balance, managing the bloody fistula drainage, and considering further imaging studies for staging purposes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and poor oral intake may indicate hypovolemia, possibly due to fluid loss from the fistula site or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Enterocutaneous fistula complications: The presence of a bloody fistula drainage could lead to further complications such as infection, electrolyte imbalances, or malnutrition.
4. Metastatic colon cancer progression: The patient's underlying cancer may continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. The patient has a history of poor oral intake, which may contribute to hypovolemia, but sepsis is also a possibility due to fever, elevated white blood cell count in an immunocompromised host, and gram-negative rods in blood cultures.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is in the 95-105 range, but it was in the 80s in the emergency department and upon arrival to the ICU after receiving 2 units of normal saline. Since admission, the patient is alert, has strong peripheral pulses, and voids well. Differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia versus sepsis. Hypovolemia is possible due to poor oral intake (on total parenteral nutrition) and potential blood loss from the fistula site. Sepsis is also possible due to fever, elevated WBC, and GNR in blood cultures.

Plan:
- IV fluids for mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal >60
- Levophed if needed to maintain above
- Foley catheter for close output monitoring
- Zosyn monotherapy for GNR
- Follow-up blood cultures from rehab, which are GNR
- Serial hematocrits
- Ostomy/wound care consult following

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension and fever. The patient has been diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer and is currently being treated with chemotherapy. She is also experiencing an enterocutaneous fistula with red/brown stool output. Her vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 87/51 mmHg, fever with a temperature of 37.1 C, tachycardia with a heart rate of 82 bpm, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's medical history includes latex allergy, rash from oxaliplatin, angioedema from fluconazole, and contraindication to ace inhibitors. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 04/18/18 at 08:00 AM, piperacillin on 04/19/18 at 12:00 AM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04/20/18 at 12:00 AM. The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU, including pantoprazole (Protonix), levophed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension and fever. She has a history of metastatic colon cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and a heart rate of 82 beats per minute. She also has an increased respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and is on supplemental oxygen. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a nasal cannula. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1 degrees Celsius.

The patient has received fluids but still has low urine output, with only about 2 liters coming out from the ostomy. Her urine analysis shows slight protein but no leukocytes or nitrites. Her blood work indicates anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count of 22,000 K/uL. Other labs show elevated potassium levels and decreased sodium and chloride levels.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is comfortable, alert, and oriented. There are no signs of jugular venous distention or murmurs appreciated on auscultation. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended, but there is an enterocutaneous fistula with small volume liquid red/brown stool. The patient has increased swelling in the right lower extremity compared to the left.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and supportive care. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia and sepsis. Potential complications that can arise include hypotension, decreased urine output, fever, leukocytosis, and possible sources of infection such as lines, pulmonary effusions, abdominal issues, or Clostridium difficile. The patient also has a bloody fistula drainage and may require surgical consultation, ostomy/wound care consult, and repeat hematocrits. Additionally, she has metastatic colon cancer and requires follow-up with her oncologists for staging CT abdomen/pelvis."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is consistently in the 80s, indicating persistent hypotension. This may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Immediate management includes IV fluids and monitoring for signs of shock.

2. Sepsis: The patient has fever and an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests the possibility of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further therapy will be tailored based on culture sensitivities.

3. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The patient has a bloody fistula, leading to blood loss and poor oral intake. Surgical consultation is required for evaluation and management of the fistula.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's urine output is low, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is less than 1%, raising concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consult is recommended to evaluate urine for oliguric ATN and rule out obstruction from tumor burden.

5. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has metastatic colon cancer, which requires ongoing follow-up with oncology and consideration of chemotherapy treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. The patient's main medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed infection with E. coli, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone (CTX). She has been switched from piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) to CTX D5/14. The patient is currently hypotensive and febrile, which raises concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values will be crucial.

2. Decreased UOP (urine output): The patient's urine output is low, and her fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is less than 1%. This indicates a potential acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or obstruction from tumor burden. Continuous monitoring of urine output and serial renal function tests are necessary to assess kidney function.

3. Bloody fistula drainage: Although the bleeding from the fistula has decreased, there is a possibility of ongoing blood loss. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels will need to be closely monitored, and transfusions may be required if the Hct drops below 21 or if there are signs of increased bleeding.

4. Metastatic colon cancer: The patient has metastatic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, and her blood cultures grew out Zosyn-sensitive E. coli. She is currently on TPN due to poor oral intake, and there is a concern for hypovolemia or sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is responding well to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection. It is important to continue aggressive treatment to control the infection and stabilize the patient's condition.

2. Hypovolemia: Poor oral intake and potential blood loss from the fistula site may lead to hypovolemia, causing low blood pressure and compromised organ perfusion. Close monitoring of fluid balance and appropriate fluid resuscitation may be required.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN vs. obstruction): The patient's urine output is decreased, and her serum creatinine remains stable. Further evaluation is needed to differentiate between acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and obstruction caused by tumor burden.

4. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient's underlying condition is metastatic colon cancer, which may require ongoing management by the oncology team. Treatment options such as chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer C33D8 5-FU/Leucovorin
   presenting with fever, hypotension and blood per enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Sepsis
 SBP to 80s in ED and on arrival to ICU after 2 units of NS.
   Pt is mentating well, strong peripheral pulses. DDx includes
   hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Hypovolemia is a possiblity given poor po
   intake (on TPN), ?blood loss from fistula site (felt to be less
   likely). Sepsis also possible - fever, elevated WBC in an
   immunocompromised host (see below).  BCx grew out Zosyn, CTX-sensitive
   (FQ, Bactrim resistant) E.coli.
   - IVF for MAP goal > 60
   - Foley for close output monitoring
   - CTX D5/14 (was on Zosyn for 4 days)
   - serial HCTs, transfuse for HCT < 21 or increased bleeding.
   .
   # Decreased UOP: FeNa < 1%, but still worry about ATN vs. obstruction
   from tumor burden.  Patient with somewhat improved UOP from yesterday
   (still low) but serum Cr remains stable.
   - renal U/S unremarkable
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Bloody fistula drainage
 Hct stable. Bleeding has dropped off.
   .
   # Metastatic colon cancer: now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1862**] (heme/onc) and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Now that power PICC in place, plan for CT torso (with
   desensitization protocol).
   - will hold on desensitization, CT torso pending call out to OMED
   - continue anti-diarrheals
   .
   # H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinaux on hold due to
   recent bleeding.
   .
   # Wound: ostomy consult. Continue topical therapies and local care.
   .
   # Nutrition: Restart TPN, nutrition c/s
   # DM - Not on meds at home.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by an E.coli infection that is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. Her respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her SpO2 is 100%. The physical examination reveals a large enterocutaneous fistula with an ostomy bag in place, along with tan stool output.

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and stable creatinine levels. Other lab results include slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels, as well as normal sodium, chloride, and calcium levels. The assessment plan includes treating the sepsis with IV antibiotics, optimizing fluid management, close monitoring of urine output, and further evaluation for potential complications such as acute tubular necrosis or obstruction from tumor burden.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis due to the E.coli infection. It is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection or organ dysfunction.

2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and poor oral intake may indicate hypovolemia. Adequate fluid resuscitation should be"

   fistula.
   HYPOTENSION -- Hypotension: SBP to 80s in ED and on arrival to ICU
   after 2 units of NS. Pt is mentating well, strong peripheral pulses,
   voiding. DDx includes hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Hypovolemia is a
   possiblity given poor po intake (on TPN), ?blood loss from fistula site
   (less likely). Sepsis also possible - fever, elevated WBC in an
   immunocompromised host (see below). GNRs in blood from OSH
   - IVF for MAP goal >60
   - Levophed if needed to maintain above
   - Foley for close output monitoring
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Zosyn, will narrow therapy today based on
   sensitivities from OSH, D4 of 14 given indwelling lines for salvage
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum.  Speciation of blood cultures from rehab
   E.coli, fluoroquinolone and bactrim resistant
   - CT abd/pelvis when access appropriate, powerpick today
   - serial HCTs, transfuse for HCT < 21 or increased bleeding.
   E.Coli BACTEREMIA -- cultures from [**Hospital1 632**].
   # Decreased UOP: FeNa < 1%, but still worry about ATN vs. obstruction
   from tumor burden
   - renal consult, evaluate urine for oliguric ATN
   - renal u/s to rule out obstruction
   - hold on IVF until further work-up completed
   Doubt colovesicular fistula.
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Potential sources include lines (PICC, port)
   though neither look infected, pulmonary (increased effusions on CXR),
   abdominal - fistula site vs. abscess vs. C. dif.
   - Broad spectrum abx for now with Zosyn, will tailor therapy based on
   sensitivities
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum.
   - CT abd/pelvis when access possible
   .
   # Bloody fistula drainage: Surgery consult tonight, serial hematocrits
   - q4hr. Ostomy/wound care consult for fistula site. NPO Hold heparin,
   pneumoboots.
   - Repeat Hct 12pm
   .
   # Metastatic colon cancer: now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1862**] (heme/onc) and

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypotension, and blood per enterocutaneous fistula. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with warm and dry skin. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. The potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Immediate management includes fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressor support if necessary.

2. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The patient has an enterocutaneous fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the intestine and the skin. This can lead to significant fluid and electrolyte losses, as well as infection. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential. Nutritional support may also be required.

3. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and elevated white blood cell count. Blood cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and therapy will be tailored based on sensitivity results.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yof metastatic colon cancer with extensive abdominal wall
   enterocutaneous fistula.
   HYPOTENSION
 Attributable to Sepsis, with perhaps component of
   hypovolemia (poor po intake, and perhaps component of GI blood loss
   from extensive entero-cutaneous fistula).  Improved.  Now off
   vasopressor.  Plan continue monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Zosyn, will narrow therapy today based on
   sensitivities from OSH, D4 of 14 given indwelling lines for salvage
   E.Coli BACTEREMIA -- cultures from [**Hospital1 632**].  Likely GI source.
   Continue antimicrobials, adjust according to final culture
   sensitivties.
   RENAL FAILuRE --  No evidence for renal obstruction.  Doubt
   colovesicular fistula.  Suspect prerenal from 3^rd spacing in context
   of sepsis.  Monitor UO, Bun,Creat.
   ANEMIA
 blood loss, although not severe, on background of ACD
   (malignancy).  Monitor serial Hct.
   FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS
 attributed to sepsis, from bactereemia (GI
   source).  Continue antimicrobials.  Consider abd CT to assess for
   abscess.
   GI BLEED -- Bloody fistula drainage, improved.  Serial Hct.
   Ostomy/wound care consult for fistula site. NPO Hold heparin,
   pneumoboots.
   [**Last Name (un) 12117**] CA,  metastatic, extensive -- Plan is for staging CT abd/pelvis
   tomorrow if she is able to gauge response to chemotherapy.
   H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots -- Fondaparinux on hold due to
   recent bleeding.
   DM --  insulin s/s  as needed to maintain glucose <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old individual with metastatic colon cancer and an extensive abdominal wall enterocutaneous fistula. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which has improved and is now off vasopressor. The patient also has an ongoing cutaneous fistula with biliary and stool drainage but no blood. Urine output is improving, and the patient denies abdominal pain.

The patient has allergies to latex, oxaliplatin, iodine, fluconazole, and ace inhibitors. The last doses of antibiotics were given on 04/19/2164 at 12:00 AM (Piperacillin), 04/20/2164 at 07:50 AM (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), and 04/20/2164 at 11:37 AM (Ceftriaxone).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 mmHg to 127/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 332 K/uL"
