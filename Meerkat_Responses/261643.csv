   #  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Her constellation of symptoms is most
   likely secondary to respiratory decompensation in the setting of a
   viral URI and poor respiratory reserve.  Contributing factors to her
   poor respiratory function include known pulm hypertension and ILD,
   though it is unclear whether this is secondary to sarcoidosis or
   another etiology.  Notably, her CXR appears more concerning when
   compared to prior imaging studies, as her interstitial changes are more
   marked, and this is concerning for progression of ILD.  Arguing against
   progression of pulm htn is her overall improvement on sildenafil, as
   noted on her recent appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-25**].  Other

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/61 to 169/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on high-flow nasal cannula. She has crackles on lung examination and bilateral small effusions with compressive atelectasis seen on chest CT. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments for different conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms may be secondary to respiratory decompensation, potentially due to a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) and poor respiratory reserve. Contributing factors include known pulmonary hypertension and ILD. Other etiologies to consider include pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia.

2. Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: The patient has a history of moderate pulmonary hypertension with unclear etiology, possibly secondary to sarcoidosis. There is evidence of more profound lung disease on chest X-ray, but she was doing well in clinic prior to admission. Treatment options include continuing sildenafil, monitoring for signs of right heart failure, and performing an"

The note mentions that the patient has new bilateral small effusions and compressive atelectasis with scattered thickened septal lines, which may indicate edema, less likely changes related to sarcoid. The chest CTA did not show any pulmonary embolism, but the evaluation of subsegmental vessels at the left base is limited.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/61 mmHg to 169/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on high flow neb.

The physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally 1/3 up in the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, right and left extremities with 1+ edema, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 29.1%, platelet count of 228 K/uL, and troponin T level below 0.01. The chest CTA preliminary read indicates no pulmonary embolism, but"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her conditions.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's constellation of symptoms is most likely secondary to respiratory decompensation in the setting of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) and poor respiratory reserve. Contributing factors to her poor respiratory function include known pulmonary hypertension and ILD, though it is unclear whether this is secondary to sarcoidosis or another etiology.

2. Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: The patient underwent right heart catheterization in December 2011 and had pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 53/23. PA hypertension of unclear etiology, possibly secondary to sarcoidosis though pattern on chest CT not typical for this disease. Now appears to have more profound lung disease on chest x-ray, but was doing well in clinic one week prior to admission so unlikely to have sildenafil treatment failure.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is currently on antihypertensive medications including ACEi, CCB, and beta-blocker.

4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes is stable, and she is currently on oral hypoglycemics. It is mentioned to hold oral hypoglycemics and use insulin sliding scale (ISS) instead.

5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is at baseline of 1.5, and she requires renally dosed medications.

6. Other considerations: The patient also has chronic renal insufficiency, electrolyte imbalances, and requires prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
   area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-11-2**], the
   right ventricle appears slightly larger and free wall motion appears
   similar to slightly more depressed. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure is now higher.

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and is currently admitted to the ICU. 

24-hour events:
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed increased dilation of the right ventricle, increased pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), and worsening free wall motion abnormality on the right side. The ejection fraction (EF) was measured at 60%.
- The patient had an intake/output of -500 mL at 3 pm and was given another 40 mg IV lasix. However, her labs showed a creatinine increase from 1.4 to 1.7, so further diuresis was stopped.
- Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1707**] was concerned about congestive heart failure (CHF) given the effusions and thought it would be best to trend brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and lactate to see if the patient was improving. They agreed to hold further diuresis overnight due to the creatinine elevation.
- Antibiotics were discontinued as the patient was afebrile, with no leukocytosis, and a chest CT inconsistent with bacterial pneumonia.

   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
   area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-11-2**], the

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and the etiology of hypoxia is unclear. There are concerns for congestive heart failure (CHF) and diuresis was administered yesterday; however, it caused an elevation in creatinine/BUN. The patient also has pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. It is important to identify the underlying cause of the hypoxia to guide treatment.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's clinical presentation and findings on TTE suggest worsening CHF. If left untreated, this condition can progress to severe heart failure, leading to poor cardiac output and organ perfusion.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension/Right Heart Failure: The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension and evidence of right heart failure. If not properly managed, this can lead to worsening right ventricular dysfunction and potentially fatal outcomes.

4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure with unclear etiology of hypoxia. There are concerns for congestive heart failure (CHF) and diuresis was given but stopped due to creatinine elevation. The patient also has pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and no evidence of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential life-threatening condition that may require immediate intervention.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest the possibility of CHF. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially fatal outcomes.
3. Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: The worsening pulmonary artery hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction increase the risk of right heart failure. This can result in poor perfusion and organ damage.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If not managed properly, it can progress to renal failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The lab results show abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels. Imbalances in these electrolytes can disrupt various bodily functions and require careful monitoring and management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has shown an increased dilation of the right ventricle (RV), increased pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), worsening free wall motion abnormality on the right, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%. The TTE also revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular systolic function, dilated right ventricular cavity, mild global free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, and mild aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/58 mmHg to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.7, indicating possible pre-renal azotemia due to diuresis. Other lab values are within normal limits.

   increased from 1200--> 3000, which can be due to CHF or PAH

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was initially concerned for congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretics were administered, but this led to an increase in creatinine/BUN levels. The patient's oxygen requirements have increased, and there is a concern for unexplained hypoxia. TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showed worsening pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) and worsening right ventricular function.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia does not seem to be explained by infection or volume overload. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. CHF vs ILD: The patient's symptoms could be due to CHF or ILD. BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and lactate levels will be monitored to assess the degree of CHF and perfusion status. This will help differentiate between the two conditions.

3. Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: The patient's PAH has worsened, which could be related to hypoxic bronchoconstriction. Sildenafil therapy will be continued, and the dose may be increased. Lasix will be used cautiously due to preload dependence of the right ventricle. Steroids may be considered to treat ILD"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency. The etiology of hypoxia is unclear, with initial concerns for congestive heart failure (CHF) that has been diuresed with Lasix. However, diuretic use has resulted in an increase in creatinine/BUN levels. The patient's BNP and lactate levels are being monitored to assess the degree of CHF and whether she is adequately perfused. This may help determine the etiology of pleural effusions.

The patient's worsening PAH on TTE could be due to hypoxic bronchoconstriction. Empiric Vanc/Levo were discontinued as there is no evidence of infection clinically or on imaging. The patient is being weaned off the shovel mask as tolerated, and consideration is being given to a Swan-Ganz catheter to measure pulmonary and wedge pressures and differentiate between CHF and ILD.

Regarding pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, the patient was doing well in clinic one week prior to admission, so it is unlikely that sildenafil treatment failure is the cause. Sildenafil is being continued, and the possibility of increasing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea likely due to diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, not ILD. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of continued hypoxia. Monitoring and adjusting oxygen delivery devices may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: The worsening pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular strain on echocardiography suggest progressive right heart failure. Increasing the dose of sildenafil, a medication used to treat pulmonary hypertension, may be considered.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. Renal dosing of medications and close monitoring of renal function are essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Fluid overload: The elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) suggest fluid overload. Continued diuresis with lasix and close monitoring of fluid balance are crucial to manage this condition.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, pulmonary hypertension, renal function, and fluid balance."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old female with history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary
   hypertension, ILD, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who presents with acute
   on chronic dyspnea
   .
   #  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Swan-ganz placed and increased wedge
   pressures. Diuresed yesterday with 40mg IV lasix X 3. Net negative 1.1
   L: in 24hours and 900ml overnight.  BNP decreased today suggesting less
   ventricular dilation. Lactate decreased suggesting better perfusion.
   - recheck wedge pressure to assess if adequate diuresis and continue to
   diurese if necessary
   - Flu swab negative
   - empiric vanc/levo were discontinued as no evidence of infection
   clinically or on imaging
   - wean shovel mask as tolerated
   #  Pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure: Was doing well in clinic
   one week prior to admission so unlikely to have sildenafil treatment
   failure. TTE showed worsening PAH but likely from elevated wedge
   pressure.
   - cont sildenafil and consider increasing dose
   - cont lasix
   - cte to f/u BNPs/lactate as above.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] consider steroids to treat ILD if swan shows worsening PAH and
   consider flolan in the future.
   # Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine at baseline of 1.5 prior to
   diuresis then bumped to 1.7 likely [**2-5**] pre-renal azotemia from
   diuresis.
   - renally dose meds
   -trend creatinine

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with acute on chronic dyspnea. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency. 

For hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient was placed on a Swan-ganz catheter with increased wedge pressures. She received diuretics yesterday with 40mg IV lasix X 3, resulting in a net negative fluid balance of 1.1 liters in 24 hours and 900ml overnight. Her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) decreased today, suggesting less ventricular dilation. Lactate levels also decreased, indicating better perfusion. 

The plan is to recheck the wedge pressure to assess if adequate diuresis has been achieved and to continue diuretic therapy if necessary. Empiric antibiotics (Vanc/Levo) have been discontinued as there is no evidence of infection clinically or on imaging.

For pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure, the patient was doing well in clinic one week prior to admission, so it is unlikely that she has treatment failure with sildenafil. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but this is likely due to elevated wedge pressure.

The plan is to continue sildenafil and consider increasing the dose. Las"
