   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, osteoporosis, presenting with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia. He was intubated in the emergency department due to respiratory distress and has been on nonrebreather (NRB) support overnight. He received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED, and his lactate level was elevated but is now coming down with fluids.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and hospital-associated pneumonia, for which he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole. Sputum culture, follow-up blood and urine cultures, pulmonary toilet, nebs as needed, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in the long term after acute exacerbation have been planned.

He is also being treated for hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic, with 1000 mL normal saline (NS) boluses overnight and maintenance fluids. Additional 1L NS bolus and electrolytes every 6 hours with slow correction of sodium are recommended.

The patient's hypertension medication, atenolol, has been held, and metoprolol will be considered for blood pressure control when there are no signs of sepsis. Aspirin (ASA) is to be continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of congenital deafness, hypertension, osteoporosis, and others. He is currently in the ICU with a suspected aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for both hospital-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. It is important to monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms or signs of sepsis.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and careful correction is needed to prevent rapid shifts in fluid balance. Monitoring electrolytes and mental status is crucial to avoid complications related to rapid correction of sodium levels.
3. Spinal fracture: The patient has an unstable spinal fracture and requires immobilization with a collar. There is a risk of further injury if the collar is removed or if the patient undergoes procedures such as bipap ventilation without proper stabilization.
4. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombosis is necessary.
5. Bowel regimen and stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on a bowel regimen and stress ulcer prophylaxis while being NPO. Monitoring for any gastrointestinal complications is important.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of congenital deafness, hypertension, osteoporosis, and depression. He presents with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 114/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but has decreased muscle bulk in the arms and legs bilaterally, left arm rigidity, and toes that are mute bilaterally. Reflexes are intact. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, elevated potassium, low sodium, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Chest X-ray shows right worse than left bibasilar infiltrates.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration events and the presence of cough with right worse than left bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and sputum culture is planned to guide further treatment.
2. Hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient's recent hospitalization increases the risk of developing HAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential pathogens.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with history of deafness and recent fall with C-spine injury
   requiring collar placment.  He now has a picture of worsening
   aspitation with po intake while at home with multiple witnessed
   aspiration events.  He then went to ED for eval with intermittent
   aspiration and worsening weakness.  He came to ICU with fever and
   respiratory distress consistent with aspiration pneuomnia.
1)PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION--Clearly an increase risk with limited
   mobility and will remain at issue with prolonged need for neck
   stability.  This is likely related to need for current admission with
   Sepsis iwth pulmonary source and likely aspiration mechanisms.
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   -Frequent suctioning and chest PT needed
   -Sputum cultures pending
   -High flow, humidified oxygen
   -Some improvement in bandemia
   -High O2 requirement and high index of bandemia leads to significant
   concern for possible acute lung injury
   2)Sepsis--Modest lactic acidosis, likley pulmonary source and patient
   with favorable response to initial IVF.
   -Expect improvement with adequate volume replacement
   -Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Lactate trend to down already
   3) HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)-This has shown minimal
   change with NS replacement, this is quite likely related to the fact
   that urine OSM is significantly elevated in the setting of significant
   hypovolemia
   -Replace volume
   -WIll go to 3% NS if continued correction needed despite return of
   adeuate volume.
   -Use of NS to replace volume today

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of deafness and a recent fall resulting in a cervical spine injury. He has been experiencing intermittent aspiration and worsening weakness, leading to admission to the ICU with fever and respiratory distress consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia-aspiration, sepsis, and hyponatremia. He is receiving antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl) and requires frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy. High flow, humidified oxygen is also being administered. There has been some improvement in bandemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1) Pneumonia-aspiration: The patient's limited mobility and need for neck stability increase the risk of further aspiration, which can lead to worsening pneumonia. This may require continued aggressive airway management and respiratory support.

2) Sepsis: The patient's modest lactic acidosis indicates systemic inflammation, and the pulmonary source of sepsis should be closely monitored. Adequate volume replacement and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended.

3) Hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality): The patient's sodium levels have shown minimal change despite normal saline replacement. This is likely related to significant hypovolemia. Volume replacement and careful monitoring of electrolyte levels are necessary.

Overall, the patient's current condition requires close monitoring and management of the aforementioned medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, and osteoporosis. He presents with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and hospital-associated pneumonia since admission. He received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the emergency department. The patient's lactate levels were elevated initially but are coming down with fluids.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 110/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on bipap. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sitting up in bed with a hard cervical collar in place. He has PERRL and EOMI, mildly injected conjunctiva, and a bipap mask in place. His lungs show bilateral coarse rhonchi. His abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly or shifting dullness. Neurological examination is not assessable due to the language barrier and the use of a bipap mask.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, sodium of 138 mg/dL, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 102 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia based on clinical presentation and CXR findings. He has received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, including vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and hospital-associated pneumonia. Sputum culture, follow-up blood and urine cultures, pulmonary toilet, nebs as needed, and consideration for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in the long term after acute exacerbation have passed.

2. Hyponatremia: This is likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. The patient appears dry with a history of not taking in good POs. He received 1000 ml normal saline (NS) boluses overnight with maintenance fluids. He is currently mentating well. He has a history of low sodium but usually in the 130 range. Additional 1L NS bolus, electrolytes q6hours, and slow correction with no more than 10meq/ml per 24H.

3. Hypertension: Holding atenolol for now. When sure no signs of sepsis, will give metoprolol for BP control. Continue asa.

4. Spinal fracture: In location 408 J collar."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M with PMH of congential deafness, HTN, osteoporosis who presents
   with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia.
   .
   #1 Aspiration Pneumonia: Based on clinical presentation, CXR findings,
   elevated WBCs with bands. Patient received levoflox and clinda in the
   ED. His lactate was elevated in the ED and is coming down with fluids.
   Sputum with mixed picture on gram stain.  Broad spectrum abx coverage
   w/zosyn and flagyl. Patient in respiratory distress all day yesterday
   and in the evening. Patient becomes tachypnic and Tachycardic with HR
   to 150
 EKG shows MAT.  Distress consistently improves with 2mg
   Morphine.  Unlikely to recover from pneumonia given inability to wean
   off bipap and cough to clear own secretions and b/c of DNI status
   cannot intubate and suction secretions out.  Patient visibly
   uncomfortable on cpap, asked me to take mask off.  Last night patient
   removed mask by self and desaturated into 70
s.  Likely that patient
   will fail cpap and preference would be to make him CMO before he
   becomes even more uncomfortable.  Because he was given several liters
   of fluid for Hyponatremia, possibility that diuresis may improve his
   oxygenation enough to be able to take him off the bipap although this
   is unlikely to result in significant improvement.
   -continue vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and
   hospital associated pneumonia day #1 of abx = [**2118-12-1**]
   -40mg Lasix IV x1, follow UOP, PO2
   -2mg morphine prn for air hunger, anxiety
   -HCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 777**] [**Name (NI) 2772**] (cousin) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2773**]) called and made aware of
   situation, will be updated mid-day so that she can make travel plans
   depending on patient
s condition and response to diuresis.
   -follow up blood and urine cultures and sputum culture
   -pulmonary toilet
   -nebs prn
   - will likely need PEG in long term after acute exacerbation has passed
   to reduce aspiration risk.
   .
   #2 hyponatremia: this is likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Clinically he
   appears dry with a history of not taking in good POs.  Got 1000 ml NS
   boluses overnight with maintenance fluids.  Was mentating very well
   yesterday although it is difficult to assess his mental status
   currently. Has history of low sodium but usually to the 130 range.
   Sodium has been improving slowly over since admission.
   - hold boluses for diruesis attempt outlined above.
   - electrolytes q6hours, attempt slow correction with no more than
   10meq/ml per 24H
   .
   #3 HTN: holding atenolol for now.
   -When sure no signs of sepsis, will give metoprolol for BP control.
   -continue asa
   .
   #4 agitation: improves with morpine. Is on Trazadone 100mg outpatient
   QHS, can consider re-starting tonight to reduce anxiety overnight.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   also consider seroquel or zyprexa.
   .
   #5 leukocytosis: likely contributors include aspiration pneumonia and
   stress reaction.
   .
   #6 MAT: occurs w/anxiety and tachypnea, improves with morphine
   -Now not to treat w/CCB or BB b/c of unstable bp.
   -To re-evaluate if continues once patient
s respiratory status is more
   stable.
   .
   # 7 spinal fracture: in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar. Discussed with neurosurgery
   pt needs to stay in collar due to unstable spinal fracture and should
   not be removed for bipap.  Would likely need surgery after collar is
   removed, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 452**] his neurosurgeon
   - [**Location (un) 408**] J collar to be removed if patient made CMO
   .
   # BPH with incontinence:
   -continue osybutynin
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: He normally has a macrocytic anemia and currently
   appears to have a normal HCT. This also implies he is very dry.
   -continue B12

The patient's oxygenation may improve with diuresis, but this is unlikely to result in significant improvement. The patient has a history of not taking in good oral intake, which could contribute to his hyponatremia. The patient's sodium level has been improving slowly since admission. The patient also has hypertension, agitation, leukocytosis, and a spinal fracture.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M with PMH of congential deafness, HTN, osteoporosis who presents
   with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia.
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonia: Based on clinical presentation, CXR findings,
   elevated WBCs with bands. Patient received levoflox and clinda in the
   ED. His lactate was elevated in the ED and is coming down with fluids.
   Sputum with mixed picture on gram stain.  Broad spectrum abx coverage
   -continue vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and
   hospital associated pneumonia day #1 of abx = [**2118-12-1**]
   -sputum culture
   -follow up blood and urine cultures
   -pulmonary toilet
   -nebs prn
   - will likely need PEG in long term after acute exacerbation has passed
   .
   # hyponatremia: this is likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Clinically he
   appears dry with a history of not taking in good POs.  Got 1000 ml NS
   boluses overnight with maintenance fluids.  He is currently mentating
   very well. Has history of low sodium but usually to the 130 range.
   -additional 1L NS bolus
   - electrolytes q6hours, attempt slow correction with no more than
   10meq/ml per 24H
   .
   # HTN: holding atenolol for now.
   -When sure no signs of sepsis, will give metoprolol for BP control.
   -continue asa
   .
   # spinal fracture: in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar. Discussed with neurosurgery
   needs to stay in collar due to unstable spinal fracture and should not
   be removed for bipap.  Would likely need surgery after collar is
   removed, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 452**] his neurosurgeon
   - [**Location (un) 408**] J collar
   .
   # BPH with incontinence:
   -continue osybutynin
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: He normally has a macrocytic anemia and currently
   appears to have a normal HCT. This also implies he is very dry.
   -continue B12
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   -continue calcium, vitamin D and Fosamax.
   .
   # Depression: continue escitalopram.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. IVF as above.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel regimen, H2 blocker for GI ppx
   while NPO. aspiration and fall precautions
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed on admission and reassessed on [**2118-11-1**]
   prior to placing cpap.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of congenital deafness, hypertension, osteoporosis, and others. The patient presents with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia.

The patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin and clindamycin) in the emergency department and is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole for aspiration pneumonia and hospital-associated pneumonia. The plan includes obtaining sputum culture, follow-up blood and urine cultures, pulmonary toilet, nebs as needed, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in the long term after the acute exacerbation has passed.

The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely hypovolemic in nature due to his dry appearance and history of not taking in good oral intake. He received 1000 ml normal saline boluses overnight with maintenance fluids, and his mental status is well. The plan is to give an additional 1L NS bolus and monitor electrolytes every 6 hours, attempting slow correction with no more than 10 meq/L per 24 hours.

The patient's hypertension is being held temporarily, and when there are no signs of sepsis, metoprolol will be given for blood pressure control. Aspirin will be continued.

The patient has an unstable spinal fracture, and a cervical collar"
