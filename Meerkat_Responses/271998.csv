","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV CKD, recent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeds, MSSA endocarditis, and cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (afib). He was transferred to the ICU for consideration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to hypotension and likely septic physiology. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Increased right pleural effusion.
2. Atelectasis and/or pneumonia involving the lingula and left lower lobe.
3. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive overnight but is now normotensive. There are concerns about septic physiology given the elevated white blood cell count from 27 to 18 on the 14th and positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test.
4. C. diff colitis: The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and will continue the treatment for 14 days after the last day of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Acute renal failure on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 2.6 on admission, and it has increased to 5.6. There is anasarca and nephrotic syndrome (albumin 0.7). Renal consult is recommended for CVVH versus hemodialysis.
6. Hypoxia: The patient likely has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV CKD, recent UGI bleeds, treatment for MSSA endocarditis, and cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for consideration of CVVH in the setting of hypotension and likely continuing septic physiology.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, C. diff colitis, acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, hypoxia, enterobacter cloacae UTI, DVT, atrial fibrillation, anemia, decubitus ulcers, diabetes mellitus, bipolar disorder/schizophrenia, GERD, hyperlipidemia, BPH, and Foley catheterization.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Increased right pleural effusion: This can lead to respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation.
2. Atelectasis and/or pneumonia: These conditions can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of infection.
3. C. diff colitis: This can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Acute renal failure: This can progress to chronic renal failure and require renal replacement therapy such as CVVH or HD.
5. Hypoxia: This can lead to tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.
6. Enterobacter cloacae UTI: This"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, current conditions, and treatment plan, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to septic physiology. This condition requires close monitoring and management of blood pressure.

2. Acute renal failure on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.6, but it has now increased to 5.6. He also has anasarca and a low albumin level. These findings suggest acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. Renal consult for CVVH vs HD is recommended.

3. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of smoking, which may contribute to underlying COPD. His hypoxia is likely related to volume overload and pulmonary edema caused by renal failure. Ipratropium nebs can be continued, and CVVH or HD may be considered for fluid removal.

4. Enterobacter cloacae UTI: The patient has a previous blood culture from [12-16] showing NGTD. After an 11-day course of ciprofloxacin, it was discontinued. Sensitivity data from OSH Micro lab should be obtained, and a urine analysis/culture should be sent.

5. DVT: The patient has a right superficial femoral vein thrombosis. He is at high risk for recurrent GI bleed. Hepar"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of stage IV CKD, recent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeds in the setting of duodenal ulcers, recent treatment for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with 3+ aortic regurgitation (AR), recent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib w/ rvr), and chronic renal failure.

The patient presented to the hospital with hypotension and likely septic physiology, as indicated by the elevated white blood cell count from 27 to 18 and positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is currently being treated with oral vancomycin for C. diff colitis.

The patient also has acute renal failure on chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 2.6 on admission and currently 5.6. The patient has anasarca (generalized swelling) and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 0.7 g/dL), suggesting nephrotic syndrome.

Other potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of smoking, which increases the risk of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, the patient's renal failure may contribute to volume overload and pulmonary edema.

2. Enterobacter cloacae urinary tract infection ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Likely  due to fluid overload and severe
   acidosis.  Oxygenating well, post intubation.  Wean FiO2, and will try
   to extubate once more fluid is removed.
   HOTN:  Given high WBC could be sepsis versus diastolic heart failure.
   Is fluid overloaded on exam so further IVF unlikely to help.  Continue
   Levophed.  Check echo to evaluate heart function.
   Septicemia/septic shock:  continue broad spectrum antibiotics.  Follow
   up blood cx and C. diff.  Echo to evaluate valves.
   Acidosis:  Normal lactate, AG=13, largely non-AG acidosis.  most likely
   due to renal failure, CVVH will help.  Has h/o RTA
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II/ hypoglycemia.  Unclear reason, could
   be due to sepsis.   Continue D10W.  Start TFs.
    DVTs:  Plan is to anticoagulate, as was  tolerating it at OSH.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE):  To get CVVH for severe acidosis and fluid overload.
   Anemia:  To get epo with HD.
   Decube ulcers:  Care as per wound care service.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, recurrent bacteremia, deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), atrial fibrillation, recent endocarditis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIBs). He was admitted to the ICU for massive fluid overload, poor mental status, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), worsening renal failure, and the need for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's condition has progressively worsened, leading to respiratory distress, hypotension, and the initiation of mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe acidosis and fluid overload, which may contribute to respiratory failure. Oxygenation is well-maintained on mechanical ventilation, but weaning of FiO2 and potential extubation will depend on further fluid removal.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible septic shock or inadequate perfusion. Levophed has been started to support blood pressure.
3. Sepsis/Sep tic Shock: The patient has a high white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, and further blood cultures will be obtained. An echocardiogram will be performed to evaluate valve function.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's chronic renal failure has worsened, leading to severe acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Likely  due to fluid overload and severe
   acidosis.  Oxygenating well, post intubation.  Wean FiO2, and will try
   to extubate once more fluid is removed.
   HOTN:  Given high WBC could be sepsis versus diastolic heart failure.
   Is fluid overloaded on exam so further IVF unlikely to help.  Continue
   Levophed.  Check echo to evaluate heart function.
   Septicemia/septic shock:  continue broad spectrum antibiotics.  Follow
   up blood cx and C. diff.  Echo to evaluate valves.
   Acidosis:  Normal lactate, AG=13, largely non-AG acidosis.  most likely
   due to renal failure, CVVH will help.  Has h/o RTA
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II/ hypoglycemia.  Unclear reason, could
   be due to sepsis.   Continue D10W.  Start TFs.
    DVTs:  Plan is to anticoagulate, as was  tolerating it at OSH.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE):  To get CVVH for severe acidosis and fluid overload.
   Anemia:  To get epo with HD.
   Decube ulcers:  Care as per wound care service.

 because of
   overall poor prognosis she believes that he would not want to go on
   with aggressive care, so he will be extubated and made CMO.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of chronic renal failure, recurrent bacteremia, deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), atrial fibrillation (AF), recent endocarditis, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIBs). He was admitted to the ICU for massive fluid overload, poor mental status, AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR), worsening renal failure, and the need for continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly, with the development of respiratory distress and acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He became hypotensive and required intubation after failing to respond to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient also experienced severe acidosis and required administration of D5% (5% dextrose in water) for correction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 69-77 mmHg systolic and 41-62 mmHg diastolic, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (ECG).

Laboratory findings indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver"
