","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, heart failure (diastolic), and peripheral vascular disease. She was initially admitted for hypothermia/bradycardia/hypotension, possibly due to a septic source. The patient recovered but became volume overloaded during that time.

She was sent to the floor and continued discussions regarding hemodialysis with renal. The patient transiently developed coagulopathy requiring a heme consult, which mostly improved. She experienced three triggers for respiratory distress with worsening volume overload.

A therapeutic thoracentesis was performed, removing 750 cc of transudative fluid with transient improvement but with recurrent desaturation (7.39/45/53). The chest X-ray showed some reaccumulation of fluid.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate 77 bpm (70-81 bpm), blood pressure 134/45 mmHg (66), respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute (11-29 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 97% on 80% FiO2. The patient's ABG results are pending.

During the physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and showed no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination revealed normal PMI, S1, and S2 sounds, with no S3 or S4 sounds. The peripheral vascular examination showed present"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. She was initially admitted with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension, possibly due to septic shock. The patient recovered but subsequently developed volume overload. She experienced transient coagulopathy and required a heme consult. The patient's respiratory distress worsened due to volume overload and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed, removing 750 cc of transudative fluid. However, there was a recurrence of desaturation and some reaccumulation of fluid was noted on the chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has a history of acute diastolic heart failure and ongoing pleural effusions, which can contribute to fluid overload and further respiratory distress.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia and pleural effusions raise suspicion for a possible PE. However, further testing may be limited by impaired renal function.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to complications such as neurological issues or seizures if not properly managed.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation, which can result in tissue damage or organ dysfunction if not corrected promptly.
5. Infection: The presence of pleural effusions and the patient's compromised immune system due to chronic illnesses"

   24 Hour Events:
   -lasix drip started for diuresis and titrated up to max of 20
   overnight.
   -bled profusely from SC heparin shot; stopped heparin and put on
   TEDS/pneumoboots.
   -renal recs: would like to start dialysis, but not sure that will fix
   her hypoxia.  also, think that hypernatremia is strange if we think she
   is volume overloaded.  She may be intravascularly depleted.  patient
   refused dialysis yesterday, but per nursing said she agreed to it
   today.
   This AM, patient reports that she is amenable to dialysis, although she
   would prefer to avoid it.  She denies symptoms from her hypoxia and has

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with CKD, diastolic dysfunction, and DM who is being
   transferred to the ICU with hypoxia in the setting of persistent b/l
   pleural effusions.
   # Hypoxia:  Unclear cause of hypoxia, but most likely from V/Q
   mismatch.  Patient has significant A-a gradient on prior ABGs.  Minimal
   volume overload from bilateral pleural effusions do not entirely
   account for her oxygen requirement.
   - Will get ABG on minimal O2 and maximal O2 to better quantify gradient
   - Lung imaging; either V/Q scan or Chest CT today to evaluate for PE or
   AVM as possible sources of hypoxia -> patient may need systemic
   anticoagulation if PE present.
   - continue diuresis with lasix drip for now as making some headway and
   Cr trending down
   - low threshold to start Abx if she develops fever, hypothermia, or

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM) who is being transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and persistent bilateral pleural effusions. She has a history of toe amputations and eschar. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 154/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is on high-flow oxygen therapy and has decreased breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, hypernatremia, and low platelet count. Imaging shows pulmonary edema that has improved slightly and bilateral pleural effusions that have also decreased in size. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and further evaluation for pulmonary embolism or arteriovenous malformation is needed. She requires optimization of diastolic dysfunction management, chronic kidney disease management, anemia treatment, coagulopathy monitoring, and hypernatremia management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating inadequate oxygenation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Although the pulmonary edema has improved slightly,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple complications.

24-hour events include the initiation of a Lasix drip for diuresis, which was titrated up to a maximum of 20 overnight. The patient experienced profuse bleeding from a subcutaneous heparin shot, leading to the discontinuation of heparin and placement on TEDS/pneumoboots. There are concerns about starting dialysis as it may not address the patient's hypoxia, and there is also a question regarding the patient's hypernatremia considering he may be intravascularly depleted. The patient initially refused dialysis but reportedly agreed to it today.

Infusions of furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium have been administered. Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F) with a current temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 92%.

   60yo woman with CKD, diastolic dysfunction, and DM who is being
   transferred to the ICU with hypoxia in the setting of persistent b/l
   pleural effusions.
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely from volume overload and recurrence of pleural effusion in
   this woman with diastolic dysfunction and renal failure.  She has a
   leukocytosis, which developed after her thoracentesis, but no cough or
   fever to suggest pneumonia.
   - continue diuresis with metolazone and lasix for now as she does
   respond with increased urine output and Cr is trending down with
   diuresis
   - definitive treatment would be dialysis, and would argue that she has
   failed medical management given recurrent episodes of hypoxia
   - would hold off on further thoracentesis as fluid quickly
   reaccumulates and she is on ASA/plavix
   - low threshold to start Abx if she develops fever, hypothermia, or
   cough
   - optimize management of diastolic dysfunction as below
   # Chronic Kidney Disease:
   Her Cr during this hospital stay has essentially been at her baseline,
   yet she is significantly volume overloaded.
   - suspect patient is headed for dialysis, but will need to discuss
   timing of initiation; per renal over weekend, could start today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - continue sevelamer
   # Diastolic dysfunction:
   Patient has been reported to have dilated cardiomyopathy in the past,
   but it is her right ventricle and not her left that is dilated on Echo,
   and her EF is relatively preserved.  She also has PAD, which is a
   coronary equivalent.
   - carvedilol was increased to 37.5 [**Hospital1 **] for improved rate control
   - if BP remains elevated, would add further antihypertensives
   - continue amlodipine
   .
   # Coagulopathy:
   PTT and INR slightly elevated (40 and 1.3).  Per review of notes,
   patient's inhibitor screen is negative, UPEP is still pending.  SPEP
   was negative.
   - appreciate hem/onc recs
   - f/u UPEP
   - monitor coags
   - nasal spray for nose bleed prevention
   .
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 25-27, current hct 22
   - iron studies consistent with chronic disease
   - continue epogen
   - monitor; note that she recently had thoracentesis
   - guaiac stools
   # Depression:
   - Continue fluoxetine
   - patient currently declining SW communication
   - Started MVI and thiamine
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely from diuresis and poor free water intake.
   - encourage PO water intake

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and diabetes.
- She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
- The patient's condition is complicated by volume overload, leukocytosis, and recurrent pleural effusions.
- The plan includes continuing diuresis with metolazone and Lasix, considering dialysis as definitive treatment, and optimizing management of diastolic dysfunction.
- The patient's chronic kidney disease is being monitored, and she may require dialysis.
- The patient's diastolic dysfunction is related to dilated cardiomyopathy, and her blood pressure needs to be controlled.
- There is a coagulopathy with slightly elevated PTT and INR, and further investigation is needed.
- Anemia management includes continuing epogen and monitoring.
- The patient has depression, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypernatremia, all of which require ongoing management.
- ICU care includes regular nutrition, glycemic control, monitoring of lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and bowel regimen.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the hospital unit.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with CKD, diastolic dysfunction, and DM who is being
   transferred to the ICU with hypoxia in the setting of persistent b/l
   pleural effusions.
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely from volume overload and recurrence of pleural effusion in
   this woman with diastolic dysfunction and renal failure.  She has a
   leukocytosis, which developed after her thoracentesis, but no cough or
   fever to suggest pneumonia.
   - continue diuresis with metolazone and lasix for now as she does
   respond with increased urine output and Cr is trending down with
   diuresis
   - definitive treatment would be dialysis, and would argue that she has
   failed medical management given recurrent episodes of hypoxia
   - would hold off on further thoracentesis as fluid quickly
   reaccumulates and she is on ASA/plavix
   - low threshold to start Abx if she develops fever, hypothermia, or
   cough
   - optimize management of diastolic dysfunction as below
   # Chronic Kidney Disease:
   Her Cr during this hospital stay has essentially been at her baseline,
   yet she is significantly volume overloaded.
   - suspect patient is headed for dialysis, but will need to discuss
   timing of initiation; per renal over weekend, could start today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - continue sevelamer
   # Diastolic dysfunction:
   Patient has been reported to have dilated cardiomyopathy in the past,
   but it is her right ventricle and not her left that is dilated on Echo,
   and her EF is relatively preserved.  She also has PAD, which is a
   coronary equivalent.
   - carvedilol was increased to 37.5 [**Hospital1 **] for improved rate control
   - if BP remains elevated, would add further antihypertensives
   - continue amlodipine
   .
   # Coagulopathy:
   PTT and INR slightly elevated (40 and 1.3).  Per review of notes,
   patient's inhibitor screen is negative, UPEP is still pending.  SPEP
   was negative.
   - appreciate hem/onc recs
   - f/u UPEP
   - monitor coags
   - nasal spray for nose bleed prevention
   .
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 25-27, current hct 22
   - iron studies consistent with chronic disease
   - continue epogen
   - monitor; note that she recently had thoracentesis
   - guaiac stools
   # Depression:
   - Continue fluoxetine
   - patient currently declining SW communication
   - Started MVI and thiamine
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely from diuresis and poor free water intake.
   - encourage PO water intake
   - if Na continues to rise, will give D5W
   .
   # Peripheral artery disease:
   - monitor wounds
   - continue ASA, plavix
    .
   # DM:
   - continue lantus and SSI
   # Hypothyroidism:   continue home levothyroxine

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia in the setting of persistent bilateral pleural effusions. She has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and depression. The patient has been receiving diuretics for volume overload and has shown improvement in urine output and a decreasing creatinine level. However, she continues to have episodes of hypoxia. The assessment suggests that her hypoxia is most likely due to volume overload and recurrence of pleural effusion. 

The plan includes continuing diuresis with metolazone and lasix, considering dialysis as the definitive treatment due to failed medical management, holding off on further thoracentesis due to rapid reaccumulation of fluid, and optimizing management of diastolic dysfunction. 

Other medical issues include chronic kidney disease with significant volume overload, diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, coagulopathy with slightly elevated PTT and INR, anemia with baseline Hct of 25-27 and current Hct of 22, depression, hypernatremia likely from diuresis and poor free water intake, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. 

ICU care includes regular low-sodium diabetic diet, insulin for glycemic control, monitoring of wounds in peripheral artery disease, and continuation of"

Intra or extrapulmonary is possible
   Dead Space-Patient with reasonable air movement and no evidence of
   obstructive lung disease
   V/Q mismatch
this has been held as the most likely cause but etiology
   of this mis-match is still unclear.
   She needs
ABG on minimal O2 followed by ABG on FIO2 of 1.0

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and hypothermia. She has been treated for pneumonia but continues to have persistent hypoxemia despite the tapping of pleural fluid. The patient's initial presentation has been confusing, with hypothermia and hypoxemia being the dominant picture. The hypothermia has resolved, but the hypoxemia persists in the setting of bilateral pleural effusion.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing significant hypoxemia with an A-a gradient. This could be due to a shunt (either intra or extrapulmonary), dead space, or V/Q mismatch. Further investigations such as ABG on minimal O2 followed by ABG on FIO2 of 1.0 are needed to determine the exact cause. Definitive imaging of the lungs should also be done to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM).

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral transudative pleural effusions. Further examination and chest X-ray should be conducted. Liver-associated enzymes should also be monitored.

3. Hypothermia: The patient initially presented with hypothermia, which has now resolved. However, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's temperature.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and multiple comorbidities including depression, hypernatremia, peripheral artery disease (PAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia of unclear cause. The initial CT angiography (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism (PE) but revealed significant bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) indicative of pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on a furosemide (Lasix) drip for volume overload and diuresis, with improving creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have hypoxia, possibly due to V/Q mismatch, shunting, obstructive lung disease, interstitial disease, or pulmonary vascular disease. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Despite diuresis, the patient's creatinine levels are trending down. Ongoing management of CKD is necessary.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction. Treatment includes uptitration of carvedilol for rate control and further antihypertensive therapy if blood pressure remains elevated.
4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) is 25-27%, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and is receiving high-flow oxygen via a neb device. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 156/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is on a furosemide infusion of 14 mg/hour.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include worsening of the patient's hypoxemia, exacerbation of heart failure, and further deterioration of renal function. The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates ongoing hypoxemia, which may require further interventions such as increased oxygen delivery or mechanical ventilation. The patient's history of acute diastolic heart failure suggests that there is a risk of exacerbation, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema. Additionally, the patient's chronic renal failure may progress, resulting in further electrolyte imbalances or fluid overload. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these potential complications and optimize the patient's outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female admitted for hypoxia and hypothermia. She continues to have persistent and significant hypoxemia, with some improvement in the requirement for supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with acute diastolic dysfunction, hypoxemia, and chronic renal failure likely related to diabetes. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 153/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has been placed on diuretics with the goal of achieving a negative fluid balance. The patient's physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds in the bilateral lower lobes. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Imaging studies reveal no pulmonary embolism but show substantial bilateral lower lobe consolidations, effusions, diffuse ground glass opacities, micronodular infiltrates, and small nodules in the mid-right lung field. The patient's current plan includes continuing diuretics, holding further testing or procedures until after diuresis, providing incentive spirometry, and monitoring renal function.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and multiple comorbidities. She has been admitted to the ICU for persistent hypoxia, with a current SpO2 level of 88%. The initial CT angiography (CTA) showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), but revealed significant bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities (GGO), suggestive of pulmonary edema. There were also multiple patchy peribronchovascular nodules with surrounding ground-glass attenuation, which could represent superimposed respiratory bronchiolitis or other atypical infections.

The patient is currently being treated with a furosemide infusion to manage volume overload. Her creatinine level is trending down despite diuresis. She is also receiving sevelamer for chronic kidney disease, carvedilol for rate control, amlodipine for blood pressure management, epogen for anemia, fluoxetine for depression, and multivitamins and thiamine supplementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and GGO on CTA suggest ongoing respiratory compromise. This could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.

2. Infection: The presence of multiple patchy peribronchovascular nodules on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the ICU with poor urine output, loose stools, and an angry-looking rash on her bottom. Despite increasing Lasix and adding metolazone, her urine output remained low. She also continued to desaturate but felt well. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/54 to 153/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, slightly high platelet count, normal electrolyte levels except for high sodium, and normal liver function tests. Imaging reveals no evidence of pulmonary embolism but shows multifocal peribronchial opacities suggestive of evolving infectious bronchopneumonia, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and associated bibasilar atelectasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious bronchopneumonia: The multifocal peribronchial opacities seen on the chest CT scan suggest an evolving infectious process in the lungs. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of pneumonia, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Pleural effusions: The presence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions indicates fluid accumulation in the"

   mismatch
shunting.  Ddx includes obstructive lung disease, interstitial
   disease, and pulmonary vascular disease.  CTA yesterday was negative
   for PE, but showed significant bilateral pleural effusions and GGO
   (indicative of pulmonary edema).  We will continue treating for volume
   overload, while pursuing other causes for significant and persistent
   hypoxia as we get rid of fluid.  Lasix drip turned off as patient not
   putting out urine; not sure if [**2-12**] renal decline from contrast versus
   patient now dry.
   - continue diuresis with lasix drip for now as making some headway and
   Cr trending down
   - appreciate renal recommendations in regard to dialysis for volume
   overload.
   # Chronic Kidney Disease:  Creatinine was trending down with diuresis.
   Now increased, likely [**2-12**] contrast load.
   - Continue to trend
   - Continue sevelamer
   # Diastolic dysfunction:
   Billed as having dilated cardiomyopathy, although ECHO does not support
   this diagnosis.
   - carvedilol was increased to 37.5 [**Hospital1 **] for improved rate control ->
   will continue to uptitrate as tolerated
   - if BP remains elevated, would add further antihypertensives
   - continue amlodipine

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and other comorbidities such as depression, hypernatremia, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia and findings of pulmonary edema on imaging. The patient has been receiving treatment for volume overload, including diuretics and fluid restriction. Her urine output has been poor, with only 10 cc/hr, leading to the discontinuation of the Lasix drip. The patient also has loose stools and an angry-looking rash on her bottom. Her vital signs show a low-grade fever, decreased breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles, and a soft systolic murmur. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated creatinine levels, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal multifocal peribronchial opacities in the right lung suggestive of evolving infectious bronchopneumonia, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, associated bibasilar atelectasis, and anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body. Microbiology results for pleural fluid are pending. The patient's assessment includes hypoxia, chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, anemia, coagulopathy, and other ongoing medical issues. The plan involves continuing diuresis with Lasix, considering renal recommendations for dialysis, managing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and peripheral artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia. The patient's urine output has been poor throughout the day, despite increasing the Lasix drip and adding metolazone. Her stools have been loose, and she has developed an angry-looking rash on her bottom. The patient feels well but is frustrated with the lack of progress. She has no appetite.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/54 to 153/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is receiving aerosol-cool oxygen at 60% FiO2.

On physical examination, the patient appears pleasant and alert, with conjunctival pallor. Her neck is supple, and her lungs show decreased breath sounds at the bases with scattered crackles. No wheezing is noted. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly. She has a history of amputations on both feet and some eschar.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and sodium levels. Her creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating possible renal decline."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and peripheral artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia and found to have multifocal peribronchial opacities in the right lung, suggesting infectious bronchopneumonia. The patient also has moderate bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis, with the left side being more affected than the right. Additionally, there is slight anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body, possibly at T11 or T12.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely caused by a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. Other possible causes include obstructive lung disease, interstitial disease, and pulmonary vascular disease. The CT scan showed significant bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, as well as nodules/interstitial changes that could be consistent with atypical infection versus sarcoidosis.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has poor urine output, which suggests volume overload. The Lasix drip was increased but eventually stopped because the patient was only putting out about 10 cc/hr.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, likely due to a contrast load. There is a plan for dialysis initiation tomorrow.

4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has diastolic dysfunction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female admitted with significant hypoxemia following hypothermia.
- The hypoxemia may be related to an acute infectious process.
- The patient has persistent volume overload and poor urine output.
- There are pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates with ground glass and nodular opacities, as well as basilar collapse and effusions leading to poor V/Q matching.
- The patient will continue with incentive spirometry, chest PT, and ABX.
- The patient has chronic renal failure, with plans to follow the exam and discuss renal timing for diuresis.
- There is a history of acute diastolic heart failure, euvolemia, and maximum diuresis.
- The patient also has a history of peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, hypernatremia, hypoxemia, and poor PO intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not adequately managed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's impaired kidney function can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, leading to further complications if not properly managed.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of acute diastolic heart failure indicates an increased risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's history of PVD without critical limb ischemia suggests a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia, and her condition has been complicated by several factors. The patient has been on a lasix drip but has had poor urine output, leading to the decision for dialysis. A tunneled HD catheter was placed yesterday, and she underwent dialysis today. The patient also has chronic anemia, depression, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which could be due to V/Q mismatch or shunting. Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis were seen on the CT scan.
2. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing despite diuresis, suggesting a possible contrast-induced nephropathy.
3. Dialysis complications: Since the patient underwent dialysis, there is a risk of complications such as hypotension, infection at the catheter site, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has diastolic dysfunction and right-sided dilated cardiomyopathy. There is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and ongoing monitoring and management of iron levels and erythrop"

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and other medical conditions including depression, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was transferred to the ICU for persistent hypoxia, which is likely due to a V/Q mismatch or shunting. A CT angiogram showed bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, ground glass opacities, and micronodular infiltrates. The patient's urine output has been poor, and she is currently undergoing hemodialysis through an IR-guided tunneled HD catheter. 

Her renal function has been trending upwards despite diuresis, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Her Hct level is slightly decreased, and she has iron deficiency anemia consistent with chronic disease. She has been given one dose of IV iron and will receive a blood transfusion during her next dialysis session if her Hct continues to trend down. She is also taking epogen and guaiac stools are being monitored. 

The patient's other medications include statin, ASA, plavix, carvedilol, amlodipine, fluoxetine, MVI, and thiamine. Her nutrition consists of a regular low-sodium diet, and her glycemic control is managed with insulin SS and lantus. She is at risk for DVT and stress ulcers, but prophylaxis for these conditions has been stopped due to bleeding."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They have a history of chronic renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/44 to 150/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 58 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 160 mL, output of 101 mL, and a negative balance of 59 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has normal ABG results.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, and some laboratory values are incomplete. The labs show elevated potassium levels of 445 K/uL, low hemoglobin at 7.5 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 107 mg/dL, normal creatinine at 4.9 mg/dL, low sodium at 29 mEq/L, and elevated potassium at 81 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated platelet count. Microbiology results from the pleural fluid and cultures are negative for any growth.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and multiple comorbidities, including depression, peripheral artery disease (PAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and anemia. She was admitted to the ICU for persistent hypoxia, and further evaluation revealed significant bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, ground glass opacities, and micronodular infiltrates. The patient has been started on dialysis and is planned to receive a tunneled HD catheter. Her renal function has not improved despite diuresis, and there are concerns about contrast-induced nephropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch or shunting, which can be exacerbated by her underlying lung conditions. Close monitoring of oxygenation and repeated chest imaging as more fluid is removed during dialysis will be important.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's CKD is worsening despite diuretic therapy, and there are concerns about contrast-induced nephropathy. Continued monitoring of renal function and ongoing discussion with the renal team for further management are necessary.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has diastolic dysfunction associated with right-sided dilated cardiomyopathy. Medications such as statins, ASA, and Coreg will be continued, and careful monitoring of rate control"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia and renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving aggressive pulmonary therapy and mobilization to improve oxygenation. He also has a history of chronic renal failure, for which he will undergo dialysis today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/51 to 74/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals thin appearance, symmetric chest expansion, dullness to percussion, crackles and diminished breath sounds bilaterally, soft non-tender abdomen, and mild lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium and creatinine levels, and other electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. If not addressed promptly, it can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure requires ongoing management, including dialysis to remove waste products and maintain electrolyte balance. If not properly managed, it can lead to further deterioration of renal function and complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.
3. Volume Overload: The presence of bilateral lower lobe"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and peripheral artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia, and a CT angiography revealed significant bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, ground glass opacities, and micronodular infiltrates. The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday and showed improvement with decreased pleural effusions on chest X-ray.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 145/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Her physical examination reveals decreased lung sounds at the bases and crackles on the right side, normal heart sounds, and a flat affect. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, blood glucose, and lactic acid. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The cause of hypoxia is unclear, but it is likely due to V/Q mismatch, shunting, bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis. The patient's condition improved after hemodialysis, and further evaluation is needed.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease: Despite initial improvement with diuresis, the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diastolic dysfunction, and peripheral artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia, and further evaluation revealed significant bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, ground glass opacities, and micronodular infiltrates. The patient underwent hemodialysis successfully, with a liter of fluid removed. Her creatinine levels are increasing, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. She has a history of depression, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and peripheral artery disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has decreased lung sounds at the bases with crackles on the right lower lobe. She also has right-sided dilated cardiomyopathy with normal ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's decreased lung sounds and crackles suggest possible pneumonia or atelectasis. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions may contribute to compromised respiratory function.
2. Renal complications: The patient's increasing creatinine levels indicate worsening kidney function, which could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy. This may require adjustments in her treatment plan and further monitoring.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has diastolic dysfunction and right-sided dilated cardiomyopathy. These conditions can lead to heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) without any complications. The vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 64-83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/48 mmHg to 145/51 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 58 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 150 mL and a total output of 1315 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1165 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of //30/. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to assessments not being performed on various body systems.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with CKD, diastolic dysfunction, and [**Hospital **] transferred to the
   unit in the setting of persistent hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:  Unclear cause of hypoxia, but most likely from V/Q
   mismatch
shunting.  CTA showed significant bilateral pleural effusions
   and compressive atelectasis, as well as ground glass opacities and
   micronodular infiltrates.  Patient had been on lasix drip, but given
   poor urine output the decision was made to go for dialysis.
   - IR-guided tunneled HD catheter placed and dialysis was successfully
   undertaken yesterday with (1 liter taken off)
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - CXR this AM looks like decreased pleural effusions bilaterally
   - Encourage OOB to chair
   - Incentive spirometer
   # Chronic Kidney Disease:  Although creatinine initially trended down
   with diuresis, it
s going up now (?contrast induced nephropathy).
   - Next HD tomorrow

   - Continue to trend cr and electrolytes
   - Renal following
   - Trend creatinine
   # Diastolic dysfunction: Rt sided dilated cardiomyopathy, normal EF.
   - Statin/ASA/plavix
   - Coreg was increased to 37.5 [**Hospital1 **] for improved rate control; continue
   at current dose
well rate controlled at 69 in sinus this AM

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diastolic dysfunction, and other comorbidities such as depression, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and positive PPD.

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypoxia and subsequent findings of significant bilateral pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, ground glass opacities, and micronodular infiltrates on computed tomography angiography (CTA). She underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) during the procedure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate (HR) of 73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 114/48 mmHg to 145/51 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on nasal cannula. Her weight is stable at 58 kg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a trend upward, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), increased serum creatinine (Cr), and electrolyte imbalances including hyperkalemia (K+), hypocalcemia (Ca++), and hypomagnesemia (Mg++). Other lab results include elevated lactate levels, decreased total CO2 (TCO2), and normal glucose levels. The PT/PTT/INR values are elevated, indicating prolonged clotting times.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, likely caused by ventilation-perfusion mismatch, shunting, and other pulmonary issues identified on CTA. She also has chronic kidney disease, which initially showed improvement with diuresis but is now worsening, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient will undergo another HD session tomorrow and will continue with sevelamer (phosphate binder) and monitoring of renal function.

In terms of medication, the patient is on a statin, aspirin, and clopidogrel for diastolic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors. Coreg has been increased to 37.5 mg to improve heart rate control, and she will continue with amlodipine. Iron studies are consistent with chronic disease, and she has been given IV iron and PRBCs during HD. Epoetin alpha (epogen) will be continued.

Other assessments and plans include anemia, depression, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and PPD. The patient's Foley catheter will be discontinued, and she will be called out to the floor today."

   60 yof respiratory distress and hypoxemia, attributed to CHF in context
   of anuric renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to hypoxemia and CHF (volume
   overload).  Much improved, esp. following dialysis.  Continue to
   monitor RR, SaO2.
   HYPOxEMIA -- attributed to CHF in context of volume overload.
   Improved.  Monitor SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.
   CHF -- likely diastolic dysfunction (LVH).  Consider echo to assess
   diastolic and systolic function, valvular heart disease.
   RENAL FAILURE -- chronic, with progressive decompensation.  Now on
   hemodialysis.  Continue per Renal HD schedule.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with respiratory distress and hypoxemia attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) in the context of anuric renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory distress and hypoxemia, especially after undergoing dialysis. His respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of prolonged hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia suggest a potential risk for respiratory failure if his oxygenation does not improve or if he develops further complications.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of an enlarged left ventricle (LVH) increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Infection: Immunosuppressed patients are at higher risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper infection control measures should be implemented to minimize this risk.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and underlying conditions increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and systemic antico"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yof respiratory distress and hypoxemia, attributed to CHF in context
   of anuric renal failure.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to hypoxemia and CHF (volume
   overload)
   HYPOxEMIA -- attributed to CHF in context of volume overload.
   CHF -- likely diastolic dysfuction.  Consider echo.
   RENAL FAILURE -- chronic, with progressive decompensation.  Now on
   hemodialysis.  Continue per schedule.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with respiratory distress and hypoxemia attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) in the context of anuric renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and on hemodialysis. There have been no new symptoms reported, and the patient's supplemental oxygen requirements continue to decline. The patient tolerated hemodialysis yesterday without any issues. There are no known drug allergies. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted respiratory distress and hypoxemia. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of overweight or obesity. The patient has normal head and neck examination, normal cardiovascular examination except for diminished peripheral pulses, normal respiratory examination with scattered crackles in the lungs, and no abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system. The patient's neurologic examination is also normal. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory distress and hypoxemia attributed to CHF in the context of volume overload. The patient also has chronic renal failure with progressive decompensation, for which he is currently on hemodialysis. The plan is to continue with scheduled hemodialysis, consider an echocardi"
