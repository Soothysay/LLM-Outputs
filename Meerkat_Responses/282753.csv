   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. Consider ischemic versus non-ischemic causes
   (diabetes, hypertension, tachycardia, metabolic, hemochromatosis,
   viral). S/p diltiazem IV, metoprolol IV, amiodarone in the ED with
   continued RVR and mild hypotension. Digoxin loaded overnight for rate
   control. HR
s in 140s-160s and SBP
s in 80s-90s overnight;
   asymptomatic. RR in 20s, believed due to tachycardia/hypotension
   picture.
   - plan for TEE cardioversion this morning; call anesthesia and TEE
   - continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete
   - closely monitor HR & BP & RR
   - CHADS score calculated to be 2 (hypertension and diabetes), warrants
   anticoagulation. continue IV heparin for bridge to coumadin
   - if rate control is ineffective or patient becomes unstable, will
   consider, TEE/cardioversion emergently followed by heparin gtt bridge
   to warfarin
   - f/u full set of LFT

   - f/u CE

   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV. Unclear
   if this is a primary problem, possibly viral cardiomyopathy, secondary
   to hypertension, diabetes, metabolic disorder, or secondary to a.fib
   with RVR for unknown period of time, i.e. tachycardia-induced.

   - monitor pressures
   - hold antihypertensive medication for now (HCTZ 50mg PO daily,
   verapamil 180mg ST PO daily)
   - lasix 40mg IV once for diuresis now; feel volume-overload issue is
   greater than hypotension issue presently

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive daily progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**]
   today and I agree with the history, physical examination, assessment
   and plan.  I was present during the physical examination and concur
   with its findings.
   Addendum to the History:  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**]
s note.  Also he has no
   complains, he is clearly breathless and working to breath.
   Addendum to Physical Examination:  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**]
s Note.  He is
   tachypneic at rest.  He has 3+ pedal edema.
   Medical Decision Making.  Mr. [**Known lastname 2333**] is a 65 year old man who was
   admitted for treatment of a new onset cardiomyopathy, cough and
   weakness.  He was given 2.5 L volume for resuscitation for hypotension
   and developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response
   (130-150).  He has been given multiple agents (metoprolol
   hypotension; diltiazen
 hypotension) without success but has now
   tolerated amiodarone 150 mg IV x 2 and an IV amiodarone load (2 gram
   over 24 hours).
   We have begun vigorous diuresis and he has responded nicely (>200-300
   cc per hour).  A total of three attempts at DC cardioversion have
   resulting in transient sinus rhythm but reversion to atrial
   fibrillation with a rapid response.
   The total time for this visit was 40 minutes and over 50% of the time
   was spent coordinating care and discussing case with the patient and
   family.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. The patient was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle.

The patient has been treated with various medications including diltiazem IV, metoprolol IV, amiodarone in the emergency department, and digoxin loaded overnight for rate control. Despite these treatments, the patient continues to have RVR and mild hypotension. The plan for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) cardioversion this morning has been made, and the patient is to continue digoxin 0.125 mg orally now that the load is complete.

The patient's cardiomyopathy is characterized by a new-found EF of 20% with globally dilated right ventricle. It is unclear whether this is a primary problem, possibly viral cardiomyopathy, secondary to hypertension, diabetes, metabolic disorder, or secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR for an unknown period of time, i.e., tachycardia-induced. Rate control as above, diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix now, and monitoring intake/output are planned.

The patient's blood pressure is running low secondary"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Currently does not feel symptomatic.
   Unclear if this episode is new or has been longer with no symptoms.
   However, given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo, may be related to
   dilation from novel cardiomyopathy. However, must rule out possible
   hyperthyroidism (TSH wnl) or thiamine deficiency. No signs of ischemia
   s/p diltiazem IV push times three and metoprolol IV push times one
   without effect and decrease in blood pressure. Was started on amio in
   the ED with continued RVR and mild hypotension. Digoxin loaded
   overnight for rate control. HR
s in 140s-160s and SBP
s in 80s-90s
   overnight; asymptomatic.
   - plan for TEE cardioversion today
   - continue digoxin
   - closely monitor HR & BP
   - CHADS score calculated to be 2 (hypertension and diabetes), warrants
   anticoagulation. continue IV heparin bridge to coumadin.
   - if rate control is ineffective or patient becomes unstable, will
   consider, TEE/cardioversion emergently followed by warfarin
   - f/u thiamine
   - f/u ekg and CEs to eval for any ischemia
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: Newly found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.
   Unclear if this is a primary problem, possibly viral cardiomyopathy, or
   secondary to a.fib with RVR for unknown period of time, i.e.
   tachycardia induced.
   -Rate control as above
   -once BP stabilizes, plan to gently diurese, possibly lasix drip
   -ACE/BB once BP stabilizes

   # HTN: Blood pressures running low secondary to rapid ventricular rate,
   poor diastolic filling, many nodal agents,  and low cardiac output.
   Given small 250cc NS boluses o/n.
   - monitor pressures
   - hold antihypertensive medication for now (HCTZ 50mg PO daily,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. The patient was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 151 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64/48 mmHg to 112/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is tachycardic and has irregular heart rhythm. Physical examination reveals pedal edema and rales at the right base.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, troponin T, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are also within normal limits.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, diltiazem IV, metoprolol IV, amiodarone, and digoxin. The plan is to perform transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) cardioversion today, continue digoxin, and closely monitor heart rate and blood pressure. Anticoagulation with IV heparin bridge to coumadin is continued due to a CHADS score of 2. If rate control is ineffective or the patient becomes unstable, emergent TEE/cardioversion followed by warfarin will be considered.

Other plans include following up on thiamine, evaluating for any ischemia on EKG and cardiac enzymes, rate control, and diuresis once blood pressure stabilizes. The patient's hypertension is being monitored, and antihypertensive medications will be held for now. Hyperlipidemia management involves increasing simvastatin to 80mg daily. Outpatient diabetes medications are being held during admission, and insulin sliding scale will be continued. The patient's arthritis and gout are stable, and prophylaxis with heparin drip is ongoing."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient underwent cardioversion twice without success, and amiodarone is being given at a rate of 1 mg/min for a total load of 4-21 g.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Heart failure: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle suggest a cardiomyopathy, which may progress to heart failure if not managed properly.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation has not responded to cardioversion attempts and is being managed with medications like amiodarone. There is a risk of recurrent or new-onset arrhythmias.

3. Thromboembolism: Due to the atrial fibrillation, there is an increased risk of thrombus formation in the heart, which can lead to embolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.

4. Malignancy: The elevated LDH level and the presence of a large lymph node in the right axilla raise concerns for malignancy. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of these findings.

5. Anemia: The patient's H"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x2, amio
   gtt.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. Consider ischemic versus non-ischemic causes
   (diabetes, hypertension, tachycardia, metabolic, hemochromatosis,
   viral). S/p diltiazem IV, metoprolol IV, amiodarone in the ED with
   continued RVR and mild hypotension. Digoxin loaded overnight for rate
   control. HR
s in 140s-160s and SBP
s in 80s-90s overnight;
   asymptomatic. RR in 20s, believed due to tachycardia/hypotension
   picture.
   - continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete, continue IV
   Amiodarone gtt
   - closely monitor HR & BP & RR
   - CHADS score calculated to be 2 (hypertension and diabetes), warrants
   anticoagulation. continue IV heparin for bridge to coumadin
   - if rate control is ineffective or patient becomes unstable, will
   consider cardioversion again
   - f/u CE
s to evaluate for any ischemia
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV. Unclear
   if this is a primary problem, possibly viral cardiomyopathy, secondary
   to hypertension, diabetes, metabolic disorder, or secondary to a.fib
   with RVR for unknown period of time, i.e. tachycardia-induced.
   -rate control as above
   -volume-overloaded, so diuresis with 40mg IV lasix now
   -monitor I
s & O
   -ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures running low secondary to rapid ventricular rate,
   poor diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   Given gentle 250cc NS boluses o/n.
   - monitor pressures
   - hold antihypertensive medication for now (HCTZ 50mg PO daily,
   verapamil 180mg ST PO daily)
   - lasix 40mg IV once for diuresis now; feel volume-overload issue is
   greater than hypotension issue presently
   .
   # LE edema: L>R today, whereas edema had been equal in the past.  Will
   obtain LE Doppler to r/o DVT.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable but approximately 10 points below baseline.
   Concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   - follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u blood smear
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - continue insulin sliding scale, will start long-acting insulin today
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - can continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
- He presented with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV).
- He underwent cardioversion twice but remained in atrial fibrillation.
- The patient was started on amiodarone gtt for rate control and to prevent further arrhythmias.
- He also received diltiazem IV, metoprolol IV, and digoxin loaded overnight for rate control, but remained symptomatic with a heart rate in the 140s-160s and blood pressure in the 80s-90s.
- His respiratory rate was in the 20s, believed due to tachycardia/hypotension picture.
- The patient's condition was stable overnight.
- The plan is to continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that the load is complete, continue IV amiodarone gtt, and closely monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
- CHADS score calculated to be 2, warrants anticoagulation. Continue IV heparin for bridge to coumadin.
- If rate control is ineffective or the patient becomes unstable, consider cardioversion"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x2, amio
   gtt.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.
   - continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete
   - continue IV Amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min for total load of [**4-21**] g (will
   be at goal [**11-3**] AM)
   - closely monitor HR & BP & RR
   - CHADS score calculated to be 2 (hypertension and diabetes), warrants
   anticoagulation. continue IV heparin for bridge to coumadin
   - if rate control is ineffective or patient becomes unstable, will
   consider cardioversion again
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced
   -rate control as above
   -volume-overloaded, continue diuresis with lasix gtt and boluses of 40
   IV as needed to reach goal of negative 2-3 liters today
   -monitor I
s & O
   -ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures running low secondary to rapid ventricular rate,
   poor diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   - monitor pressures
   - diuresis as above.
   .
   # Elevated LDH: initially concerning for ischemia in the context of
   afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation and finding of R
   axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for malignancy.
   -[**Doctor First Name 213**] consult for lymph node biopsy today
   -will get imaging based on [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs.
   -will notify onc if indicated based on tissue dx
   .
   # LE edema: LE doppler negative.  Most likely due to pts heart failure.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable but approximately 10 points below baseline.
   Concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   - follow Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - continue insulin sliding scale, adjust glargine dose based on short

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
- He presented with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle.
- The patient underwent cardioversion twice but did not respond, so amiodarone and digoxin are being continued.
- The patient has a CHADS score of 2, indicating the need for anticoagulation.
- The patient is also being treated for heart failure with diuretics and ACE/BB once blood pressure stabilizes.
- He has elevated levels of LDH, which initially suggested ischemia but now raises concern for malignancy due to the presence of right axillary lymphadenopathy.
- A consultation for lymph node biopsy has been requested.
- The patient has leg edema likely due to heart failure.
- His hemoglobin concentration is stable but approximately 10 points below baseline, which may indicate anemia of chronic disease.
- His cholesterol levels are not well controlled, and simvastatin is being continued.
- His diabetes management involves holding outpatient medications during this admission and adjusting insulin doses as needed.
- His arthritis and gout are stable, and he can continue taking allopurinol.
- The patient's ICU care includes heart-healthy nutrition and"

 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x5, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete
   - Continue IV Amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min, switched to 0.5mg/min now
   that pt converted to sinus on 1mg/min (total load of [**4-21**] g as of [**11-3**]
   AM)
   - Continue Heparin bridge, transition to Coumadin in the future once
   stable and pending decision re: procedures/biopsy.  CHADS score 2
   (hypertension and diabetes).
   -Continue Lasix diuresis to optimize pt staying in sinus
   - Esmolol IV 500mg boluses as needed and tolerated to control HR if in
   sinus
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly as pt has
   L-sided extremity and confusion this morning.
   - CT head w/ contrast
   - Consider MRI with gad in future for metastasis w/u once patient
   stable
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent with melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   - Surgery consult for lymph node biopsy
   - Will notify Oncology though no tissue diagnosis yet

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient has undergone multiple cardioversions without success and has shown spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm on amiodarone, but has since reverted back to atrial fibrillation. 

The patient is currently on digoxin, amiodarone, and diuretics for management of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. He also has an elevated LDH level, which is concerning for malignancy. Imaging studies reveal multiple subcutaneous nodules with larger necrotic masses in the right axilla and further nodules in the left perinephric region, highly suspicious for metastases, possible melanoma. A biopsy of the right axillary lymph node is recommended. 

The patient also has a moderately large pericardial effusion in the presence of moderate cardiomegaly. Additionally, there are subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver and lower pole of the left kidney, which could be cysts. 

The patient's neurological changes are concerning for metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS or a thromboembolic event. Further evaluation with CT head w/ contrast and possibly MRI with"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x5, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete
   - Continue IV Amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min, switched to 0.5mg/min now
   that pt converted to sinus on 1mg/min (total load of [**4-21**] g as of [**11-3**]
   AM)
   - Continue Heparin bridge, transition to Coumadin in the future once
   stable and pending decision re: procedures/biopsy.  CHADS score 2
   (hypertension and diabetes).
   -Continue Lasix diuresis to optimize pt staying in sinus
   - Esmolol IV 500mg boluses as needed and tolerated to control HR if in
   sinus
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly as pt has
   L-sided extremity and confusion this morning.
   - CT head w/ contrast
   - Consider MRI with gad in future for metastasis w/u once patient
   stable
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent with melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   - Surgery consult for lymph node biopsy
   - Will notify Oncology though no tissue diagnosis yet
   - IP re: possible US guided thoracentesis of loculated large L pleural
   effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt and boluses of 40 IV as needed to
   reach goal of negative 2-3 liters today
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE.  LE
   doppler negative.  Most likely [**2-19**] heart failure.
   - Arterial duplex to r/o cholesterol emboli vs. thromboembolic event
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures running low secondary to rapid ventricular rate,
   poor diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's persistent AFib and RVR pose a risk of further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or heart failure due to the decreased cardiac output.

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a globally dilated right ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction, which suggests the possibility of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. This condition can lead to heart failure and may require ongoing management with diuretics and other cardiac support measures.

3. Neurological Changes: The patient's confusion and left-sided extremity weakness raise concerns about potential metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS or a thromboembolic event. Further investigations like CT head with contrast and possibly an MRI in the future will help determine the underlying cause.

4. Elevated LDH: The significantly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are concerning for possible malignancy. Given the findings of right axillary lymphadenopathy and CT torso consistent with melanoma vs. lymphoma, a tissue diagnosis through lymph node biopsy is necessary to confirm the presence of malignancy.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures indicate possible hypotension, which may be secondary to rapid ventricular rate, poor diastolic filling, use of multiple nodal"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x5, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete
   - Continue IV Amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min, switched to 0.5mg/min now
   that pt converted to sinus on 1mg/min (total load of [**4-21**] g as of [**11-3**]
   AM)
   - Continue Heparin bridge, transition to Coumadin in the future once
   stable and pending decision re: procedures/biopsy.  CHADS score 2
   (hypertension and diabetes).
   -Continue Lasix diuresis to optimize pt staying in sinus
   - Esmolol IV 500mg boluses as needed and tolerated to control HR if in
   sinus
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly as pt has
   L-sided extremity and confusion this morning.
   - CT head w/ contrast
   - Consider MRI with gad in future for metastasis w/u once patient
   stable
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent with melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   - Surgery consult for lymph node biopsy
   - Will notify Oncology though no tissue diagnosis yet
   - IP re: possible US guided thoracentesis of loculated large L pleural
   effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt and boluses of 40 IV as needed to
   reach goal of negative 2-3 liters today
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE.  LE
   doppler negative.  Most likely [**2-19**] heart failure.
   - Arterial duplex to r/o cholesterol emboli vs. thromboembolic event
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures running low secondary to rapid ventricular rate,
   poor diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with symptoms such as malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. The patient was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He underwent cardioversion multiple times but did not respond initially. However, he spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on amiodarone and later converted back to atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which may be due to novel cardiomyopathy. Despite multiple attempts at cardioversion, he has not responded. However, his heart rate has improved with digoxin, amiodarone, and diuretics. He spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday but converted back to atrial fibrillation this morning. Amiodarone drip was re-initiated, and he subsequently converted to sinus rhythm.

2. Neurologic changes: The patient has left-sided extremity weakness and confusion. There is a concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS or a thromboembolic event. Further investigations such as a CT head with contrast and possibly an MRI with gadolinium in the future are planned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms including malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle. The patient has undergone multiple cardioversions without success, spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on amiodarone, but has since reverted back to atrial fibrillation with RVR. He is currently experiencing hypotension, febrile with a temperature of 100.6°F, and has a large pleural effusion concerning for malignancy or empyema. The patient also has an axillary lymph node and neurologic changes including left-sided extremity weakness and confusion. Laboratory findings show elevated LDH levels and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: The patient's persistent atrial fibrillation with RVR poses a risk for further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to atrial fibrillation with RVR, infection/sepsis, or heart failure. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Elevated LDH levels: The significantly elevated LDH levels suggest possible tissue breakdown or"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   - D/c digoxin due to renal failure
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - No coumadin as want to have flexibility regarding procedures
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis. On
   pressors.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - rate control with amiodarone
   - for infection
 see fevers bulletpoint below
   - Check CVP
   - Consider swan
   - Consider TTE
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus PNA given L pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
   - f/u tap of L pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   - f/u  peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - f/u LN biopsy results
   - f/u L pleural effusion results
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid
   - f/u oncology recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 5 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets rose today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if plts continue to down-trend
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr jumped from approximately 1 to 2.0 today.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Send urine electrolytes
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt and boluses of 40 IV as needed to
   reach goal of negative 2 liters today
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Most likely [**2-19**]
   heart failure.
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures low secondary to rapid ventricular rate, poor
   diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 today
   - diuresis w/lasix

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Weaning off the ventilator will be considered as tolerated.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with RVR, which has not responded to cardioversion attempts. Amiodarone has been initiated and digoxin was discontinued due to renal failure.

3. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to atrial fibrillation with RVR and/or infection/sepsis. Pressors have been initiated, and the CVP will be monitored. A swan-Ganz catheterization may be considered to assess cardiac function and fluid status.

4. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, which could be due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases or a pulmonary infection. Further investigations such as flow cytometry and cytology of the left pleural effusion, oncology recommendations, and FNA biopsy results are pending.

5. Neurologic Changes: There are concerns for metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS or a thromboembolic event given the patient's atrial fibrillation, particularly with recent left-sided extremity weakness and confusion. Mental status will be closely monitored.

6. Elevated LDH: The patient has an elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
   - Continue digoxin 0.125mg po now that load complete, and digoxin level
   therapeutic at 1.4
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis.  Most
   likely source of infection PNA given L pleural effusion concerning for
   malignancy vs. empyema/PNA.  CEs flat, no acute EKG changes.
   - F/u tap of L pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn; considering broadening coverage given fever
   spike again o/n
   - Cortisol level to assess whether steroids would help BP - elevated
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   - f/u  peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - f/u LN biopsy results
   - f/u L pleural effusion results
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 5 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets rose today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if plts continue to down-trend
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr jumped from approximately 1 to 2.0 today.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Send urine electrolytes
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt and boluses of 40 IV as needed to
   reach goal of negative 2 liters today
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Most likely [**2-19**]
   heart failure.
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures low secondary to rapid ventricular rate, poor
   diastolic filling, many nodal agents, and low cardiac output.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Continue simvastatin 80mg PO daily
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress, which could be caused by a lung infection or pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is likely due to a novel cardiomyopathy. The patient has undergone multiple cardioversions without success. It is important to continue antiarrhythmic medication and anticoagulation therapy to manage the AFib.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, possibly secondary to AFib with RVR, infection/sepsis, or heart failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is essential.

4. Neurologic changes: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and there is concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS or a thromboembolic event. Further evaluation, such as imaging studies and laboratory tests, may be necessary.

5. Elevated LDH: The patient has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, which is concerning for malignancy. Additional investigations, such as flow cytometry, lymph node biopsy, and pleural fluid analysis, are needed to determine the cause.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet"

   CT neck:
   1. Paranasal sinus opacification, as detailed, with high-density
   contents of
   the right sphenoid sinus, could reflect inspissated secretions or
   fungal infection.
   2. Debris and aerosolized secretions within the nasal cavity and
   nasopharynx.
   3. Slight asymmetry of the lingual tonsils, left slightly more
   prominent
   compared to the right, wo/obvious mass. Recommend correlation w/exam
   findings.
   4. Nodule within the subcutaneous fat lateral to the right mandibular
   body.
   5. Large left pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis of adjacent
   lung.
   -Assymetry of the right nasopharynx may be positional but could also be
   related
   to an underlying mass, recommend dedicated CT of the sinuses.
   CT head:
   1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   2. Enhancing extra-axial lesions overlying the right frontal lobe, and
   also
   possibly overlying the left frontal lobe along the superior convexity.
   These
   could reflect meningiomas, though given the provided history,
   metastases
   cannot be excluded.
   3. Asymmetric appearance of the cavernous sinus, with prominence and
   fullness
   of the right cavernous sinus, may represent another meningioma. An
   underlying
   mass or vascular lesion cannot be entirely excluded. An MRI is
   suggested for
   further evaluation.
   4. Paranasal sinus opacification, with high-density contents within the

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. The patient has been in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He underwent multiple cardioversions without success and spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on amiodarone, but later reverted back to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient is currently intubated for respiratory distress and has a white-out of the left lung. He has had episodes of fever and is suspected to have a malignant neoplasm, possibly melanoma or lymphoma. The patient also has hypotension and is on pressors. There are concerns for infection or sepsis, as well as B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases versus pneumonia given the left pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology. 

The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine from approximately 1 to 2.0 today. There are concerns for metastasis of malignancy affecting the CNS versus thromboembolic event given atrial fibrillation, particularly with recent left-sided extremity weakness and confusion. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia and is being monitored closely for HIT type I vs II. He has cardiomyopathy with a new-found ejection fraction of 20%"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u  peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - f/u LN biopsy results
   - f/u L pleural effusion results
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   - f/u oncology recs
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis, but
   improved since yesterday. On pressors.  CVP 7 this AM.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue Amiodarone for rate control, though patient unlikely to
   convert to sinus given persistent a fib with failure to cardiovert and
   maintain in sinus
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   - Float swan today, will consider diuresis based on pressure readings.
   - Bolus to keep CVP at >8
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus PNA given L pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
   - f/u tap of L pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   Digoxin d/c
ed due to renal failure.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - No coumadin as want to have flexibility regarding procedures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr jumped from approximately 1 to 2.0 today.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   - try to decrease sedation and examine patient today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 8 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets increased yesterday but back down
   today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt with goal CVP >8
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema b/l
   today. Most likely [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Change simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in -patient
   - uptitrate insulin today
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient underwent multiple cardioversions without success, spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm once, but has since reverted back to atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and/or infection/sepsis. The CVP is currently at 7, and the plan is to wean off pressors as tolerated.
2. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, which could be due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases, pleural effusion, or other infectious etiology. Further investigations are pending, including a tap of the left pleural effusion for flow cytometry and cytology.
3. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation that has not responded to multiple cardioversions. He has been on amiodarone, digoxin, and diuretics but remains in atrial fibrillation.

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.

   - f/u LN biopsy results
   - f/u L pleural effusion results
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs

   - f/u oncology recs
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis, but
   improved since yesterday. On pressors.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - rate control with amiodarone
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   - Check CVP
   - float swan today, will consider diuresis based on pressure readings.
   - Consider TTE
   -bolus to keep CVP at >8
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus PNA given L pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
   - f/u tap of L pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   - D/c digoxin due to renal failure
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - No coumadin as want to have flexibility regarding procedures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr jumped from approximately 1 to 2.0 today.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Send urine electrolytes
   - d/c digoxin
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   - try to decrease sedation and examine patient today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 5 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets rose today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt with goal CVP of 15-18
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema b/l
   today. Most likely [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Change simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity
   - Check LFT
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in -patient
   - uptitrate insulin today
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was found to have markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient underwent cardioversion multiple times but did not respond. He spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on amiodarone but reverted back to atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated for respiratory distress.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Elevated LDH: The patient has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, which can be concerning for malignancy. Further investigation is needed to confirm this suspicion.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and/or infection/sepsis. The plan is to wean off pressors as tolerated and continue monitoring.

3. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases or pneumonia given the left pleural effusion. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

4. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation that has not responded to cardioversion. The plan is to continue amiodarone and monitor the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms such as malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He has been diagnosed with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV). The patient has undergone multiple cardioversions without success and has been intubated for respiratory distress. He also has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphadenopathy, which raises concern for malignancy. Further investigations are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to atrial fibrillation with RVR and/or infection/sepsis. Pressors have been initiated, and the plan is to wean them as tolerated.
2. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, which could be attributed to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases, pneumonia, or other infectious etiologies. Antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are ongoing.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. The plan is to wean the ventilator as tolerated.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1 to 2.0 today. Renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He underwent cardioversion multiple times but remained in atrial fibrillation. He was intubated for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, thrombocytopenia with platelet count fluctuating, cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction, asymmetric lower extremity edema, anemia of chronic disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, arthritis, gout, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and/or infection/sepsis. Pressors have been initiated, and the plan is to wean them as tolerated.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases, pneumonia given left pleural effusion, or other infectious etiology. Further investigations, including tapping of left pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology,"

   As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and
   the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. A newly introduced
   Swan-Ganz
   catheter is also in correct position, its tip projects over the
   proximal parts
   of the right pulmonary artery. Positional decrease in transparency of
   the left hemithorax. A small right basal atelectasis has newly
   occurred. There
   is no evidence of pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
   unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u  peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - f/u LN biopsy results
   - f/u L pleural effusion results
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   - f/u oncology recs
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis, but
   improved since yesterday. On pressors.  CVP 7 this AM.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue Amiodarone for rate control, though patient unlikely to
   convert to sinus given persistent a fib with failure to cardiovert and
   maintain in sinus
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   - Float swan today, will consider diuresis based on pressure readings.
   - Bolus to keep CVP at >8
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus PNA given L pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
   - f/u tap of L pleural effusion - flow cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   Digoxin d/c
ed due to renal failure.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - No coumadin as want to have flexibility regarding procedures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr jumped from approximately 1 to 2.0 today.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   - try to decrease sedation and examine patient today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 8 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets increased yesterday but back down
   today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt with goal CVP >8
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema b/l
   today. Most likely [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Change simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in -patient
   - uptitrate insulin today
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 resolved with free water flushes with tube
   feeds.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He underwent cardioversion seven times, with recent spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm on amiodarone, but then reverted back to atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated for respiratory distress.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Elevated LDH: Initially concerning for ischemia in the context of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, however, given the degree of elevation and finding of right axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for malignancy. CT torso consistent with melanoma vs. lymphoma.
2. Hypotension: Likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and/or infection/sepsis, but improved since yesterday. On pressors. Central venous pressure (CVP) 7 this morning.
3. Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases, versus pneumonia given left pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
4. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response: Believe this has been chronic, given dilated left ventricle and decreased ejection fraction on echo"

   As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the
   nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. A newly introduced
   Swan-Ganz catheter is also in correct position, its tip projects over
   the proximal parts of the right pulmonary artery. Positional decrease
   in transparency of the left hemithorax. A small right basal atelectasis
   has newly occurred. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The size of

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u with Heme/Onc for biopsy results, L pleural effusion results,
   peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - Core biopsy today, as ?insufficient sample from FNA; call IR to
   confirm
   - [**Hospital1 7**] tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   Digoxin d/c
ed due to renal failure.  Rates went up to high 150
   overnight with SBP in 70
s, started on second pressor (Neosynephrine)
   in anticipation of starting Esmolol drip for rate control.  However,
   the decision was made to attempt cardioversion, and patient underwent
   8^th in-house cardioversion and was in sinus tachycardia for <10
   minutes before going back into afib at rates in 130
s-140
   Refractory a fib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial
   irritation vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc
   management plan.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed at (N) 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and (L) 1.5
   mcg/kg/hr
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis, but
   improved since yesterday. Now on 2 pressors, Levophed and
   Norsynephrine.
   - Maintain Levophed and wean off Norsynephrine as tolerated,
   particularly given low EF
   - Continue Amiodarone po for rate control, though patient unlikely to
   convert to sinus given persistent a fib with failure to cardiovert and
   maintain in sinus
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   - Bolus to keep CVP at >8
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus PNA given L pleural effusion versus other infectious etiology.
   Fever up to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough
   this morning.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results, ?core biopsy today
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime; ID approval for Vanc needed today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Currently volume overloaded, on Lasix
   drip.
   - Float swan today, will consider diuresis based on pressure readings.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt with goal CVP >8
   - monitor I
s & O
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease, but now with down-trending hct, 24
   today.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in -patient
   - uptitrate insulin today
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8 today, continuing to trend up from
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   - follow mental status, but limited given sedation
   - try to decrease sedation and examine patient today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 8 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets increased yesterday but back down
   today.
   - Trend plts
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   - Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV). The patient underwent cardioversion multiple times but did not respond well. He spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm briefly but returned to atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, fevers, respiratory failure, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, asymmetric lower extremity edema, hyperlipidemia, gout, and arthritis.

The patient is currently intubated and on ventilator support. He is receiving multiple medications including Heparin, Amiodarone, Levophed, and Neosynephrine. The patient's lab results show elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), leukopenia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia of chronic disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperlipidemia.

Imaging studies reveal a small right basal atelectasis and no evidence of pneumothorax. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and showed correct positioning in the proximal parts of the right pulmonary artery.

The patient's medical team is considering various potential medical complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities including potential malignancy, cardiomyopathy, anemia, hypotension, fever, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's markedly decreased ejection fraction and hypotension indicate potential cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of cardiac index, blood pressure, and response to pressor therapy is essential.

3. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Cultures and further workup are pending to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Malignancy: There is suspicion of malignancy given the patient's B-symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and radiographic findings suggestive of melanoma or lymphoma. Oncology consultation and further diagnostic tests, such as biopsy, are"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u with Heme/Onc for biopsy results, L pleural effusion results,
   peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - Core biopsy today, as ?insufficient sample from FNA; call IR to
   confirm
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   Digoxin d/c
ed due to renal failure.  Rates went up to high 150
   overnight with SBP in 70
s, started on second pressor (Neosynephrine)
   in anticipation of starting Esmolol drip for rate control.  However,
   the decision was made to attempt cardioversion, and patient underwent
   8^th in-house cardioversion and was in sinus tachycardia for <10
   minutes before going back into afib at rates in 130
s-140
   Refractory a fib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial
   irritation vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc
   management plan.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed at (N) 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and (L) 1.5
   mcg/kg/hr
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, consider very slow
   Esmolol drip as tolerated
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   but improved since yesterday. Now on 2 pressors, Levophed and
   Norsynephrine.  Cardiac index >2.5 with SVR in 700
s on 2 pressors,
   lower than expected.  Appears to have a distributive shock in addition
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - Monitor cardiac index serially
   - Maintain Levophed and attempt to wean off Norsynephrine if tolerated,
   particularly given low EF
   - Continue Amiodarone po for rate control, though patient unlikely to
   convert to sinus given persistent a fib with failure to cardiovert and
   maintain in sinus
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus culture negative sepsis; currently broadly covering with
   Vanc/Cefepime but without full anaerobic coverage.  Fever up to [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough this morning.
   - Consult ID re: possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results, ?core biopsy today
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Start [**11-4**]); ID approval for Vanc needed
   today
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially.
   Swan placed yesterday, shows adequate CI on 2 pressors (2.7-3.3) but
   increasing renal failure, likely [**2-19**] poor forward flow.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease, but now with down-trending hct, 24
   today.  Goal to keep >25.
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBC
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.  Currently on
   CPAP/Pressure Support Ventilation with increased recruitment of alveoli
   on PEEP 10, PS 15 based on CXR.
   - Decrease Pressure Support today
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8 today, continuing to trend up from
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status worse today, pt not responsive to pain or verbal stimuli.
   - Decrease sedation and f/u mental status
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 8 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets increased yesterday but back down
   today.
   - Trend plts post-transfusion
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Arrange family meeting to discuss pt status and

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient underwent multiple cardioversions, but remained in atrial fibrillation with difficult-to-control rates. He is now intubated for respiratory distress and on multiple pressors. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low cardiac index and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock due to his decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has been febrile and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible infectious etiology. There is a need for further evaluation of blood and urine cultures and tapping of left pleural effusion.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for respiratory distress and is on CPAP/Pressure Support Ventilation. There is a concern for worsening respiratory failure, and efforts are being made to decrease pressure support.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to hypoperfusion secondary to hypotension or cardi"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u with derm for biopsy results, L pleural effusion results,
   peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   - will attempt to obtain plasma metanephrines from labs prior to
   initiation of pressors.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   more recently, esmolol gtt and pressors.  Cardoversion x8 has been
   unsuccessful, however given that he is now fully loaded on amio and in
   [**Last Name (LF) 10946**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] re-attempt cardioversion today and then consider EP eval
   today for ablation of flutter or partial AV nodal ablation.  Refractory
   afib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation
   vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management
   plan, also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed as needed
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, titrate esmolol and
   pressures for optimal hemodynamics.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   now on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and
   improved with titration of esmolol and pressors.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   -titrate esmolol/pressures to hemodynamics
   -diuresis if tolerated based on CVP
   - Continue Amiodarone po for rate control
   - Antibiotics for infection
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus culture negative sepsis; currently broadly covering with
   Vanc/Cefepime but without full anaerobic coverage.  Fever up to [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough this morning.
   Concern for drug tox, viral etiology as well.  Appreciate ID recs.
   -bronchial washings/DFA/viral cxs pending
   -f/u ENT regarding sinus infection, concern for fungal etiology
   -continue tamiflu/contact [**Name (NI) 10945**] for now
   -switch famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever
   -will DC abx in 24 hrs if no growth
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Anemia: Pt did not respond as expected to 2 units PRBCs, however no
   evidence of active bleed
   - Transfuse additional 2 units PRBC, lasix
   - post-transfusion crit
   - DIC labs today
   - blood smear today
   -guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well however requried CMV last night
   for hypoxia.
   -titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   -cultures pending
   -continue abx for now
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8 today, continuing to trend up from
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requrements.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Worsening.
   - Continue to trend platelets
   - HIT ab today
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction. The patient underwent cardioversion multiple times, but without success. He is now intubated for respiratory distress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignancy: The patient's elevated LDH levels and axillary lymphadenopathy raise concern for malignancy. A CT torso is consistent with melanoma or lymphoma, and cytology/cytometry/biopsy results are pending.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, which has not responded to multiple cardioversions. Digoxin, amiodarone, and esmolol have been attempted to control the heart rate, but the patient remains in atrial fibrillation. Further attempts at cardioversion will be made, and an electrophysiology evaluation for ablation or partial AV nodal ablation is planned.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is on two pressors (Levophed and Norsynephrine) and has a cardiac index within normal limits. Cardiac output is being monitored serially, and esmolol/pressures are being titrated for optimal hemodynamics. Diuresis will be continued based on central venous pressure (CVP).
4. Fevers: The patient's fever is likely due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases or culture-negative sepsis. Broad coverage with Vanc/Cefepime has been initiated, but without full anaerobic coverage. Bronchial washings/DFA/viral cxs are pending, and tamiflu has been initiated due to concern for influenza.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's new EF of 20% with a globally dilated RV is most likely tachycardia-induced. Monitoring of I/O, cardiac index, and titration of diuresis based on CVP are ongoing.
6. Anemia: The patient did not respond adequately to 2 units PRBCs, indicating a possible ongoing bleed or hemolysis. Additional PRBCs will be transfused, and DIC labs will be checked.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for increased work of breathing and CMV for hypoxia. Vent settings are being titrated to ABGs, and weaning to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated is planned.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's last A1c was 7.4%, and his sugars have been poorly controlled in the hospital. An insulin drip has been initiated.
9. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u with Heme/Onc for biopsy results, L pleural effusion results,
   peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - Core biopsy today, as ?insufficient sample from FNA; call IR to
   confirm
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   diuresis.  Cardioversion x5 without success for more than 1 hour.
   Spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm yesterday on Amiodarone, back
   in A fib this morning after Amio drip was d/c
ed.  Re-initiated Amio
   drip with conversion to sinus subsequently, but since [**11-3**] back in a
   fib with RVR at rates 120
s. 2 more failed cardioversions on [**11-4**]/9.
   Digoxin d/c
ed due to renal failure.  Rates went up to high 150
   overnight with SBP in 70
s, started on second pressor (Neosynephrine)
   in anticipation of starting Esmolol drip for rate control.  However,
   the decision was made to attempt cardioversion, and patient underwent
   8^th in-house cardioversion and was in sinus tachycardia for <10
   minutes before going back into afib at rates in 130
s-140
   Refractory a fib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial
   irritation vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc
   management plan.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed at (N) 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and (L) 1.5
   mcg/kg/hr
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, consider very slow
   Esmolol drip as tolerated
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   but improved since yesterday. Now on 2 pressors, Levophed and
   Norsynephrine.  Cardiac index >2.5 with SVR in 700
s on 2 pressors,
   lower than expected.  Appears to have a distributive shock in addition
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - Monitor cardiac index serially
   - Maintain Levophed and attempt to wean off Norsynephrine if tolerated,
   particularly given low EF
   - Continue Amiodarone po for rate control, though patient unlikely to
   convert to sinus given persistent a fib with failure to cardiovert and
   maintain in sinus
   - Antibiotics for infection, as below (7 this AM)
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus culture negative sepsis; currently broadly covering with
   Vanc/Cefepime but without full anaerobic coverage.  Fever up to [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough this morning.
   - Consult ID re: possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   - f/u oncology recs & FNA biopsy results, ?core biopsy today
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Start [**11-4**]); ID approval for Vanc needed
   today
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially.
   Swan placed yesterday, shows adequate CI on 2 pressors (2.7-3.3) but
   increasing renal failure, likely [**2-19**] poor forward flow.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease, but now with down-trending hct, 24
   today.  Goal to keep >25.
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBC
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well. Had white-out of left lung
   yesterday afternoon, but cleared shortly thereafter; believed to be due
   to mucus plugging that was ameliorated by suctioning.  Currently on
   CPAP/Pressure Support Ventilation with increased recruitment of alveoli
   on PEEP 10, PS 15 based on CXR.
   - Decrease Pressure Support today
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8 today, continuing to trend up from
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - consider decreasing allopurinol dose if Cr continues to rise
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status worse today, pt not responsive to pain or verbal stimuli.
   - Decrease sedation and f/u mental status
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Trend closely and consider HIT type I vs II;
   currently day 8 of Heparin, as initiated [**10-30**], but no clear history of
   prior Heparin exposure. Platelets increased yesterday but back down
   today.
   - Trend plts post-transfusion
   - Consider HIT antibodies if platelets continue to down-trend
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Arrange family meeting to discuss pt status and
   management plans.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient underwent multiple cardioversions without success and has been intubated for respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including elevated LDH suggestive of malignancy, hypotension/shock likely due to cardiogenic and distributive shock, fever possibly due to infection or malignancy-related B-symptoms, cardiomyopathy with a significantly reduced ejection fraction, anemia, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, diabetes mellitus type II, acute renal failure, neurologic changes possibly due to metastatic malignancy or thromboembolic event, thrombocytopenia, asymmetric left lower extremity edema, hyperlipidemia, arthritis, and gout. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU with various interventions including antibiotics, diuretics, pressor support, insulin infusion, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignancy: The elevated LDH levels and presence of axillary lymphadenopathy raise concerns for malignancy. Further evaluation is needed, including biopsy results, to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. The patient was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV). He has undergone multiple cardioversions without success, but is currently in sinus rhythm following cardioversion, AV node modification, and pacemaker placement.

The patient is intubated for respiratory distress and has been on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable with controlled heart rate. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for fever, which is suspected to be due to malignancy or sepsis. Laboratory results show anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Renal function is impaired, but improving.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is on insulin drip. Neurologic changes include confusion and left-sided extremity weakness, possibly related to metastasis of malignancy or thromboembolic event. Physical examination reveals asymmetric lower extremity edema, likely due to heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and titration of vent settings are necessary"

The patient has undergone multiple cardioversions, but the atrial fibrillation persists. He is currently intubated for respiratory distress.

The patient has been diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, which is a rare type of skin cancer. Elevated LDH levels and the presence of axillary lymphadenopathy are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's CT torso also showed findings consistent with malignancy, and a biopsy confirmed Merkel cell carcinoma. Further tests, including cytology, cytometry, and biopsy results, are pending.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure. His anemia did not respond as expected to 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but there is no evidence of active bleeding. The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to hypoperfusion, and his blood sugar levels are poorly controlled while in the hospital.

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Elevated LDH/Likely malignancy: Initially concerning for ischemia in
   the context of afib with RVR, however given this degree of elevation
   and finding of R axillary lymphadenopathy, now concerned for
   malignancy.  CT torso consistent w/ melanoma vs. lymphoma.
   Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u with derm for biopsy results, L pleural effusion results,
   peripheral blood sent for flow cytometry
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
 K, phos, uric acid, Cr
   - will attempt to obtain plasma metanephrines from labs prior to
   initiation of pressors.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   more recently, esmolol gtt and pressors.  Cardoversion x8 has been
   unsuccessful, however given that he is now fully loaded on amio and in
   [**Last Name (LF) 10946**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] re-attempt cardioversion today and then consider EP eval
   today for ablation of flutter or partial AV nodal ablation.  Refractory
   afib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation
   vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management
   plan, also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed as needed
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, titrate esmolol and
   pressures for optimal hemodynamics.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   now on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and
   improved with titration of esmolol and pressors.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   -titrate esmolol/pressures to hemodynamics
   -diuresis if tolerated based on CVP
   - Continue Amiodarone po for rate control
   - Antibiotics for infection
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus culture negative sepsis; currently broadly covering with
   Vanc/Cefepime but without full anaerobic coverage.  Fever up to [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough this morning.
   Concern for drug tox, viral etiology as well.  Appreciate ID recs.
   -bronchial washings/DFA/viral cxs pending
   -f/u ENT regarding sinus infection, concern for fungal etiology
   -continue tamiflu/contact [**Name (NI) 10945**] for now
   -switch famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever
   -will DC abx in 24 hrs if no growth
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   .
   # Anemia: Pt did not respond as expected to 2 units PRBCs, however no
   evidence of active bleed
   - Transfuse additional 2 units PRBC, lasix
   - post-transfusion crit
   - DIC labs today
   - blood smear today
   -guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well however requried CMV last night
   for hypoxia.
   -titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   -cultures pending
   -continue abx for now
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8 today, continuing to trend up from
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requrements.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Worsening.
   - Continue to trend platelets
   - HIT ab today
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions, which have been unsuccessful. He is now intubated for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated LDH: The patient's elevated LDH levels raise concern for malignancy, potentially metastatic cancer to the myocardium or novel cardiomyopathy secondary to malignancy.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter with RVR: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR is refractory to cardioversion attempts and may be related to pericardial irritation or inflammatory drive from malignancy.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is on two pressors (Levophed and Norepinephrine) for hemodynamic stability. His cardiac index is within normal limits, but he remains hypotensive.
4. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases or culture-negative sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-inch tall, 130 kg male admitted to the ICU with an influenza A infection. The patient's fever has increased to 101.7°F, and they have been started on Tamiflu and Rimantadine. They also have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and have been initiated on amiodarone drip. Lasix drip has been started to manage fluid balance, and the goal is to remove 1L of fluid. The patient's Vanc trough level is low, so the dosing has been increased due to improving renal function. DIC labs are within normal limits, and HIT antibodies have been sent for testing. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, fentanyl, norepinephrine, furosemide, and insulin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned symptoms.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/56 mmHg to 117/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight has decreased from 141 kg to 130 kg since admission.

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x7, recent
   spontaneous conversion to sinus on Amio gtt, back in a fib with RVR.
   Now intubated for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Merckel Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Cytology/cytometry/biopsy results pending.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - will attempt to obtain plasma metanephrines from labs prior to
   initiation of pressors.
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   versus culture negative sepsis; currently broadly covering with
   Vanc/Cefepime but without full anaerobic coverage.  Fever up to [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday, written for Tylenol without breakthrough this morning.
   Concern for drug tox, viral etiology as well.  Appreciate ID recs.
   Nasopharyngeal swab significant for Influenza A.  ENT consulted,
   reports sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection.
   -Initiate Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   -f/u bronchial washings/DFA/viral cxs pending
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and tap of L pleural effusion - flow
   cytometry and cytology
   -switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever
   -will DC abx in 24 hrs if no growth
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   more recently, esmolol gtt and pressors.  Cardoversion x8 has been
   unsuccessful, however given that he is now fully loaded on amio and in
   [**Last Name (LF) 10946**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] re-attempt cardioversion today and then consider EP eval
   today for ablation of flutter or partial AV nodal ablation.  Refractory
   afib with difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation
   vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management
   plan, also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Currently in
   sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification and pacer
   placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   esmolol and pressors, currently off Esmolol as pt is back in sinus with
   HR in 90
s-100
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   -Goal negative 1L
 initiate Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone po
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Pt did not respond as expected to 2 units
   PRBCs, however no evidence of active bleed.  Transfused additional 2
   units PRBC, lasix given.
   - PM Hct
   - follow DIC labs
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   -guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well however requried CMV last night
   for hypoxia.
   -titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   -cultures pending
   -continue abx for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.0 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requrements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: LE edema L>R and cooler LLE compared to RLE, but
   coolness resolved today with b/l warm LEs.  No need for arterial
   studies given improvement of sxs, possible resolution of emboli in
   setting of supratherapeutic PTT.  LE doppler negative.  Edema
   asymmetric but temperature of extremities equal b/l today. Most likely
   [**2-19**] heart failure.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF), and dilated left ventricle (LV). The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate a potential complication related to his respiratory system.
2. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR may lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new-found EF of 20% with globally dilated right ventricle (RV). This may be tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: The patient did not respond as expected to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion, indicating a possible complication related to blood disorders.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
6. Diabetes mellitus type II (DMII): The patient's poorly controlled sugars while inpatient necessitated the initiation of an insulin drip.

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-addreswcode status, ?CMO/hospice with family
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   however now with positive influenza screen which could also be
   contributing. ENT consulted, reports sinus opacity on head CT bleed
   rather than infection. Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for
   drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - dc current abx regimen, will start ceftriaxone for gram negative rods
   and gram + cocci in sputum
   -f/u influenza A testing with state lab, ? H1N1
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Currently in sinus
   following cardioversion, AV node modification and pacer placement, and
   continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   esmolol and pressors, currently off Esmolol as pt is back in sinus with
   HR in 90
s-100
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   -Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone po
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   -continue statin
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   -guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well however requried CMV last night
   for hypoxia.
   -titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   -continue abx for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.0 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes who presents with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions, and now presents with a new Merkel cell carcinoma diagnosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases, however now with positive influenza screen which could also be contributing.

2. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response: The patient has not responded to multiple attempts at cardioversion. However, the heart rate has improved with digoxin, amiodarone, and occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors. There is concern for pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive from malignancy or metastatic cancer to myocardium.

3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and/or infection/sepsis. He is currently on norepinephrine and has been briefly on Levophed and Norsynephrine.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new-found ejection fraction of 20% with globally dilated right ventricle, most likely"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

1. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever ranging from 101.7 to 100 degrees Celsius. This indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. The ventilator settings show a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a slightly low pH of 7.34, high carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 62 mmHg, and normal oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL. The exact cause of anemia is not mentioned in the note.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no specific information provided about the impaired skin integrity, but it may be related to the patient's critical condition and prolonged immobilization.

   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-addreswcode status, ?CMO/hospice with family
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   however now with positive influenza screen which could also be
   contributing. ENT consulted, reports sinus opacity on head CT bleed
   rather than infection. Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for
   drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - dc current abx regimen, will start ceftriaxone for gram negative rods
   and gram + cocci in sputum
   -f/u influenza A testing with state lab, ? H1N1
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  However HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Currently in sinus
   following cardioversion, AV node modification and pacer placement, and
   continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   esmolol and pressors, currently off Esmolol as pt is back in sinus with
   HR in 90
s-100
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   -Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone po
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   -continue statin
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   -guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Tolerating ventilator well however requried CMV last night
   for hypoxia.
   -titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   -continue abx for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.0 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt.  Will
   try this if UOP slowing off.
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   - if febrile, consider broadening Abx coverage again
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has a markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle (LV) and is now diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient requires multiple interventions including cardioversion, partial atrioventricular (AV) ablation, antibiotics, and insulin therapy. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, neurologic changes, asymmetric lower extremity edema, hyperlipidemia, gout, and arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR): The patient's AF with RVR may lead to complications such as heart failure, thromboembolism, and arrhythmias.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's decreased EF and dilated LV suggest cardiomyopathy, which can contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Merkel cell carcinoma: The patient's recent diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma indicates a poor prognosis and potential metastasis, which may affect various organ systems.
4. Respiratory failure: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status, ?CMO/hospice with family
   .
   # Fevers: Most likely B-symptoms from lymphoma/malignancy/metastases,
   however now with positive influenza screen which could also be
   contributing. ENT consulted, reports sinus opacity on head CT bleed
   rather than infection. Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for
   drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - d/c current abx regimen, on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and
   gram + cocci in sputum
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Believe this has been chronic,
   given dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation
   from novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   esmolol and pressors, currently off Esmolol as pt is back in sinus with
   HR in 90
s-120
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I

   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   -continue statin

   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.0 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt.  Will
   try this if UOP slowing off.
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   - if febrile, consider broadening Abx coverage again
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms including malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions, but remains in atrial fibrillation. He is currently on amiodarone, digoxin, and norepinephrine. The patient also has a recent diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma and is experiencing fevers, respiratory failure requiring intubation, hypotension, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has persistent atrial fibrillation despite multiple cardioversions. This can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia or consolidation at the bases of the lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient is currently on norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating possible septic shock or hypoperfusion.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure, which can be caused by hypoperfusion or sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt.  Will
   try this if UOP slowing off.
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   - if febrile, consider broadening Abx coverage again
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and other medical conditions. The patient's recent events include restarting amiodarone drip, converting to normal sinus rhythm, receiving extra Lasix to promote diuresis, and having negative HIT panel results. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, amiodarone, heparin sodium, insulin, and norepinephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 600 mL. There is concern for potential complications related to the ventilator, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
3. Fever: The patient has a recorded temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), indicating a fever. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be attributed to several factors, including sepsis, medication side effects, or the patient's underlying medical conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt.  Will
   try this if UOP slowing off.
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   - if febrile, consider broadening Abx coverage again
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt.  Will
   try this if UOP slowing off.
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   - if febrile, consider broadening Abx coverage again
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt., will
   given PRN IV bolus to keep UOP
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - f/u CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously
   with white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone cardioversion eight times and now has a new diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has not responded to multiple cardioversions. His heart rate has improved with digoxin, amiodarone, and occasional use of esmolol. He is currently in atrial fibrillation despite previous sinus rhythm following cardioversion, AV node modification, and pacer placement. Amiodarone is being continued, and repeat cardioversion is being considered if the patient remains in atrial fibrillation for 24-48 hours after amiodarone loading.

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new EF of 20% with globally dilated right ventricle. This is most likely tachycardia-induced. He is being monitored for I/O and cardiac index, and diuresis is being titrated to central pressures. ACE/BB is planned once BP stabilizes and ARF improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial fibrillation
   despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node modification
   and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - Continue Heparin gtt (CHADS score 2; hypertension and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   -Lasix drip for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O later
   - seems to respond better to 80 mg IV bolus as opposed to gtt., will
   given PRN IV bolus to keep UOP
   -continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, Levophed and Norsynephrine, currently only on
   Norepinephrine.  Cardiac index WNL and improved with titration of
   pressors. SVR still low at 400.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L
 continue Lasix drip if necessary
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - continue abx for now
   - f/u CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously
   with white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved.
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen. ENT consulted, reports
   sinus opacity on head CT bleed rather than infection. Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat bcx, ucx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - on ceftriaxone for gram negative rods and gram + cocci in sputum
   - CXR from [**2148-11-10**] showing ?consolidation at bases; previously with
   white out of left lung, ?mucus plug, now improved
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with Merckel Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - f/u HIT antibodies, still pending
   - guiac stools
   - f/u DIC labs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 1.8 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - Lasix drip if needed for goal -1L as above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and is found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions without success, and his heart rate has improved with digoxin, amiodarone, and occasional use of esmolol. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. He is also on pressors for hypotension and has been diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient has renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, neurologic changes, asymmetric lower extremity edema, hyperlipidemia, arthritis, and gout. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severely decreased ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle.
2. Respiratory failure due to worsening lung condition.
3. Sepsis or infection due to elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever.
4. Thromboembolic event due to atrial fibrillation and immobilization.
5. Metastatic spread of Merkel cell carcinoma to the brain or other organs.
6. Acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion and pre-existing conditions.
7. Complications related to diabetes mell"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with approximately one week of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle. He has undergone eight cardioversions, but remains in atrial fibrillation despite the use of amiodarone, digoxin, and occasional esmolol. The patient also has a recent diagnosis of [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rate has improved with digoxin and amiodarone, but he remains in atrial fibrillation. There is concern for pericardial irritation or inflammatory drive from malignancy.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a decreased EF of 20% with globally dilated right ventricle. This is likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is on noradrenaline for blood pressure support and has shown improvement with titration of pressors. His cardiac index is within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with [**Numeric Identifier 1427**] and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with [**Location (un) 1427**]: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR first improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial
   fibrillation despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt; discuss with EP how much is to be loaded
   before stopping
   - consider repeat cardioversion if patient is in atrial flutter
   - digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head w&w/o contrast to better assess etiology of lesions
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   - Lasix drip +/- bolus + metolazone for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with [**Month/Day (2) 1427**] and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, currently only on norepinephrine.  Cardiac index
   WNL and improved with titration of pressors. SVR still low at 459.
   Worrisome for mixed cardiogenic / distributive shock picture.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1.5L.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - continue norepinephrine
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen.  Switched famotidine
   to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat BCx, UCx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - on CTZ, vanc, cipro per ID recs
   - CXR from [**2148-11-12**] showing worsened R lung infiltrates, improved L
   lung aeration

   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presented with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with a markedly decreased ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions, but remains in atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been experiencing fevers, and his influenza screen was positive. He has hypotension and requires norepinephrine. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is receiving insulin for poorly controlled diabetes. He has asymmetric pupils and has had two new lesions on CT head, which are worrisome for metastasis or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. An MRI head has been ordered to better assess the etiology of the lesions. The patient's cardiac index is within normal limits, and he has diuretic resistance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial bleeds: The patient has asymmetric pupils and has shown two new lesions on CT head that are worrisome for metastasis or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Further imaging with an MRI head is recommended to better assess the etiology of the lesions.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly decreased e"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with [**Numeric Identifier 1427**] and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with [**Location (un) 1427**]: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR first improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial
   fibrillation despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - continue Norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
s, pt is no longer on
   esmolol
   .
   # intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head w&w/o contrast to better assess etiology of lesions
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   - Lasix drip +/- bolus + diuril for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with [**Month/Day (2) 1427**] and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, currently only on norepinephrine.  Cardiac index
   WNL and improved with titration of pressors. SVR still low at 459.
   Worrisome for mixed cardiogenic / distributive shock picture.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially
   - Goal negative 1L.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   .
   # Fevers: likely from positive influenza screen.  Switched famotidine
   to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat BCx, UCx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - on CTZ, vanc, cipro per ID recs
   - CXR from [**2148-11-12**] showing worsened R lung infiltrates, improved L
   lung aeration
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.0 today,
   baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension.  UOP
   adequate.  No indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with an ejection fraction of 20% and dilated left ventricle. He has undergone multiple cardioversions, but remains in atrial fibrillation. The patient has a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma and is experiencing fevers, asymmetric pupils, asymmetric limb edema, confusion, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's persistent atrial fibrillation is refractory to cardioversion and amiodarone therapy. This may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or thromboembolism.
2. Intracranial Bleeds: The patient's CT head shows new lesions worrisome for metastasis versus intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Further evaluation with an MRI is recommended to better assess the etiology of these lesions. If hemorrhagic, it could result in increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's significantly decreased ejection fraction and globally dilated right ventricle suggest tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. This condition can lead to heart failure and reduced cardiac output.
4. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension and low systemic vascular"

   - CT head final read: 1. New very small hyperdense focus in the right
   frontal area, New or more conspicuous hypodensity in the right
   cerebellar area (subdural hemorrhage versus new metastasis). Persistent
   extra-axial nodule anteriorly overlying the anterior right frontal
   lobe.  followup CT to assess for stability or progression.
   2. Progressed opacification of mastoid air cells and right maxillary
   sinus without bony destruction that may relate to intubation.
   NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is now a definite blood/fluid
   level, layering within a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in
   the region of the right frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving
   hemorrhage. Its relation to the more anteriorly-located well-defined
   hyperdense focus is unclear. The additional focus, along the right
   lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient
   cistern, was not clearly present and also may represent evolving
   hemorrhage.

   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR first improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial
   fibrillation despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt; as per EP
   - consider repeat cardioversion if patient is in atrial flutter
   - digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt. (attending addendum
   to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid level, layering within
   a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in the region of the right
   frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving hemorrhage. Its relation
   to the more anteriorly-located well-defined hyperdense focus is
   unclear. The additional focus, along the right lateral aspect of the
   tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient cistern, was not clearly
   present and also may represent evolving hemorrhage.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head w&w/o contrast to better assess etiology of lesions
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   - Lasix drip +/- bolus + metolazone for goal -1L today; will f/u I/O
   - continue statin
   - replace swan today
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   briefly on 2 pressors, currently only on norepinephrine.  Cardiac index
   WNL and improved with titration of pressors. SVR still low at 459.
   Worrisome for mixed cardiogenic / distributive shock picture.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially once swan replaced
   - Goal negative (1-1.5L.)
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - Norepinephrine
   - continue Vasopressin as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**11-4**]/9 for increased work of
   breathing. Required increase in ventilatory support o/n, but CXR this
   AM improved.
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   - await H1N1 results from government lab
   .
   # Fevers: (104.5 overnight) likely from positive influenza screen vs
   Merkell.  Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir (d4-5), Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat BCx, UCx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - on CTZ, vanc, cipro per ID recs
   - CXR from [**2148-11-12**] showing worsened R lung infiltrates, improved L
   lung aeration
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma.  Poor prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc, expert recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma.
   - f/u MRI for results for ? brain mets
   - re-address code status
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.4 today up
   from 2.0, baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension
   ?contribution of diuresis.  UOP adequate.  No indications for dialysis
   at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable.
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
- 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
- Presenting with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- Markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle.
- Cardioversion attempted multiple times, but not successful.
- New diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma.
- Multiple medical complications including intracranial bleeds, cardiomyopathy, hypotension/shock, respiratory failure, fevers, anemia/thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and neurologic changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial bleeds: The presence of multiple enhancing lesions on MRI and hypodensity in the right cerebellar area suggests possible intracranial bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the bleed.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with global dilation of the right ventricle. This may be due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or metastatic cancer to the myocardium. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is currently on norepinephrine and has low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This indicates potential hypotension or distributive shock. Care"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, and cardiomyopathy. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 40.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 to 149/65 mmHg, heart rate between 67 and 158 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure of 55/29 mmHg, and a fluid balance of -1291 mL over the past 24 hours. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and blood glucose levels. The blood cultures from 11/12/2148 at 05:06 AM and 03:19 PM were positive for gram-negative rods. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase and AST levels. The coagulation profile reveals prolonged PT and PTT times. The cardiac markers (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are within normal limits. The electrolyte levels are slightly imbalanced, with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint and presenting symptoms are not clearly stated in the note. However, it appears that the patient is in the ICU for severe illness or injury.

The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), anemia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, fever, epistaxis, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and cardiomyopathy.

The note mentions several imaging findings, including multiple enhancing lesions on MRI and a new small hyperdense focus in the right frontal area, along with a hypodensity in the right cerebellar area, suggesting a possible subdural hemorrhage or new metastasis. There is also mention of opacification of mastoid air cells and right maxillary sinus without bony destruction, which may be related to intubation.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a maximum temperature of 104.5 degrees Celsius, blood pressure fluctuating between 125/57 mmHg and 149/65 mmHg, heart rate varying between 67-158 bpm, respiratory rate between 17-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 141 kg at admission to 139 kg currently.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressin, and other ICU medications."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2148-11-14**]
   -MRI showed multpile enhancing lesions
   [**2148-11-13**]
   - CT head final read: 1. New very small hyperdense focus in the right
   frontal area, New or more conspicuous hypodensity in the right
   cerebellar area (subdural hemorrhage versus new metastasis). Persistent
   extra-axial nodule anteriorly overlying the anterior right frontal
   lobe.  followup CT to assess for stability or progression.
   2. Progressed opacification of mastoid air cells and right maxillary
   sinus without bony destruction that may relate to intubation.
   NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is now a definite blood/fluid
   level, layering within a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in
   the region of the right frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving
   hemorrhage. Its relation to the more anteriorly-located well-defined
   hyperdense focus is unclear. The additional focus, along the right
   lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient
   cistern, was not clearly present and also may represent evolving
   hemorrhage.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now in and out of Afib, (currently
   sinus) despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt as per EP
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Vasopressin
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - off heparin [**2-19**] concern for intracranial bleed
   - IV Metoprolol as needed for rate control
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: Newly-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and markedly decreased ejection fraction (EF) with dilated left ventricle. He underwent cardioversion multiple times but remains in and out of atrial fibrillation despite medication.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. He has a history of [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and has been diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, neurologic changes, asymmetric lower extremity edema, hyperlipidemia, arthritis, and gout.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 149/65 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 67 to 158 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on multiple medications including amiodarone, vasopressin, norepinephrine, furosemide, metoprolol, and insulin.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR has improved with digoxin, amiodarone and occasional
   use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with difficult to
   control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs. inflammatory drive
   from malignancy; see below for onc management plan, also concern for
   metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now in and out of Afib, (currently
   sinus) despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone as per EP
   - consider repeat cardioversion if remains in atrial fibrillation with
   24-48 hours of amiodarone / once amiodarone load felt to be adequate
   - Continue Vasopressin
   - Digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - off heparin [**2-19**] concern for intracranial bleed
   - IV Metoprolol as needed for rate control

He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and is suspected to have sepsis or infection. He requires vasopressors for hemodynamic instability. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical complications including cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, and possible malignancy with metastasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle suggest a cardiomyopathy, which may be related to his recent diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia or consolidation in the lungs.

   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR first improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial
   fibrillation despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt @1mg/min; as per EP
   - consider repeat cardioversion if patient is in atrial flutter, DNR if
   for instability
   - digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt. (attending addendum
   to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid level, layering within
   a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in the region of the right
   frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving hemorrhage. Its relation
   to the more anteriorly-located well-defined hyperdense focus is
   unclear. The additional focus, along the right lateral aspect of the
   tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient cistern, was not clearly
   present and also may represent evolving hemorrhage.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head c/w single punctuate hemorrhage, unclear as to
   relationship to mets which are not intraparenchymal
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s and cardiac index, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - ACE/BB once BP stabilizes and ARF improves
   - Given inability to maintain BP, will hold off on diuresis today.
   - continue statin
   - replace swan today pending family discussion of CMO
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR and/or infection/sepsis,
   currently only on norepinephrine and vasopressin.  Cardiac index
   unattained when swan was removed, last CVP was elevated as well as
   pulmonary artery pressure .  Worrisome for mixed cardiogenic /
   distributive shock picture.
   - Continue to monitor cardiac index serially once swan replaced
   - Patient self diuresing currently, will hold off on diuretics until
   ARF resolves/improves
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt
   - Norepinephrine
   - continue Vasopressin as needed
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**2148-11-4**] for increased work of
   breathing. Ventilatory support settings stable for days
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to PSV as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   - await H1N1 results from government lab
   .
   # Fevers: (104.5 overnight) likely from influenza vs Merkell.  Switched
   famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat BCx, UCx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - would hold off on further cultures for lower grade fevers as all have
   been negative
   - on CTZ, vanc, cipro per ID recs
   - CXR from [**2148-11-12**] showing worsened R lung infiltrates, improved L
   lung aeration
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma, MRI showing cranial and dural mets.  Poor
   prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc, expert recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma (await email response.)
   - DNR/DNI, family meeting re: CMO pending
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - holding off until results of family meeting
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.4 today up
   from 2.0, baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension
   ?contribution of diuresis.  UOP adequate.  No indications for dialysis
   at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   No intracerebral mets on MRI, cranial and dural involvement noted.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   HF.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable though impossible to assess given mental status
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Intracranial bleeds: The patient has multiple enhancing lesions on MRI, which are consistent with extracerebral metastases. Additionally, there are new hyperdense foci in the right frontal area and right cerebellar area, which could represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or metastasis. The attending physician's note mentions evolving hemorrhage and blood/fluid level layering within an extra-axial collection.

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with global dilation of the right ventricle. This may be due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient is also experiencing diuretic resistance and hypotension, which may indicate cardiogenic shock.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and has been on ventilatory support. There is a concern for weaning off the ventilator and transitioning to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

4. Fevers: The patient has had a high fever of 104.5, likely due to influenza or Merkel cell carcinoma. Cultures have been sent, and there is a plan to repeat them if the patient continues to have fevers.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be secondary to hypoperfusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes
   who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis and Influenza A.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture.
   Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma and/or
   infection/sepsis from influenza A, currently only on norepinephrine and
   dopamine, did not tolerate vasopressin.  Swan has been removed.
   - Continue pressor support
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt and digoxin
   - continue to treat infectious process with antibiotics as below
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Unresponsive to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both
   [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and influenza A.  The patient likely has a
   dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the
   tachycardia.  The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm continued
   on amiodarone gtt @1mg/min following large IV load.  The patient is s/p
   AVJ modification with some improvement in amount of time in sinus.
   - continue amiodoarone and digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose,
   per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # Intracranial bleeds/Neurologic status
 CT head c contrast [**11-12**]
   showed no lesion worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R
   frontal, R cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs.
   intraparenchymal hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week
   ago.  NSGY was consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt.
   (attending addendum to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid
   level, layering within a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in
   the region of the right frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving
   hemorrhage. Its relation to the more anteriorly-located well-defined
   hyperdense focus is unclear. The additional focus, along the right
   lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient
   cistern, was not clearly present and also may represent evolving
   hemorrhage.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head c/w single punctuate hemorrhage, unclear as to
   relationship to mets which are not intraparenchymal
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - Given inability to maintain BP, will hold off on diuresis today.
   - continue statin
   - replace swan today pending family discussion of CMO
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**2148-11-4**] for increased work of
   breathing. Ventilatory support settings stable for days, but appears to
   becoming more hypoxic, unclear reason.  Likely secondary to volume
   overload, pneumonia and ARDS.
   - CXR this AM
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to CPAP as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   - await H1N1 results from government lab
   .
   # Fevers: (104.7 overnight) likely from influenza vs [**Location (un) 10939**] or related
   to suprainfection of pneumonia with gram negative rods in endotracheal
   suctioning.  Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - Continue ceftaz, cipro and vanc for HAP or VAP given GNRs in sputum
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   -F/U CXR from today
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma:  Initially diagnosed by elevated LDH and R
   axillary lymphadenopathy.  Imaging confirmed multiple nodules and
   intracranial/dural mets.  Pathology consistent with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma, ie cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor.  Poor prognosis at this
   time per dermatology and oncology.
   - f/u Onc and derm recs, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**] recs
 likely no chemotherapy
   at this time
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Crn stable at 2.4 today, likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from hypotension/shock.  UOP adequate.  No
   indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
 requirements changing
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   volume overload.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable though impossible to assess given mental status
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle, and a recent diagnosis of influenza A and cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor with multiple brain metastases.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has a mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture, likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metastatic carcinoma, and/or infection/sepsis from influenza A. He is currently on norepinephrine and dopamine but did not tolerate vasopressin. Pressor support will be continued, and amiodarone and digoxin will be continued as well.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation has not responded to multiple cardioversion attempts, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from the [unidentified location] cell carcinoma and influenza A. The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm and will be continued on amiodarone at 1 mg/min following a large IV load. AVJ modification has been done with some improvement in the amount of time spent in sinus rhythm.

3. Intracranial bleeds/Neurologic status: A CT head with contrast showed two new lesions (right frontal and right"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   diabetes who presents with approximately 1 week of malaise, dry cough,
   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Believe this has been chronic, given
   dilated LV and decreased EF on echo; believed due to dilation from
   novel cardiomyopathy. He has not responded to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion.  HR first improved with digoxin, amiodarone and
   occasional use of esmolol gtt and pressors.  Refractory afib with
   difficult to control rates may be [**2-19**] pericardial irritation vs.
   inflammatory drive from malignancy; see below for onc management plan,
   also concern for metastatic cancer to myocardium.  Now back in atrial
   fibrillation despite previous sinus following cardioversion, AV node
   modification and pacer placement, and continuation of po Amiodarone.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt @1mg/min; as per EP
   - consider repeat cardioversion if patient is in atrial flutter, DNR if
   for instability
   - digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose, per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120

   # intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt. (attending addendum
   to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid level, layering within
   a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in the region of the right
   frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving hemorrhage. Its relation
   to the more anteriorly-located well-defined hyperdense focus is
   unclear. The additional focus, along the right lateral aspect of the
   tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient cistern, was not clearly
   present and also may represent evolving hemorrhage.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head c/w single punctuate hemorrhage, unclear as to
   relationship to mets which are not intraparenchymal
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms of malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction. He underwent cardioversion multiple times but remains in atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a new diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, with evidence of metastasis to the brain and lymph nodes. He is experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, fevers, acute renal failure, and anemia/thrombocytopenia. His condition is deteriorating, and he is not responding well to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe left ventricular dysfunction and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Infection/sepsis leading to hypotension and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe lung infiltrates and respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic dysfunction due to amiodarone toxicity and potential metastasis of malignancy.
5. Renal failure secondary to hypoperfusion and use of diuretics.
6. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), especially with immobilization and atrial fibrillation.
7. Metastatic spread of Merkel cell carcinoma to other organs, including"

   increasing dyspnea and found to be in new-onset A.fib with RVR and
   markedly decreased EF with dilated LV, now s/p cardioversion x8, now
   with new [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma diagnosis and Influenza A.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture.
   Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma and/or
   infection/sepsis from influenza A, currently only on norepinephrine and
   dopamine, did not tolerate vasopressin.  Swan has been removed.
   - Continue pressor support
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt and digoxin
   - continue to treat infectious process with antibiotics as below
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Unresponsive to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both
   [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and influenza A.  The patient likely has a
   dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the
   tachycardia.  The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm continued
   on amiodarone gtt @1mg/min following large IV load.  The patient is s/p
   AVJ modification with some improvement in amount of time in sinus.
   - continue amiodoarone and digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He presents with symptoms including malaise, dry cough, increasing dyspnea, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle, and a recent diagnosis of cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor with multiple metastases.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple life-support measures. His vital signs include a temperature of 104.7°F, heart rate in the 160s, blood pressure in the 40s, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal multiple dural and subgaleal metastases, a mass encasing the right internal carotid, and possible cavernous sinus metastasis. The patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly, with worsening hypoxia and respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension despite being on multiple vasopressors. This may indicate cardiogenic shock due to dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to tachycardia or septic shock due to an infectious process.
2. Atrial F"

   cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both
   [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and influenza A.  The patient likely has a
   dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the
   tachycardia.  The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm continued
   on amiodarone gtt @1mg/min following large IV load.  The patient is s/p
   AVJ modification with some improvement in amount of time in sinus.
   - continue amiodoarone and digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose,
   per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # Intracranial bleeds
 Patient was found to have asymmetric pupils on
   exam and received CT head c contrast [**11-12**].  This showed no lesion
   worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R frontal, R
   cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week ago.  NSGY was
   consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt. (attending addendum
   to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid level, layering within
   a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in the region of the right
   frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving hemorrhage. Its relation
   to the more anteriorly-located well-defined hyperdense focus is
   unclear. The additional focus, along the right lateral aspect of the
   tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient cistern, was not clearly
   present and also may represent evolving hemorrhage.
   -          heparin gtt d/ced
   -          MRI head c/w single punctuate hemorrhage, unclear as to
   relationship to mets which are not intraparenchymal
   -          Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess
   bleeding, or earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - Given inability to maintain BP, will hold off on diuresis today.
   - continue statin
   - replace swan today pending family discussion of CMO
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**2148-11-4**] for increased work of
   breathing. Ventilatory support settings stable for days, but appears to
   becoming more hypoxic, unclear reason.  Likely secondary to volume
   overload, pneumonia and ARDS.
   - CXR this AM
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to CPAP as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   - await H1N1 results from government lab
   .
   # Fevers: (104.5 overnight) likely from influenza vs [**Location (un) 10939**] or related
   to suprainfection of pneumonia.  Switched famotidine to PPI out of
   concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   - repeat BCx, UCx, culture from line, consider broadening abx if
   continue to be febrile.
   - would hold off on further cultures for lower grade fevers as all have
   been negative
   - on CTZ, vanc, cipro per ID recs
   - CXR from [**2148-11-12**] showing worsened R lung infiltrates, improved L
   lung aeration
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma: Elevated LDH and finding of R axillary
   lymphadenopathy, CT torso showed c/w malignancy, biopsy consistent with
   Merckel Cell Carcinoma, MRI showing cranial and dural mets.  Poor
   prognosis at this time.
   - f/u Onc, expert recs
   - f/u Derm recs, as there is an attending familiar with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma (await email response.)
   - DNR/DNI, family meeting re: CMO pending
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - holding off until results of family meeting
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trending down from peak 2.8, 2.4 today up
   from 2.0, baseline 1.1.  Likely [**2-19**] hypoperfusion given hypotension
   ?contribution of diuresis.  UOP adequate.  No indications for dialysis
   at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
   .
   # Neurologic changes:  Concern for metastasis of malignancy affecting
   CNS vs. thormboembolic event given a fib, particularly given recent
   L-sided extremity weakness and confusion.   CT head negative for acute
   event, but significant for mass suggestive of metastatic malignancy.
   No intracerebral mets on MRI, cranial and dural involvement noted.
   Mental status not improved today.  Unclear prognosis at this time given
   sedation requirements.
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   volume overload.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes who presented with malaise, dry cough, and increasing dyspnea. He was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and markedly decreased ejection fraction with dilated left ventricle. The patient underwent cardioversion eight times but remained unresponsive. He was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma and influenza A.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is intubated due to respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation, and his ventilatory support settings have been stable for days, but he is becoming more hypoxic. His lungs show worsened right-sided infiltrates and improved left-sided aeration on chest X-ray. He is febrile with a temperature of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, likely from influenza or related to suprainfection of pneumonia.

The patient has hypotension and shock, likely secondary to cardiogenic and distributive causes such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma, and/or infection/sepsis from influenza A. He is on norepinephrine and dopamine but did not tolerate vasopressin. The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are being managed with transfusions.

His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level trending down from a peak of 2.8 to 2."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old man with htn, dm, hl, admitted with new onset rapid atrial
   fibrillation and severe cardiomyopathy (EF 20%). Status post 10
   attempts at cardioversion, loaded with Amiodarone with recurrent
   Afib/flutter & rapid ventricular response, found to have influenza A,
   on treatment dose oseltamivir.  New diagnosis of Merckel cell cancer
   confirmed by pathology, too unstable to receive chemotherapy for
   palliative treatment.
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture.
   Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma and/or
   infection/sepsis from influenza A, currently only on norepinephrine and
   dopamine, did not tolerate vasopressin.  Swan has been removed.
   - Continue pressor support
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt and digoxin
   - continue to treat infectious process with antibiotics as below
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Unresponsive to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both
   [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and influenza A.  The patient likely has a
   dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the
   tachycardia.  The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm continued
   on amiodarone gtt @1mg/min following large IV load.  The patient is s/p
   AVJ modification with some improvement in amount of time in sinus.
   - continue amiodoarone and digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose,

   level, layering within a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in
   the region of the right frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving
   hemorrhage. Its relation to the more anteriorly-located well-defined
   hyperdense focus is unclear. The additional focus, along the right
   lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lung cancer. He was admitted with new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation and severe cardiomyopathy, confirmed by an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient has been treated for influenza A and diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma. 

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions. He is experiencing hypotension and shock, likely due to cardiogenic and distributive causes. He is unresponsive to multiple cardioversions, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from the underlying conditions. The patient has a dilated cardiomyopathy that may be secondary to or worsened by the tachycardia. He is currently on amiodarone and digoxin.

The patient also has respiratory failure, intubated on [date] for increased work of breathing. His ventilatory support settings are stable, but he appears to be becoming more hypoxic, unclear reason. There is suspicion of volume overload, pneumonia, and ARDS. 

The patient has fevers, likely from influenza or related to suprainfection of pneumonia with gram-negative rods. He is being treated with oseltamivir, ramantadine for influenza A, and antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which have been addressed with transfusion. There are concerns about acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor forward flow from hypotension/shock. 

The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, poorly controlled during this admission. 

Other conditions include asymmetric left lower extremity edema, likely secondary to volume overload, hyperlipidemia, gout, and arthritis.

A family meeting has been held, and the patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old man with htn, dm, hl, admitted with new onset rapid atrial
   fibrillation and severe cardiomyopathy (EF 20%). Status post 10
   attempts at cardioversion, loaded with Amiodarone with recurrent
   Afib/flutter & rapid ventricular response, found to have influenza A,
   on treatment dose oseltamivir.  New diagnosis of Merckel cell cancer
   confirmed by pathology, too unstable to receive chemotherapy for
   palliative treatment.
   # Hypotension/Shock:  Mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture.
   Likely [**2-19**] Afib with RVR, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma and/or
   infection/sepsis from influenza A, currently only on norepinephrine and
   dopamine, did not tolerate vasopressin.  Swan has been removed.
   - Continue pressor support
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt and digoxin
   - continue to treat infectious process with antibiotics as below
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Unresponsive to multiple attempts at
   cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both
   [**Location (un) 10939**] cell carcinoma and influenza A.  The patient likely has a
   dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the
   tachycardia.  The patient is intermittently in sinus rhythm continued
   on amiodarone gtt @1mg/min following large IV load.  The patient is s/p
   AVJ modification with some improvement in amount of time in sinus.
   - continue amiodoarone and digoxin once weekly, 25% of original dose,
   per EP
   - heparin gtt stopped [**2-19**] CT head findings (CHADS score 2; hypertension
   and DM)
   - IV Metoprolol as needed to rate control in 120
   .
   # Intracranial bleeds/Neurologic status
 CT head c contrast [**11-12**]
   showed no lesion worrisome for mass effect, but two new lesions (R
   frontal, R cerebellar) were noted worrisome for metastasis vs.
   intraparenchymal hemorrhage in comparison to prior CT head one week
   ago.  NSGY was consulted and agreed with plan to d/c heparin gtt.
   (attending addendum to CT read) There is now a definite blood/fluid
   level, layering within a 14mm (AP) likely extra-axial collection, in
   the region of the right frontal operculum (2:18), suggesting evolving
   hemorrhage. Its relation to the more anteriorly-located well-defined
   hyperdense focus is unclear. The additional focus, along the right
   lateral aspect of the tentorium cerebelli, level of the ambient
   cistern, was not clearly present and also may represent evolving
   hemorrhage.
   - heparin gtt d/ced
   - MRI head c/w single punctuate hemorrhage, unclear as to relationship
   to mets which are not intraparenchymal
   - Consider repeat CT scan in several days to reassess bleeding, or
   earlier if clinical situation warrants.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: New-found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.  Most
   likely tachycardia induced.  Was diuresed on Lasix drip initially, now
   monitoring central pressures with swan, currently volume overloaded but
   CVP WNL.  Appears to have significant diuretic resistance.
   - monitor I
s & O
s, titrate diuresis to CVP
   - Given inability to maintain BP, will hold off on diuresis today.
   - continue statin
   - replace swan today pending family discussion of CMO
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**2148-11-4**] for increased work of
   breathing. Ventilatory support settings stable for days, but appears to
   becoming more hypoxic, unclear reason.  Likely secondary to volume
   overload, pneumonia and ARDS.
   - CXR this AM
   - titrate vent settings to ABGs, wean to CPAP as tolerated
   - Appreciate ID recs; switched from CTX
 vanc + CTZ + ciprofloxacin
   empirically for now.
   - await H1N1 results from government lab
   .
   # Fevers: (104.7 overnight) likely from influenza vs [**Location (un) 10939**] or related
   to suprainfection of pneumonia with gram negative rods in endotracheal
   suctioning.  Switched famotidine to PPI out of concern for drug fever.
   -Continue Oseltamivir, Ramantadine for influenza A
   - Continue ceftaz, cipro and vanc for HAP or VAP given GNRs in sputum
   - f/u blood and urine cultures as well as influenza H1N1 send out
   -F/U CXR from today
   .
   # [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell Carcinoma:  Initially diagnosed by elevated LDH and R
   axillary lymphadenopathy.  Imaging confirmed multiple nodules and
   intracranial/dural mets.  Pathology consistent with [**Location (un) 10939**] Cell
   Carcinoma, ie cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor.  Poor prognosis at this
   time per dermatology and oncology.
   - f/u Onc and derm recs, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**] recs
 likely no chemotherapy
   at this time
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Crit stable, s/p transfusion.  Labs not
   concerning for DIC at this time.
   - Daily crit, transfuse for <25.
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Crn stable at 2.4 today, likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from hypotension/shock.  UOP adequate.  No
   indications for dialysis at this time.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - follow UOP
   - diuresis as discussed above
   .
   # DMII: Last A1c in [**2-26**] was 7.4%. Will hold outpatient medications
   during this admission.   Sugars poorly controlled while in
patient,
   insulin drip intiated [**11-6**].
   - Continue Insulin drip
 requirements changing
   .
   # Asymmetric LE edema: now appears more symmetric.  Likely secondary to
   volume overload.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last
   lipid panel measured in [**11-24**]. Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
   Changed simvastatin 80mg PO daily to atorvastatin 40mg daily due to
   amiodarone presence and its potentiation of hepatotoxicity.
   - Follow LFT
   .
   # Arthritis: Stable though impossible to assess given mental status
   .
   # Gout: Stable.
   - Continue allopurinol 600mg PO daily; monitor renal function.
   .
   # Family Meeting:  Family updated daily.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and Merkel cell carcinoma. He was admitted for new onset rapid atrial fibrillation and severe cardiomyopathy.

The patient's current condition is critical, with several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has a mixed cardiogenic and distributive picture of shock. This could be due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, cardiomyopathy, metastatic carcinoma, and/or infection/sepsis from influenza A. The patient is currently only on norepinephrine and dopamine, and did not tolerate vasopressin. Pressor support should be continued.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is unresponsive to multiple attempts at cardioversion, likely secondary to increased sympathetic tone from both Merkel cell carcinoma and influenza A. The patient likely has a dilated cardiomyopathy that is either secondary to or worsened by the tachycardia. Amiodarone and digoxin will be continued, and the patient should be monitored for rate control.

3. Intracranial bleeds/Neurologic status: The patient's CT head c/contrast showed two new lesions (R frontal, R cerebellar) that were noted worrisome for metastasis vs. intraparenchymal"
