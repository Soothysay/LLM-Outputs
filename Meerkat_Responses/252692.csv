   Assessment and Plan
Acute respiratory failure: acute pulm edema with possible superimposed
   pneumonia. On empiric vanco and zosyn. To be dialysed. Would then wean
   Fio2 and PEEP and sedation as tolerated. Check ABG
 Arrest: this was not actually PEA, pt never received chest
   compressions. This may have been secondary to hyperkalemia/hypoxia, has
   been moving and not in a coma, not a candidate for cooling.
Hyperkalemia:  likely secondary to missing dialysis, now s/p HD, will
   follow up repeat K
 post HD K+ 3.7
HTN: will resume his home regimen, bblocker especially as he is having
   some ectopy
Dilated cardiomyopathy: resume bblocker
Diarrhea: send stool for C.diff
Access r/a in pm for likely placement of CVC.
? EtOH abuse: change versed to propofol also given renal failure. Tx
   with thiamine and folate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. They are also receiving arterial line monitoring and have been started on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of intermittent hypertension and is agitated, requiring increased sedation. They are on multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged, except for the conditions mentioned above. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below. The patient's vital signs indicate a high heart rate (104 bpm), high blood pressure (167/77 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (15 insp/min), and an oxygen saturation level of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 668 mL and an output of 120 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,252 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, set Vt of 550 mL, set RR of 16, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI deferred due to hemodynamic instability. The physical examination reveals clear lungs on the left side and rhonchorous on the right side. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (22.8 K/uL), low platelet count (238 K/uL"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia. They have been on invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring since December 26th, 02:34 AM and 04:19 AM respectively. The patient is experiencing intermittent hypertension and agitation, requiring increased sedation overnight. They have multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, renal failure, possible pneumonia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea and may have ethanol abuse issues. They are currently on various medications such as piperacillin/tazobactam, midazolam, fentanyl, dextrose, vancomycin, aspirin, insulin sliding scale, famotidine, heparin, and famotidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which can lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest that was not in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and did not require chest compressions. It could have been secondary to hyperkalemia or hypoxia.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
4. Pneumonia: The presence of multifocal infiltrates on chest"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure with multifocal infiltrates and edema on the chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and an arterial line.

The patient also has a history of cardiac arrest, likely secondary to hyperkalemia and hypoxia, but did not require chest compressions. The patient is not a candidate for cooling and is moving well without being in a coma.

There is an assessment for hyperkalemia, likely due to missed dialysis, which has been addressed with hemodialysis. The patient's hypertension will be managed by resuming their home regimen, especially considering episodes of ectopy.

The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and will resume beta-blocker therapy. Diarrhea is also present and a stool test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ordered.

Due to the need for ongoing access, placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) is being considered. The patient's alcohol abuse history is noted, and sedation will be changed from midazolam (versed) to propofol, along with administration of thiamine and folate, considering the patient's renal failure.

The patient's vital signs show intermittent hypertension, tachycardia, and an elevated temperature. The patient is deeply sedated and unresponsive, with normal muscle tone. Laboratory results indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, thin individual who presented to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. They were initially on mechanical ventilation but have been weaned to 40% Peep and 500 ml tidal volume with spontaneous breathing. The patient's family arrived, and a plan was made to attempt extubation in the morning. However, the patient became agitated at around 4am and required several doses of propofol as well as manual restraint. They were diaphoretic, tachypneic, and tachycardic in atrial fibrillation with aberrant conduction. Following this episode, no further attempts were made to wean the ventilator.

The patient has a history of multiple antibiotic administrations, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. They are currently receiving propofol infusions, famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 79-117 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/44 to 216/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,546 mL and an output of 5,100 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,554 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, poor dentition, normal heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and no skin assessment. Neurological examination is not assessed due to agitation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, elevated creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently on ICU care with plans for nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending extubation attempt."

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Respiratory Distress- Most likely due to volume overload and pulmonary
   edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Over last 24 hours able to
   remove 4L, however with ongoing agitation with lower sedation.
   Anticipate difficult weaning due to mental status.  His CXR looks
   markedly improved this morning and ABG look good on minimal support.
   - Plan to attempt extubation this afternoon; will d/c propofol after HD
   and attempt (unable to do RSBI [**12-26**] agitation)
   - Continue volume optimization with HD
   - Broad coverage antibiotics with Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given +
   sputum cultures
   - No additional lasix for now as getting 2KG removed via HD currently
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia - Presumed [**12-26**] to patient missing HD session over
   the weekend. His EKG consistent with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and
   peaked T waves. Pt is now s/p Calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate,
   and kayexalate.  Repeat EKG with improved QRS width.
   -Renal following
   - HD this AM
   - Continue Phos Lo
   -Repeat lytes this afternoon
   #Low Grade Temp- Etiology uncertain; no evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   although sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP
   rods. Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg
   -F/U repeat blood cultures this AM
   -Continue vanc/zosyn for now
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy
   -- Rate control with beta blocker, increase to 25mg TID
   -- Consider systemic anticoagulation once stable
   # [**Name (NI) 10699**] Pt with hypertensive urgency at OSH on nitro gtt; now weaned
   off; not clear if combination of medication non-compliance and/or
   missing HD session
   -Nitro gtt if needed
   -Titrate BB as needed
   .
   # H/O Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Unknown etiology; Previous Cardiac cath

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned overnight but experienced agitation and persistent hypertension. His condition is complicated by respiratory distress, ESRD/hyperkalemia, low-grade fever, and a possible previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, and ethanol use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. It is important to continue optimizing fluid balance with HD and closely monitor the patient's respiratory status.

2. ESRD/Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may be due to missing an HD session over the weekend. Immediate treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate, and kayexalate has been initiated to stabilize the patient's condition. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.

3. Low Grade Temperature: The etiology of the patient's low-grade temperature is uncertain. Further investigation is required, including repeat blood cultures and consultation with an infectious disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Respiratory Distress- Most likely due to volume overload and pulmonary
   edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Over last 24 hours able to
   remove 4L, however with ongoing agitation with lower sedation.
   Anticipate difficult weaning due to mental status
   - Continue propofol
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue volume optimization with HD
   - Broad coverage antibiotics with Vancomycin and Zosyn for now
   - F/U sputum cultures, per staff having thick secretions
   - No additional lasix for now as getting 2KG removed via HD currently
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia - Presumed [**12-26**] to patient missing HD session over
   the weekend. His EKG consistent with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and
   peaked T waves. Pt is now s/p Calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate,
   and kayexalate.  Repeat EKG with improved QRS width.

   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes)
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   -Follow EKG
   -Treat Hyperkalemia as above
   -Corrected hypoxia with intubation
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past
   -- Rate control with beta blocker, increase to 25mg TID
   -- Consider systemic anticoagulation once stable

The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator overnight but experienced persistent agitation and hypertension.

   days of missed HD. Probable respiratory arrest from acute CHF, unlikely
   PEA but presented with K>8. Active issues include fluid overload/ pulm
   edema, presumed aspiration pna, diarrhea, agitation and resolving
   metabolic disarray after missed HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with congestive pulmonary (CP) and dyspnea after several days of missed HD. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to respiratory failure. The plan includes continuing fluid removal per HD, following up with sputum culture, and continuing empiric vancomycin and Zosyn. Nicotine patches are also being used, and the patient will be extubated after HD this afternoon. Close monitoring for flash edema after removal of positive pressure vent is necessary.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation overnight, which may be related to his agitation. The plan includes controlling agitation, continuing beta-blockers, and potentially initiating anticoagulation in the future.

3. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with HD. Monitoring electrolyte levels is important in this context.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be managed with beta-blockers.

5. Diarrhea: Although Clostridium difficile toxin was negative, the patient has diarrhea. Further investigation and management are required.

6. Prior Ethanol Abuse: The patient has a history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation overnight but experienced persistent agitation and hypertension. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and takes 30mg of oxycodone per day at home.

Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient required large amounts of haloperidol (Haldol), lorazepam (Ativan), and diazepam (Valium) to manage his agitation. This may be due to opiate withdrawal or drug abuse history. Consider a psych consult and continue Haldol/Ativan as needed while monitoring QT interval.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient likely had volume overload and pulmonary edema due to malignant hypertension. Fluid removal was done after three rounds of HD, and he was extubated yesterday, showing improved respiratory status. Continue volume optimization with HD.
3. ESRD/Hyperkalemia: The patient missed an HD session over the weekend, leading to presumed hyperkalemia. His EKG showed widened QRS and peaked T waves. He received calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate, and kayexalate. Repeat EKG showed improved QRS width, and potassium levels are normal since HD. Hold on HD today per renal.
4. Low Grade Temperature: The patient had a low-grade fever with an uncertain etiology. No evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, although sputum cultures grew 1+ Grouped Pleomorphic Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ Gram-positive rods. Blood cultures are negative for Nongonococcal Gonococcal and Clostridium difficile. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for now.
5. s/p PEA: The patient experienced a possible pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, but it is unclear if he truly had a PEA arrest. He regained pulse without intervention. Differential includes hyperkalemia, hypoxia, cardiac causes. Three sets of cardiac enzymes are negative. Not clear about the events that occurred.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation during agitation overnight, which has not been documented before. He has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient is currently on intravenous metoprolol due to agitation and unable to take oral medications. Rate control with beta-blocker IV, switch to PO when able, and consider systemic anticoagulation once stable.
7. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient presented with hypertensive urgency at the outpatient setting on nitroglycerin (nit"

The patient's agitation required large amounts of haloperidol (Haldol), lorazepam (Ativan), and diazepam (Valium).

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), admitted with congestive pulmonary symptoms and dyspnea after missing several HD sessions. The patient presented with a probable respiratory arrest from acute congestive heart failure (CHF), but it is unlikely to be pulseless electrical activity (PEA) with potassium levels greater than 8. Active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia (PNA), diarrhea, agitation, and resolving metabolic disarray due to missed HD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - Pulmonary edema and possible PNA: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to fluid overload and pulmonic edema, along with the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. Continued fluid removal through HD, follow-up sputum culture, and continuing empiric vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics are recommended.
2. Agitation - Presumed opiate withdrawal: The patient's agitation is presumed to be due to opiate withdrawal, and escalating doses of Ativan and Haldol are being used for control. It is advised to use Haldol monotherapy, stop Ativan, and follow QTc. Psychiatric assistance should be sought, and a CT head may be required, possibly necessitating intubation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation - Predisposed with dilated CM: The patient's agitation also predis"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, valium and ativan. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home
   per day.  Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given
   strong ETOH/? Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs
   viral encephalopathy. Reintubated and sedated yesterday in order to
   manage agitation and obtain CT.  Preliiminary read negative
   -Psych following; apprciate recs: can give Haldol 5QID and 5QID prn, or
   switch to zyprexa if QT prolonged
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need to consider LP
   -F.U final read of CT
   #Respiratory Distress- Most likely due to volume overload and pulmonary
   edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Fluid removed after 3
   rounds of HD; extubated yesterday; improved respiratory status at this
   point.   Cultures c/w respiratory flora.  Now reintubated on [**12-28**] for
   agitation; but doing well on CPAP this AM. CXR this AM with possible
   aspiration pneumonia but currently covered broadly
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given + gram stain; complete 8
   day course (day #4)
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia - Presumed [**12-26**] to patient missing HD session over
   the weekend. His EKG consistent with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and
   peaked T waves. Pt is now s/p Calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate,
   and kayexalate.  Repeat EKG with improved QRS width.  Potassium wnl
   since HD

   #Low Grade Temp- Afebrile overnight. Presume fever was [**12-26**] pna on CXR.
    sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP rods.
   Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg. Overnight low grade 99.9.
   -F/U repeat blood cultures
   -Continue vanc/zosyn to complete 8 day course (complete on [**1-2**])
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy. Not
   requiring IV Lopressor overnight
   -- Rate control with beta blocker IV prn
   -- Consider systemic anticoagulation once stable
   # [**Name (NI) 10699**] Pt with hypertensive urgency at OSH on nitro gtt; now weaned
   off; not clear if combination of medication non-compliance and/or
   missing HD session
   -BP was low on proporfol gtt
   -will need oral agents restarted once extubated

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. The patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned overnight but remained persistently agitated and hypertensive.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Agitation: The patient has been persistently agitated and required large amounts of haloperidol (Haldol), lorazepam (Ativan), and diazepam (Valium). It is unclear if this agitation is due to opiate withdrawal or other causes such as stroke or viral encephalopathy. Psychiatric consultation has been requested.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is most likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. Fluids were removed after three rounds of HD, and the patient was extubated yesterday. However, the patient had to be reintubated on December 28th for agitation but is currently tolerating CPAP.

3. ESRD/Hyperkalemia: The patient is presumed to have missed a HD session over the weekend, leading to hyperkalemia. His EKG showed widened QRS and peaked T waves consistent with hyperkalemia. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The patient was successfully weaned from ventilatory support overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive. He was reintubated and sedated to manage agitation and obtain a CT scan, which showed no acute intracranial process. The patient's current condition includes agitation, respiratory distress, ESRD/hyperkalemia, low-grade fever, and a history of pulseless electrical activity (PEA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient's persistent agitation may lead to increased risk of injury or self-harm. Close monitoring and sedation management are necessary.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. Continued monitoring and management of fluid balance, oxygenation, and ventilation support are essential.
3. ESRD/Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, bicarbonate, and kayexalate. Ongoing renal follow-up and management of electrolyte imbalances are crucial.
4. Low-Grade Fever: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with congestive pulmonary symptoms and dyspnea after several days of missed HD. The patient's current medical issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal.

The patient was intubated yesterday for agitation. Psychiatric consultation was obtained, and a CT scan of the head was done. An echocardiogram (echo) was ordered.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 12/26/2169 at 10:51 AM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 12/28/2169 at 08:29 AM.

The patient is currently receiving Propofol infusion at 80 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications such as Lorazepam (Ativan) started on 12/28/2169 at 10:00 AM.

Other medications include ASA, RISS, Hep sc, thiamine, folate, Ca acetate, Requip, nicotine patch, haldol schedule, and Peridex.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/79 to 168/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. Imaging shows an ejection fraction of 70-80%.

The patient's plan includes continuing intubation for airway protection, monitoring for possible pneumonia, controlling agitation, managing hypertension, and restarting hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory arrest due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's agitation and inability to protect their airway.
3. Delirium and agitation, which may be caused by medication effects such as high doses of benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications.
4. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and fluid overload.
5. Renal complications due to the patient's end-stage renal disease and missed hemodialysis treatments.
6. Infection complications due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.
   Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/?
   Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral
   encephalopathy. Patients family interviewed again, have not found any
   evidence of other substance use. Other Ddx considerations include
   embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
   encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly
   unlikely, rules out bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.
   Lastly would need to consider anoxic injury although much less likely
   in patient with only transient PEA arrest.
   -Psych following; apprciate recs: can give Haldol 5QID and 5QID prn, or
   switch to zyprexa if QT prolonged
   - Wean down propofol as tolerated
   -F/U LP cultures
   - cont acyclovir until HSV PCR returns
   - F/U MRI
   #Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume overload and
   pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Now intubated for
   airway protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given + gram stain; complete 8
   day course (day #5)
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia
 Resolved now. On presentation Presumed [**12-26**] to
   patient missing HD session over the weekend. His EKG was consistent
   with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and peaked T waves
    - Continue Phos Lo
   #Low Grade Temp- Afebrile > 48hrs. Presume fever was [**12-26**] pna on CXR.
   sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP rods.
   Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg. Overnight low grade 99.9.
   -F/U repeat blood cultures
   -Continue vanc/zosyn to complete 8 day course (complete on [**1-2**])
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy.
   -- Rate control withdilt po and IV prn
   -- Continue heparin
   -- TSH
   # [**Name (NI) 10699**] Pt with hypertensive urgency at OSH on nitro gtt; now weaned
   off; not clear if combination of medication non-compliance and/or
   missing HD session
   -BP was low on proporfol gtt
   - cont dilt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on heparin for rate control. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and the patient was started on diltiazem for rate control. A lumbar puncture was performed, revealing 1 white blood cell (WBC), 1 red blood cell (RBC), and protein elevation. An MRI was also obtained. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is sedated with propofol. They have been agitated and required a large amount of sedation. The patient's family has been calling frequently for updates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure due to inadequate heart pumping.
2. The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes like hypoxia, infection, or medication side effects. Without proper assessment and treatment, it may progress to delirium or even coma.
3. The presence of right and left lower extremity edema suggests possible fluid overload or heart failure. This could lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart function.
4. The patient has hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which can result in cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest if not managed properly"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.
   Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/?
   Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral
   encephalopathy. Patients family interviewed again, have not found any
   evidence of other substance use. Other Ddx considerations include
   embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
   encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly
   unlikely, rules out bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.
   Lastly would need to consider anoxic injury although much less likely
   in patient with only transient PEA arrest.
   -Psych following; apprciate recs: can give Haldol 5QID and 5QID prn, or
   switch to zyprexa if QT prolonged
   - Wean down propofol as tolerated
   -F/U LP cultures
   - F/U MRI
   #Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume overload and
   pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Now intubated for
   airway protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given + gram stain; complete 8
   day course (day #5)
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia
 Resolved now. On presentation Presumed [**12-26**] to
   patient missing HD session over the weekend. His EKG was consistent
   with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and peaked T waves
    - Continue Phos Lo
   #Low Grade Temp- Afebrile > 48hrs. Presume fever was [**12-26**] pna on CXR.
   sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP rods.
   Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg. Overnight low grade 99.9.
   -F/U repeat blood cultures
   -Continue vanc/zosyn to complete 8 day course (complete on [**1-2**])
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy. Not
   requiring IV Lopressor overnight
   -- Rate control with beta blocker IV prn
   -- Continue heparin
   -- TSH
   # [**Name (NI) 10699**] Pt with hypertensive urgency at OSH on nitro gtt; now weaned
   off; not clear if combination of medication non-compliance and/or
   missing HD session
   -BP was low on proporfol gtt
   -will need oral agents restarted once extubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation overnight but remains agitated and hypertensive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient continues to be agitated, requiring large amounts of sedation. Possible causes include opiate withdrawal, stroke, viral encephalopathy, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation, encephalitis, or anoxic injury.

2. Respiratory Distress: Initially due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension, now intubated for airway protection and agitation. Vent settings need to be adjusted as tolerated.

3. ESRD/Hyperkalemia: Resolved now. The patient missed a dialysis session over the weekend, which led to hyperkalemia. The widened QRS and peaked T waves on his EKG were consistent with hyperkalemia. 

4. Low-Grade Fever: Presumed pneumonia on chest X-ray. Sputum cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and gram-positive rods. Blood cultures are negative for Nocardia and Clostridium difficile. The patient's temperature has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with confusion and dyspnea after several days of missed HD. The patient also has a high potassium level (>8), indicating possible respiratory arrest from acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Other active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal.

The patient underwent several interventions, including lumbapuncture with bland cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various medications such as heparin sodium, propofol, acyclovir, vancomycin, haloperidol (Haldol), and famotidine (Pepcid).

The vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 63 bpm (range: 63-141 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 125/62 mmHg (range: 87/33-204/80 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (range: 8-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with congestive pulmonary symptoms and dyspnea after missing several HD sessions. The patient presented with high potassium levels and is suspected to have had an acute heart failure (CHF) episode with a probable respiratory arrest, although pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is unlikely. Active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal.

24-hour events:
- EKG showed a prolonged QTc interval.
- Lumbar puncture revealed 2 white blood cells, 1 red blood cell, and a protein level of 41 mg/dL.
- The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
- The patient received fentanyl for agitation but was switched to increased doses of haloperidol (Haldol) and removed from fentanyl.
- The patient experienced desaturation to 80% overnight after the MRI but improved rapidly without any changes in the chest X-ray.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Infusions:
- Heparin sodium at a rate of 1,150 units/hour.
- Propofol.
- Acyclovir.
- Vancomycin.

   59 yo ESRD on HD, dilated CM, admitted w/ CP and dyspnea after several
   days of missed HD. Probable respiratory arrest from acute CHF, unlikely
   PEA but presented with K>8. Active issues include fluid overload/ pulm
   edema, presumed aspiration pna, diarrhea, and agitated delirium.
   (1) AGITATION-DDx includes encephalitis, toxic/metabolic, med effect
   (Requip, high dose benzos). Encephalitis, meningitis much less likely
   now in light of normal LP.  Follow up read or MRI today for ? stroke.
   Also ? possibility of anoxic injury during preadmission event.
   -Haldol scheduled, and will try to wean propofol-EKG q shift for QTc
   -LP:  CSF is bland with 1 rbc and 2 wbc, ptn 41, glc 68
   -MRI read pending
   -cont intubation for airway protection, daily SBT
   -check TG levels given high-dose propofol
   (2) POSSIBLE PNA- completing empiric 8d course vanco + Zosyn,
   respiratory status now stable.  Keep intubated for mental status until
   we can successfully wean off prop.
   (3) AFIB- predisposed w/ dilated atrium; current agitation. Responded
   well to dilt, anticoagulating with heparin
   (4) ESRD- back on HD
   -monitor lytes
   (5) HTN- well controlled now on diltiazem

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with confusion and dyspnea after missing several days of HD and was admitted to the ICU. The patient also has dilated cardiomyopathy (CM) and experienced respiratory arrest from acute congestive heart failure (CHF), although pulmonary embolism and airway obstruction were less likely.

Active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require close monitoring.

The patient has several medical conditions that require attention:
1. Agitation: The patient is agitated, and the differential diagnosis includes encephalitis, toxic/metabolic effects, and medication effects such as Requip and high-dose benzodiazepines. Encephalitis and meningitis are less likely now that the lumbar puncture (LP) results are normal. Follow-up MRI is planned to rule out stroke or anoxic injury during the preadmission event. Haldol has been scheduled, and an attempt will be made to wean off propofol. EKGs will be done every shift to monitor QTc levels.
2. Possible pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a history of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted with confusion and dyspnea after missing several hemodialysis sessions. The patient presented with a potassium level higher than 8, which is concerning. Active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AGITATION: The patient's agitation could be due to encephalitis, toxic/metabolic causes, or medication effects (Requip, high-dose benzodiazepines). The plan includes using Haldol monotherapy, stopping Ativan, and following up on the QTc interval. An LP (lumbar puncture) and empiric acyclovir treatment have been planned. An MRI is pending. The patient will continue to be intubated for airway protection, with daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The plan also includes checking triglyceride levels due to high-dose propofol use.

2. POSSIBLE PNA: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected pneumonia. 

3. AFIB: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is predisposed by a dilated atrium. The plan is to control agitation and switch"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with confusion and dyspnea after missing several days of HD. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypertension (HTN), and presumed aspiration pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's current medical issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and possible opiate withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/62 to 204/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (K>8), elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 14.3-235 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 6.5-8.9 mg/dL), and elevated lactate acid levels (1.6 mmol/L). The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a prolonged QTc interval of 460-480 ms.

The patient's plan includes continuing with aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotic therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia, daily sedation vacation trials, and weaning off propofol. The patient will also receive haloperidol for agitation, continue with heparin anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and resume hemodialysis for ESRD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression, and cardiac complications related to atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy."

   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.
   Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/?
   Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral
   encephalopathy. Patients family interviewed again, have not found any
   evidence of other substance use. Other Ddx considerations include
   embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
   encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly
   unlikely, rules out bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.
   Lastly would need to consider anoxic injury although much less likely
   in patient with only transient PEA arrest.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital for shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The patient was successfully weaned overnight but remained persistently agitated and hypertensive.

The patient's medical history includes a previous cardiac catheterization in 2164 without evidence of coronary disease. He also has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology. 

The patient's current medications include Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Acyclovir, Heparin Sodium, Diltiazem, Propofol, Fentanyl, Haloperidol (Haldol), and Phos Lo.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate 80 bpm (with a range of 1-128 bpm), blood pressure 176/68 mmHg (with a range of 95-191/45-112 mmHg), respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute (with a range of 9-23 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 97%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (14.3-228"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned from ventilatory support overnight but remained persistently agitated and hypertensive.

The patient's medical history includes a previous cardiac catheterization without evidence of coronary disease, atrial fibrillation, and dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology. He also has a history of alcohol and drug abuse.

On admission, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 176/68 to 191/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient was sedated and withdrew from pain.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial infection. Electrolyte imbalances included hyperkalemia.

The patient's diagnosis includes atrial fibrillation, altered mental status (not delirium), tachycardia, airway protection risk, hypertension, cardiac arrest, and hyperkalemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and admitted with congestive pulmonary symptoms and dyspnea after missing several days of HD. The patient's condition is complicated by fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and possible opiate withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/68 mmHg to 191/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (K>8), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or show mild abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's active issues include fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, and agitated delirium. The agitation is attributed to multiple causes such as encephalitis, toxic/metabolic"

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple active issues including fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal.

24-hour events include continued agitation, EKG changes, and various medication infusions. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support on CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, but labs show elevated potassium levels, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Agitation - Differential diagnosis includes encephalitis, toxic/metabolic effects, and medication effects. Holding Haldol due to QTc prolongation. Considering weaning off propofol and starting Precipice per psychiatry recommendations. Consult neurology if mental status does not improve.
2. Possible PNA - Completing an 8-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn. Intubation will be continued until mental status improves and propofol can be weaned off.
3. AFIB - Agitation responded well to diltiazem. Anticoagulating with heparin. Weaning off diltiazem today and starting po"

   PEA but presented with K>8. Active issues include fluid overload/ pulm
   edema, presumed aspiration pna, diarrhea, and agitated delirium.
   (1) AGITATION-DDx includes encephalitis, toxic/metabolic, med effect
   (Requip, high dose benzos). Encephalitis, meningitis much less likely
   now in light of normal LP.  MRI negative.  Also ? possibility of anoxic
   injury during preadmission event, but no evidence of this on MRI
   -holding haldol for now due to QTc of .5
   -LP:  CSF is bland with 1 rbc and 2 wbc, ptn 41, glc 68
   -try to wean propofol and start precidex today per psychiatry recs.  If
   this does not lead to improved mental status and extubation then will
   consider neurology consult +/- EEG
   -cont intubation for airway protection, daily SBT
   -check TG levels given high-dose propofol
   (2) POSSIBLE PNA- completing empiric 8d course vanco + Zosyn,
   respiratory status now stable.  Keep intubated for mental status until
   we can successfully wean off prop.
   (3) AFIB- predisposed w/ dilated atrium; current agitation. Responded

","The patient is a 59-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), and a history of congestive heart failure (CHF). They were admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea after missing several hemodialysis sessions. The patient presented with high potassium levels (>8), fluid overload/pulmonary edema, presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and possible opiate withdrawal.

Key findings from the 24-hour event sheet include:
- EKG readings showing QTc changes.
- Vital signs indicating stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- Hemodynamic monitoring showing a positive fluid balance.
- Review of systems unchanged from admission, except for the addition of diarrhea.
- Physical examination revealing intubation, sedation, unresponsiveness, constricted pupils, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, soft abdomen, no extremity edema, and unresponsive neurologic status.
- Labs showing elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, high creatinine, normal glucose levels, and other abnormal lab values.
- Imaging studies including a normal MRI.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient's agitation may be due to encephalitis, toxic/metabolic causes, or medication effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient on hemodialysis (HD) with dilated cardiomyopathy (CM), who was admitted with congestive pulmonary (CP) and dyspnea after missing several HD sessions. The patient presented with probable respiratory arrest from acute congestive heart failure (CHF), possible presumed aspiration pneumonia, diarrhea, agitation, and presumptive opiate withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/68 mmHg to 191/87 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 12 to 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen, and a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including heparin sodium, diltiazem, propofol, fentanyl, diltiazem, propofol, and haloperidol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of diarrhea.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated potassium levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal renal function tests.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the fact that certain assessments were not conducted, such as peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, neurologic examination, and respiratory support.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo ESRD on HD, dilated CM, admitted w/ CP and dyspnea after several
   days of missed HD. Probable respiratory arrest from acute CHF, unlikely
   PEA but presented with K>8. Active issues include fluid overload/ pulm
   edema, presumed aspiration pna, diarrhea, and agitated delirium.
   (1) AGITATION-DDx includes encephalitis, toxic/metabolic, med effect
   (Requip, high dose benzos). Encephalitis, meningitis much less likely
   now in light of normal LP.  Follow up read or MRI today for ? stroke.
   Also ? possibility of anoxic injury during preadmission event.
   -Haldol scheduled, and will try to wean propofol-EKG q shift for QTc
   -LP:  CSF is bland with 1 rbc and 2 wbc, ptn 41, glc 68
   -MRI read pending
   -cont intubation for airway protection, daily SBT
   -check TG levels given high-dose propofol
   (2) POSSIBLE PNA- completing empiric 8d course vanco + Zosyn,
   respiratory status now stable.  Keep intubated for mental status until
   we can successfully wean off prop.
   (3) AFIB- predisposed w/ dilated atrium; current agitation. Responded
   well to dilt, anticoagulating with heparin
   (4) ESRD- back on HD
   -monitor lytes
   (5) HTN- well controlled now on diltiazem

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol. Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.
   Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/?
   Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral
   encephalopathy. Patients family interviewed again, have not found any
   evidence of other substance use. Other Ddx considerations include
   embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
   encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly
   unlikely, rules out bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI
   done also without evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute
   pathology.
   -Psych following
   -Given prlonged qt changed to zyprexa for agitation
   -Using precedex and weaning iof propofol
   -Use zyprexa prn
   - cont acyclovir until HSV PCR returns
   - neuro consult today
   #Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume overload and
   pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Now intubated for
   airway protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum
   - Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given + gram stain; complete 8
   day course (day #[**5-31**])
   - Attempt precedex per psych given MS for alternate sedation
   - Check Triglycerides given prolonged use of propofol
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia
 Resolved now. On presentation Presumed [**12-26**] to
   patient missing HD session over the weekend. His EKG was consistent
   with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and peaked T waves
    - Continue Phos Lo
   - Renal following
   #Low Grade Temp- Afebrile > 48hrs. Presume fever was [**12-26**] pna on CXR.
   sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP rods.
   Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg. Overnight low grade 99.9.
   -F/U repeat blood cultures
   -Continue vanc/zosyn to complete 8 day course (complete on [**1-2**])
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Currently weaned off dilt gtt
   -Continue PO diltizem 90 QID will add Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 TID and
   titrate prn
   -- Continue heparin and coumadin
   - Check coags

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. The patient presented to the hospital for shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The patient was successfully weaned overnight but continued to be agitated and hypertensive.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. Now, the patient is intubated for airway protection and agitation. Vent settings are being kept at a minimum.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient had presumed missing HD sessions over the weekend, which led to hyperkalemia evident on EKG with widened QRS and peaked T waves. It is important to continue Phos Lo to prevent hyperphosphatemia and renal following.

3. Low-grade fever: The patient had a low-grade fever, which was initially presumed to be pneumonia. Sputum cultures grew 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ gram-positive rods. Blood cultures were negative for N gonorrhoeae and Clostridium difficile. The patient's temperature has been afebrile for"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol, self extubated this AM ahead of planned extubation.
   Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.  Unclear if
   agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse
   history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral encephalopathy.
   Patients family interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
   substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic phenomena from
   atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral),
   withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly unlikely, rules out
   bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI done also without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.
   -Psych following
   -Given prlonged qt changed to zyprexa for agitation
   - Acyclovir / Vanco / Zosyn
   - Weaning precedex rapidly now post extubation
   -Use zyprexa prn
   #Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume overload and
   pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Now intubated for
   airway protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum
   - Completed course with Vancomycin and Zosyn for now given + gram
   stain; complete 8 day course (day #[**7-1**])
   - Attempt precedex per psych given MS for alternate sedation
   - Check Triglycerides given prolonged use of propofol
   # ESRD/Hyperkalemia
 Resolved now. On presentation Presumed [**12-26**] to
   patient missing HD session over the weekend. His EKG was consistent
   with hyperkalemia; widened QRS and peaked T waves
    - Continue Phos Lo
   - Renal following
   #Low Grade Temp- Afebrile > 48hrs. Presume fever was [**12-26**] pna on CXR.
   sputum growing 1+ GP cocci in pairs/chains/clusters and 1+ GP rods.
   Blood cultures NGTD and C.Diff neg. Overnight low grade 99.9.
   -F/U repeat blood cultures
   -Continue vanc/zosyn to complete 8 day course (complete on [**1-2**])
   # s/p PEA [**Name (NI) 10698**] Unclear if patient truly had PEA arrest; documented
   that he lost pulse briefly but no CPR was done; pt given supplemental
   Oxygen/NRB and pulses regained without intervention. PEA documented at
   2204 this evening.  Differential includes hyperkalemia vs hypoxia
   (pulmary edema/respiratory distress) vs cardiac (initial symptoms of
   Chest pain, EKG changes). 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative.  Not
   clear events that occurred.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Noted during agitation overnight, not documented
   to have this in the past. Pt does have h/o dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Currently weaned off dilt gtt
   -- Transition from  PO diltizem 90 QID decrease to 30mg to increase

   # [**Name (NI) 10699**] Pt with hypertensive urgency at OSH on nitro gtt; now weaned
   off; not clear if combination of medication non-compliance and/or
   missing HD session
   -- Continue dilt, titrate down to 30mg daily
   -- metoprolol increase to 50mg TID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. 

The patient was successfully weaned overnight but continued to experience agitation and hypertension. He self-extubated ahead of planned extubation. The family reported that he takes 30mg of oxycodone per day at home, which raises the possibility of opiate withdrawal contributing to his agitation. Other differential diagnoses considered include stroke, viral encephalopathy, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis, withdrawal, and other acute pathologies.

The patient was given prolonged QT changed to zyprexa for agitation and continued on acyclovir, vancomycin, and Zosyn. He is being weaned off precedex rapidly now post-extubation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient self-extubated but remains on propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and altered mental status, which is likely related to toxic metabolic effects from medication. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and their chest X-ray is clear. Antibiotics have been discontinued as there is no evidence of pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with lopressor and diltiazem, and clonidine will be considered if the blood pressure remains elevated. The patient's nutrition is currently nil per os (NPO), pending a speech-language pathology evaluation. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and pneumonia is essential.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin, which increases the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful management of any bleeding episodes are necessary.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history"

   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol, self extubated yesterday ahead of planned extubation.
   Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.  Unclear if
   agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse
   history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral encephalopathy.
   Patients family interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
   substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic phenomena from
   atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral),
   withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly unlikely, rules out
   bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI done also without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.
- He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and pulmonary edema.
- The patient was successfully weaned overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive.
- He self-extubated during rounds and required precedex, which was weaned off and is now quiet on zyprexa.
- The patient has an altered mental status, tachycardia, airway protection issues, diarrhea, hypertension, and a history of cardiac arrest.
- He also has hyperkalemia and is on hemodialysis.
- The patient's family denies any evidence of substance use, but other differential diagnoses include stroke, viral encephalopathy, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation, encephalitis, withdrawal, etc.
- The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, and his atrial fibrillation is not documented previously.
- He was on nitro gtt at OSH and is now weaned off.
- The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, but it is unclear if he truly had a PEA arrest. He regained pulses without intervention and was given supplemental oxygen/NRB.
- The events leading up to the arrest are unclear, with possible causes including hyperk"

   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol, self extubated this AM ahead of planned extubation.
   Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.  Unclear if
   agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse
   history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral encephalopathy.
   Patients family interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
   substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic phenomena from
   atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral),
   withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly unlikely, rules out
   bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI done also without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive. The patient self-extubated in the morning and required precedex after extubation, which was then rapidly weaned off.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB), altered mental status (not delirium), tachycardia (other), inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough), alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, benign hypertension, cardiac arrest, hyperkalemia (high potassium), and ESRD/Hyperkalemia.

The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans:
1. AFIB: The patient has a history of AFIB, which is currently being managed.
2. Agitation: The patient is persistently agitated and requires sedation with haloperidol and propofol. Opiate withdrawal may be a contributing factor.
3. Respiratory Distress: Initially due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. Now intubated for airway protection and agitation. Vent settings at minimum.

   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol, self extubated this AM ahead of planned extubation.
   Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.  Unclear if
   agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse
   history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral encephalopathy.
   Patients family interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
   substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic phenomena from
   atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral),
   withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly unlikely, rules out
   bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI done also without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive. The patient self-extubated in the morning ahead of planned extubation. He has a history of alcohol and drug abuse but denies current substance use. Other differential diagnoses include stroke, viral encephalopathy, withdrawal, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral), and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient had an unplanned extubation, indicating a risk for aspiration and altered airway clearance due to agitation.
2. Alteration in Elimination: The patient has diarrhea, which may be related to altered elimination.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation during agitation overnight. This is a potential complication that requires management.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, although it is unclear if he truly had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest or not.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia upon admission, which has since resolved.
6. Hypertension:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient experienced an unplanned extubation at 09:50 AM on 01/01/2170. The patient is agitated and delirious, but well managed with zyprexa. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received acyclovir and piperacillin on 12/30/2169 and 12/31/2169 respectively.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a current temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), a heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 75-100 bpm, a blood pressure of 183/59 mmHg (166/59-195/98 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 12-27 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.3 thousand/mm³, a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, a platelet count of 308 thousand/mm³, a creatinine level of 9.4 mg/dL, and a blood glucose level of 103 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided, including elevated levels of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient had recurrent AFIB this morning. The plan is to titrate up metoprolol to 100 mg three times daily and continue diltiazem. Coumadin will be held until the patient is no longer at risk for falls.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient remains confused but less agitated on zyprexa. It is planned to continue zyprexa as needed.
3. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): This issue is resolved.
4. Hypertension, benign: The plan is to continue lopressor and titrate it up. Clonidine will be increased to 0.2 mg from 0.1 mg.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamer will be resumed.

ICU Care:

- Nutrition: The plan is to slowly advance the patient's diet.
- Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits.
- Lines: The patient has a multi-lumen line inserted on 12/28/2169 at 06:45 PM.
- Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis is not indicated.
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving appropriate communication and care.
- Code status: The patient's code status is full code.
- Disposition: The patient is to remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided in the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potential complications such as stroke.
2. Persistent altered mental status and confusion, which may increase the risk of falls and other injuries.
3. Hypertension that is not adequately controlled, leading to potential complications like heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
4. Hyperphosphatemia, which can contribute to renal dysfunction and bone demineralization.
5. Risk of aspiration due to inability to protect the airway, potentially leading to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Please note that these potential complications"

   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation / Delirium: Patient persistently agitated, still requiring
   large amounts of haldol, propofol. Likely large component of ICU
   psychosis, Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.
   Unclear if agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/?
   Drug abuse history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral
   encephalopathy. Patients family interviewed again, have not found any
   evidence of other substance use. Other Ddx considerations include
   embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation of unknown duration,
   encephalitis (viral), withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly
   unlikely, rules out bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI
   done also without evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute
   pathology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.
- He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. He was successfully weaned overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive.
- The patient's family reports that he takes 30mg of oxycodone per day at home, and it is unclear if his agitation is due to opiate withdrawal.
- Other differential diagnoses include stroke, viral encephalopathy, withdrawal, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation, encephalitis, and drug abuse.
- The patient had an MRI that ruled out anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.
- He was given a psychiatric consult and switched from haloperidol to risperidone for agitation.
- The patient initially had respiratory distress due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension, as well as pneumonia. He was extubated one day later.
- He completed a course of Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia.
- The patient's ESRD and hyperkalemia have been resolved, and he is scheduled for hemodialysis today.
- He also has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and was found to have atrial fibrillation but it resolves after hemodialysis.

   59 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, dilated cardiomyopathy & HTN presented
   to OSH for shortness of breath and found to have hyperkalemia with QRS
   changes, hypertension and pulmonary edema, successfully weaned
   overnight however with persistant agitation and hypertension
   #Agitation- Patient persistantly agitated requiring large amounts of
   haldol, propofol, self extubated yesterday ahead of planned extubation.
   Per pts PCP he takes 30mg oxycodone at home per day.  Unclear if
   agitation due to withdrawal from opiates given strong ETOH/? Drug abuse
   history.  Other ddx may include stroke vs viral encephalopathy.
   Patients family interviewed again, have not found any evidence of other
   substance use. Other Ddx considerations include embolic phenomena from
   atrial fibrillation of unknown duration, encephalitis (viral),
   withdrawal, etc. LP makes HSV encephalitis highly unlikely, rules out
   bacterial meningitis, CT head without bleed.  MRI done also without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other acute pathology.

   -Given prlonged qt changed to zyprexa 5mg for agitation q6 prn
   #Respiratory Distress-Initially most likely due to volume overload and
   pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension. Also with
   pneumonia, now extubated x1 day.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have hyperkalemia with QRS changes, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The patient successfully weaned overnight but remained agitated and hypertensive.

The patient's family reported that he takes 30mg of oxycodone per day at home, which may be related to his agitation. Other differential diagnoses considered include stroke, viral encephalopathy, embolic phenomena from atrial fibrillation, encephalitis, withdrawal, and more.

The patient initially experienced respiratory distress due to volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of malignant hypertension. He also had pneumonia, for which he completed a course of Vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's ESRD and hyperkalemia were resolved after he received hemodialysis.

The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and was weaned off diltiazem gtt. He continues on metoprolol 75mg TID and diltiazem 30mg QID. His blood pressure remains uncontrolled, so the dose of metoprolol will be increased to 100mg q6.

The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's mental status has improved but remains delirious. The patient is currently on multiple medications including Zyprexa, nicotine patch, sevalamer, diltiazem, metoprolol, MVI, folate, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.9 C (100.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 157/49-183/87 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on respiratory support with no oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of 29. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to tactile stimuli, and has normal tone. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Creatinine levels are within normal range. Other lab results include elevated potassium and magnesium levels, as well as slightly low calcium and phosphate levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): Continue lopressor and diltiazem for good control currently. Discontinue lopressor and change to nadolol, which is a home medication.
