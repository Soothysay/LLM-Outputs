   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - INR 1.6 this am
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for hosp organisms Asp PNA
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   - overbreathing [**Hospital **] this am, last pCO2 in low 30s, sedation increased
   -if possible, send sputum cx
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotension ddx sepsis versus hypovolemia versus
   cardiogenic shock.  Elevated lactate at 3 on ABG and bloody secretions
   from mouth and ETT.

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Baseline hct around 30 and hct currently at 20.  Pt is getting 2units
   prbcs now and GI planning EGD in pm
   - tranfuse 2units now for goal hct >25
   - bolus IVF
   - correct INR with FFP, Vit K 10mg now

   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - continue cycling CE
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - monitor EKG daily
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the 1.2-1.5
   range, currently 2.9.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed but may also
   have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  ddx includes
   prerenal [**1-6**] volume down vs sepsis, also ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI
   - Cr did not improve c volume repletion
   - monitor UOP, very low o/n
   - check UA, prot/creatinine: Creat:44, TotProt:132, Prot/Cr:3.0
   - renally dose all meds
   -consider urine sediment
   - will get renal ultrasound
   .
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG from 15.5-->14.5 c resolution of elevated lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   -lactate wnl by yesterday evening
   - resume sodium bicarb [**Hospital1 **] (home regimen) if acidosis does not respond
   to resuscitation

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and Alzheimer's disease. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. EGD showed reflux esophagitis. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. The hypotension could be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. The patient has elevated lactate levels and bloody secretions from the mouth and endotracheal tube. The gastrointestinal bleeding may be due to diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. The patient received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage worsens.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen if the underlying cause, such as sepsis or hypovolemia, is not adequately treated.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and active bleeding indicate ongoing coagulopathy. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially if the INR remains elevated.
4. Acute Renal"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and Alzheimer's disease. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (acute), and impaired skin integrity.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may have had an underlying event such as hypotension, aspiration of bloody gastric materials, or pulmonary hemorrhage. She is on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypovolemic due to GI bleed, and there may be an additional component of sepsis. She is being given intravenous fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

3. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient has a history of diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. She presented with blood around her mouth, an INR of 10, and a baseline hematocrit (Hct) around 30%. She received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). An EGD will be performed later to identify the source of bleeding.

4. Leukocytosis/Neutrophilia: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Sputum cultures are pending, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

5. CAD/Elevated Troponin: The patient's EKGs appear normal, and her elevated troponin levels are likely due to strain from hypotension, bradycardia, and GI bleed.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were in the range of 1.2-1.5, but they have now increased to 2.9. She is hypovolemic due to GI bleed and may have a component of sepsis. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal volume depletion versus sepsis, as well as acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

7. Elevated Anion Gap: The patient's anion gap is elevated, likely due to acute renal failure and lactic acidosis. This condition should be monitored, and sodium bicarbonate may be resumed if acidosis does not respond to resuscitation.

8. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) s/p CVA: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being held due to her active GI bleed"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, and an endoscopy showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient's current medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She also has impaired skin integrity.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors, including the aspiration of bloody gastric materials, possible pulmonary hemorrhage, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and frequent assessment of respiratory status are necessary to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia from the ongoing GI bleeding. Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is crucial. Fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. The patient was transferred from another hospital, where she was intubated and on pressors.

Current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy did not show any active bleeding. Therefore, the current vent settings will be continued.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure was resuscitated with 8 liters of normal saline. There is some evidence of septic physiology, so cultures will be monitored.
3. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and the INR has decreased to 1.6. Coumadin will be held, and enzymes related to cardiac damage will be checked. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will also be performed.
4. Acute Renal Failure: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected, and urine will be sent for casts. The patient is becoming more acidemic.

   TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal
   inferior and inferoseptum hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis. There is
   abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. The
   end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
   pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.

   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.

   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotension ddx sepsis versus hypovolemia versus
   cardiogenic shock.  Elevated lactate at 3 on ABG and bloody secretions
   from mouth and ETT.
   - still on dopa drip as of yesterday
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr, improving
   - check TTE to r/o cardiogenic
   .
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the 1.2-1.5
   range, currently 2.9.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed but may also
   have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  ddx includes
   prerenal [**1-6**] volume down vs sepsis, also ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She was intubated and placed on pressors. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis/neutrophilia, elevated troponin levels indicating possible CAD, elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation after CVA, and potential fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema. She requires mechanical ventilation and is showing signs of septic shock with hypotension and elevated lactate levels. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. It is important to maintain adequate intravascular volume and monitor for any signs of organ hypoperfusion.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.5 and currently elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. The patient was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was intubated and placed on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and elevated anion gap.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/61 mmHg to 74/20 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal cardiac enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal mild dilation of the left atrium and right atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and moderate dilation of"

She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 0.4 and has severe tricuspid regurgitation. She also has a history of acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 117/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac output of 5.0 L/min and a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. She has received a total of 1,315 mL of fluids since admission and has had a urine output of 340 mL. Her blood gases indicate a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 582 mmHg, and HCO3- of 19 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is oxygenating well, but there is a plan to lighten sedation and switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV). This suggests that the respiratory failure may improve with this intervention.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a dilated right ventricle (RV) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), indicating possible right heart strain. Dopamine infusion has been reduced to 4.5 mcg/kg/min, which may help improve blood pressure.
3. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient's INR is stable, suggesting that the bleeding may have been controlled. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that the INR remains within therapeutic range.
4. CAD/Elevated Troponin: Troponin levels are stable, indicating that there may not be ongoing myocardial damage. However, close monitoring is still required due to the patient's history of CAD.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to bloody/brown secretions coming from the mouth and frank blood being suctioned from the endotracheal tube (ETT). This could indicate aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. She has elevated lactate levels on arterial blood gas (ABG), suggesting possible lactic acidosis. She is still on a dopamine drip and receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.5, which has increased to 3.2. She is hypovolemic due to GI bleeding but may also have a component of sepsis. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia due to volume depletion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and renal consult is considered.

4. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient has known diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids and presented with blood around her mouth. She received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and continues to be hypotensive. EGD did not reveal an active source of bleeding, and she is currently stable without active bleeding.

5. Leukocytosis/Neutrophilia: The patient has leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Cultures are being followed up, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

6. CAD/Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to strain in the setting of hypotension, bradycardia, and GI bleed. She appears to have had an NSTEMI/demand ischemia.

7. Elevated Anion Gap:"

   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 4)- holding
   vanco dose as supratherapeutic today
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   - acidosis is largely secondary to metabolic acidosis from renal
   failure/lactic acidosis; administered bicarbonate yesterday (is on
   bicarb at home)
   -sputum cx showed gram positive cocci; pt also positive for MRSA.
   Covering with vanc/zosyn/cipro; loculated pleural effusion on CXR; no
   thoracentesis at this time- will await change with diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock.  Elevated lactate (1.2 to 7 yesterday). Possibly due
   to period of hypoperfusion when hypotensive yesterday AM.
   -CE added onto labs from  yesterday AM and were still trending down.
   -Possible gut ischemia leading to elevated lactate, secondary to
   levophed use?
   - Would consider CT chest/abd
   - still on vasopressin and levophed, weaned off dopamine [**1-6**] afib. Will
   switch to phenylephrine and if still hypotensive, vasopressin.
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only with total fluids positive at 1L
   (want to avoid exacerbation of anasarca)
   -trend ABG's Q3 hour
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 3.4.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed but
   may also have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  ddx
   includes prerenal [**1-6**] volume down vs sepsis, also ATN. Pt does appear
   to also have a component of CRI
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -not a good HD candidate
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Hct stable at 30. EGD with no active source of bleeding.
   - not actively bleeding, does have guaiac pos stool
   - maintain active type and screen
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   #Elevated LFT's- likely [**1-6**] ischemia
   - will trend for resolution and maintain MAPs>65
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG is 17 this AM, with downward trending lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   -lactate wnl by yesterday evening
   - sodium bicarb administration to maintain pH above 7.3-7.35 so as to
   maintain environment in which pressors are active
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, check INR today; last INR was 1.4
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   -holding dopamine with resolution of afib
   .
   #Skin sloughing: f/u wound care recs
   .
   # Edema: Anasarca of likely due to poor nutrition status but also
   losing protein in urine.
   - on tube feeds; nutrition following

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and placed on pressors. The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and was recently admitted with an aspiration pneumonitis treated with Ertapenem. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP mode, which suggests ongoing respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and signs of organ dysfunction indicate possible sepsis. Empiric antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is elevated, and her current creatinine level is 3.4. She is oliguric, hypovolemic due to GI bleed, and may have sepsis-related acute kidney injury (AKI). Further evaluation with renal ultrasounds and close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is necessary"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She developed worsening acidosis ( metabolic) concerning for as yet
   another septic focus. She has need IV HCO3 and is 4L positive even over
   the past 24 hours with weeping anasarca. She is barely arousable on the
   ventilator but currently in NSR on low dose vasopressin. She will have
   a CT of her chest/abd to assess for loculated pleural effusions and r/o
   intra-abdominal abcess. Flagyl has been added for presumptive C.
   Difficile. She is anuric and would benefit from RRT but is unstable to
   tolerate this. Prognosis is grave and family will be updated.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated and is on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, diabetes mellitus type II, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, lactate, troponin, and liver enzymes. The patient's imaging shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions and an enlarged heart size.

The patient's medications include vasopressin, phenylephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, sodium bicarbonate, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of sepsis with organ dysfunction, worsening renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis, and pressure ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and placed on pressors. An upper endoscopy showed reflux esophagitis.

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, elevated INR, and elevated troponin levels. She also has impaired skin integrity and anasarca.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/82 mmHg to 67/14 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes, lactate, and troponin T levels. Imaging shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions and an enlarged heart size.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, phenylephrine, sodium bicarbonate, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, vancom"

   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 4)- holding
   vanco dose as supratherapeutic today
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   - acidosis is largely secondary to metabolic acidosis from renal
   failure/lactic acidosis; administered bicarbonate yesterday (is on
   bicarb at home)
   -sputum cx showed gram positive cocci; pt also positive for MRSA.
   Covering with vanc/zosyn/cipro; loculated pleural effusion on CXR; no
   thoracentesis at this time- will await change with diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock.  Elevated lactate (1.2 to 7 yesterday). Possibly due
   to period of hypoperfusion when hypotensive yesterday AM.
   -CE added onto labs from  yesterday AM and were still trending down.
   -Possible gut ischemia leading to elevated lactate, secondary to
   levophed use?
   - Would consider CT chest/abd
   - still on vasopressin; levophed and dopamine weaned off
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only minimally; will rely mostly on
   pressors
   -trend ABG's Q3 hour
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 3.4.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed but
   may also have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  ddx
   includes prerenal [**1-6**] volume down vs sepsis, also ATN. Pt does appear
   to also have a component of CRI
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -not a good HD candidate
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Hct stable at 30. EGD with no active source of bleeding.
   - not actively bleeding, does have guaiac pos stool
   - maintain active type and screen
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   #Elevated LFT's- likely [**1-6**] ischemia
   - will trend for resolution and maintain MAPs>65
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG is 17 this AM, with downward trending lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   - sodium bicarb administration to maintain pH above 7.3-7.35 so as to
   maintain environment in which pressors are active
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, check INR today; last INR was 1.4
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   -holding dopamine with resolution of afib
   .
   #Skin sloughing: f/u wound care recs

   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 4)- holding
   vanco dose as supratherapeutic today
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   - acidosis is largely secondary to metabolic acidosis from renal
   failure/lactic acidosis; administered bicarbonate yesterday (is on
   bicarb at home)
   -sputum cx showed gram positive cocci; pt also positive for MRSA.
   Covering with vanc/zosyn/cipro; loculated pleural effusion on CXR; no
   thoracentesis at this time- will await change with diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock.  Elevated lactate (1.2 to 7 yesterday). Possibly due
   to period of hypoperfusion when hypotensive yesterday AM.
   -CE added onto labs from  yesterday AM and were still trending down.
   -Possible gut ischemia leading to elevated lactate, secondary to
   levophed use?
   - Would consider CT chest/abd
   - still on vasopressin; levophed and dopamine weaned off
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only minimally; will rely mostly on
   pressors
   -trend ABG's Q3 hour
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 3.4.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed but
   may also have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  ddx
   includes prerenal [**1-6**] volume down vs sepsis, also ATN. Pt does appear
   to also have a component of CRI
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -not a good HD candidate
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Hct stable at 30. EGD with no active source of bleeding.
   - not actively bleeding, does have guaiac pos stool
   - maintain active type and screen
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   #Elevated LFT's- likely [**1-6**] ischemia
   - will trend for resolution and maintain MAPs>65
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG is 17 this AM, with downward trending lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   - sodium bicarb administration to maintain pH above 7.3-7.35 so as to
   maintain environment in which pressors are active
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, check INR today; last INR was 1.4
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   -holding dopamine with resolution of afib
   .
   #Skin sloughing: f/u wound care recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and recent bloody/brown secretions from the mouth, suggesting a possible pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration event. She is on mechanical ventilation with a protected airway.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressors for blood pressure support. There is a concern for septic shock or cardiogenic shock.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is oliguric (low urine output). She may have prerenal volume depletion or sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 10 and active gastrointestinal bleeding. She"

   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.  Sputum culture positive for
   MRSA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently intubated, on pressors, and has been transferred from another hospital. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia treated with ertapenem and sputum culture positive for MRSA. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, oliguric acute renal failure, and elevated INR. She has been diagnosed with multiple comorbidities including CAD, elevated troponin levels suggestive of NSTEMI/demand ischemia, elevated liver enzymes likely due to ischemia, and elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration of bloody gastric materials, pulmonary hemorrhage, or underlying event such as hypotension. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to sepsis and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction requires aggressive management of infection sources and supportive care. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multiple organ"

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was intubated and placed on pressors. EGD showed reflux esophagitis. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. There is a possibility of aspiration again or worsening respiratory distress.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive likely due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. There is a risk of further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased significantly, indicating acute renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function and potential need for dialysis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high INR and is at risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation status and careful management of blood products are essential.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of diverticulosis"

   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 5)

   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -CE trending down.
   -Liver enzymes trending down
   - No evidence of gut ischemia on CT abd/pelvis
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only minimally; will rely mostly on
   pressors
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 3.6. Likely [**1-6**] ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI.

   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with altered mental status, unresponsiveness, and bradycardia. She has been intubated and is on pressors. She has a known history of diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids and presented with blood around her mouth, INR of 10, and bradycardia. She received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with ongoing hypotension. Her hemoglobin concentration decreased by three points from the previous day. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis but no active source of bleeding. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity. She has also had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be secondary to sepsis,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with altered mental status, unresponsiveness, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient was found to have active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 10, and a recent history of aspiration pneumonia (APN) treated with ertapenem. She was intubated, on mechanical ventilation, and required low-dose pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration of bloody gastric materials or pulmonary hemorrhage. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires low-dose pressors.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate levels indicate lactic acidosis, but it is now resolving.
3. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level in the range of 1.2-1.5, currently at 3.6, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). There is a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) as well.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a history of diverticulosis and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 10, and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was intubated and on pressors, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis. The patient also had an NSTEMI and was recently admitted with aspiration pneumonia treated with ertapenem.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been found down bradycardic and hypotensive, which could be due to hypotension, aspiration of bloody gastric materials, or pulmonary hemorrhage. It is unclear whether the underlying event was hypotension or aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate levels indicate possible tissue hypoperfusion, but they are now resolving.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was in the range of 1.2-1.5, but it has increased to 3.6. This suggests acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She now has unresolving acute renal failure and respiratory failure.

The patient is currently receiving continuous antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). She is also on vasopressin for hypotension and to improve urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 361 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 383, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 153.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 63 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 152/82 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of"

   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is now experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, and elevated liver enzymes. She has a history of diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia and has a positive sputum culture for MRSA. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to aspiration of bloody gastric materials, pulmonary hemorrhage, or underlying cardiogenic shock. It is important to closely monitor her oxygenation and ventilatory status.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors are necessary.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Monitoring urine output, serum"

   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 5)
   -?replace groin line
   -will try to get PICC today, groin line still in.
   - held vanc yesterday, and will hold again today for elevated trough
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   -tolerating psv, stable ABG
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -remains on vassopressin
   -CE trending down.
   -Liver enzymes trending down
   - No evidence of gut ischemia on CT abd/pelvis
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only minimally; will rely mostly on
   pressors
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.0. Likely [**1-6**] ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI.
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable; continues to be positive each day with anasarca
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -renal following
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after [**Doctor First Name 8366**] found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Hct 24 (three point drop from yesterday). EGD with no active source of
   bleeding.
   - not actively bleeding, does have guaiac pos stool
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will not transfuse now in the setting of volume overload. Would
   maintain transfusion threshold of Hct <21
   .
   #? Cdiff
   On flagyl for empiric cdiff coverage as pt apparently had cdiff at
   [**Hospital1 **] and had rising wbc. Cdiff toxin neg x2 here.
   -will dc empiric flagyl
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   #Elevated LFT's- likely [**1-6**] ischemia
   - will trend for resolution and maintain MAPs>65
   .
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG is 17 this AM, with downward trending lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   - sodium bicarb administration to maintain pH above 7.3-7.35 so as to
   maintain environment in which pressors are active
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, check INR today; last INR was 1.4
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   .
   #Skin sloughing: f/u wound care recs
   .
   # Edema: Anasarca of likely due to poor nutrition status but also
   losing protein in urine.
   - on tube feeds; nutrition following
    -consider ACEi if possible
   -limit boluses

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated with the need for low-dose pressors. Endoscopy showed reflux esophagitis, as well as evidence of an NSTEMI. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation and requires low-dose pressors.

Over the past 24 hours, there have been several notable events. The patient again attempted to wean off vasopressin unsuccessfully. A family meeting was held without much progress, although they were informed that the patient will likely not be discharged from the ICU. The patient's endotracheal tube was pulled back to 3 cm above the carina, and she was successfully weaned to a lower level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and positive airway pressure (PSV) mode on the ventilator. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) remained stable.

The patient also had a dirty urine analysis and did not have her femoral line removed due to an inability to place a percutaneous central catheter (PICC). A consultation with palliative care has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), Alzheimer's disease, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in [**5-12**]. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, and an endotracheal (ET) tube was inserted. She also required low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with positive sputum culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She has hypotension likely secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock, elevated lactate levels, and acute renal failure (ARF) with an elevated creatinine level of 3.6. She also has a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient's elevated INR is a result of her on coumadin for AFib, and she has active upper/lower GI bleeds with guaiac-positive stool. There is no evidence of gut ischemia on computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis.

The patient has other conditions such as possible Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, elevated tro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 63-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-113/50-53 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, pantoprazole (Protonix), fentanyl, and NovaSource renal nutrition. The patient has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory results suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, characterized by a decrease in kidney function."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), Alzheimer's disease, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the past 5-12 months. The patient was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration of bloody gastric materials or pulmonary hemorrhage. There is evidence of bloody/brown secretions from the mouth and frank blood being suctioned from the endotracheal tube. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia treated with ertapenem.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate levels indicate tissue hypoperfusion, but they are now resolving. The patient remains on vasopressin, and diuresis is being increased.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine in the range of 1.2-1.5, now elevated to 4.0. This may be due to [**1-6**] acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Renal dosing of medications is necessary.

4. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient has a history of diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids and presented with blood around her mouth, an INR of 10, and bloody brown secretions. She received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and is no longer actively bleeding. EGD showed no active source of bleeding, but guaiac-positive stool is present.

5. Possible C. difficile: The patient had rising white blood cell counts and was treated empirically for C. difficile infection with flagyl. However, the C. difficile toxin test is negative.

6. CAD/Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated due to strain from hypotension, bradycardia, and GI bleed. EKGs appear at baseline, indicating an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia.

7. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, likely due to ischemia.

8. Elevated Anion Gap: The patient has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to acute renal failure and lactic acidosis.

9. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib with active GI bleed and elevated INR. Coumadin"

The patient also had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was vented, requiring low-dose pressors.

24-hour events:
- The patient attempted to wean vasopressin unsuccessfully.
- No change in goals of care after family meeting, though it was discussed that she likely will not leave the ICU.
- The endotracheal tube was pulled back to 3 cm above the carina.
- The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted to PEEP: 5 cm H2O, FiO2: 40%, and PS: 16 cm H2O, with stable ABG results.
- A dirty urine analysis (UA) was obtained.
- The femoral line was not discontinued yesterday because a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) could not be placed until today.
- A consultation with palliative care was scheduled.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10, indicating a bleeding tendency. She has an active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleed, unresolving acute renal failure, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is not tolerating decreases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and her respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is in the 140s. She has MRSA in her sputum, and she is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on a small dose of vasopressin, indicating hypotension.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure/Anasarca: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels continue to rise. Diuretics will be tried, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be considered based on overall goals of care.
4. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient is receiving NovaSource Renal (Full) through a feeding tube at 35 mL/hour.

   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.

   -lasix 80 given yesterday, then 120 later in the day.  No significant
   response
 20 to 30 ml per hour UOP.
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -remains on vasopressin, increased to 1.2 since yesterday.
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), Alzheimer's disease, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital intubated and on vasopressors.

The patient's current health progress can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She has been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support device. Her SpO2 remains at 100%, but her ABG results indicate hypoxemia (///20/). She also has an elevated respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 96.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. Her blood pressure has been consistently below the normal range (105/41 mmHg). She is currently on vasopressin at a dose of 1.2 units/hour. Fluid boluses have been avoided due to massive fluid overload and lack of response to previous fluid administration.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction, type II diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleed, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and is now being treated for these conditions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a risk of septic shock and further deterioration in organ function if not properly managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to AKI if not treated promptly. This may require dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management is necessary.
4. Hypothermia: The patient has hypothermia, which can lead to various complications such as arrhythmias and organ dysfunction. Active warming measures should be implemented.
5. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may indicate inadequate perfusion and end-organ damage. Continuous monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are required.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has upper gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is now experiencing unresolving acute renal failure and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by the low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) in the 90s. Tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV), but there is a plan to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today to assess further improvement.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on vasopressin, which suggests ongoing hypotension. There is a plan to wean off vasopressin if the patient's condition stabilizes.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure/Anasarca: The patient's urine output has only slightly improved with the administration of lasix. The presence of anasarca (generalized edema) indicates potential fluid overload.
4. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient had a significant GI bleed, resulting in blood loss anemia. A unit of blood was transfused, and there may be ongoing blood loss from the PICC"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was intubated and on pressors, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis. She also had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is still vented and requiring low-dose pressors.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate in the setting of hypotension is now resolving.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine in the range of 1.2-1.5, currently at 4.2. It is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Monitoring urine output (UOP) is crucial, and the patient requires close renal follow-up.
4. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed with an elevated INR of 10"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Decided on am rounds to give vanco 500 mg if trough level below 20,
   otherwise hold.  However, vanco trough returned at 21.6 (last dose
   given 5 days ago - [**2172-8-8**]).
   -PEG tube clogged yesterday evening and overnight, written for Viokase
   on morning rounds.  Successfully unclogged at 2 pm, tube feeds were
   restarted.
   -Pressure support reduced from 14 to 12.
   -Vasopressin taken off in the morning, but presure dropped again, so it
   was restarted to 1.2
   -Palliative care consult ordered, discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**] -
   recommended specifically defining outcome goals with family before
   discussing other details of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on vasopressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis and evidence of recent bleeding. The patient also had an non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found down with bloody/brown secretions coming from her mouth and frank blood being suctioned from the endotracheal tube (ETT). Her respiratory status is likely secondary to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She has positive sputum culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She has been on empirical vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for hospital-acquired organisms. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction
3. Type II diabetes mellitus
4. Acute renal failure
5. Coagulopathy
6. Hypothermia

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10, active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding, unresolving acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and vasopressin infusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests a potential for ongoing respiratory failure. The presence of volume overload further complicates extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's inability to wean off vasopressin indicates persistent hypotension, which may require continued administration of vasopressors.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure/Anasarca: The patient's renal function has not improved significantly, suggesting ongoing acute renal failure. The presence of anasarca (generalized edema) may indicate an underlying systemic condition contributing to the renal failure.
4. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit level suggests ongoing blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to further complications such as hypoxia or shock.
5. Infection: The increased white blood cell count indicates a potential infection. Culturing should be done to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy."

   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day [**7-17**])
   - vanc level today is <20 so will give 500 of vanc
   - plan for fam mtg re trach
   -tolerating psv, stable ABG
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -remains on vasopressin, increased in order to try to improve perfusion
   to kidneys.
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured yesterday, will f/u
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.2. Likely [**1-6**] ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was intubated, placed on pressors, and transferred to the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status (not delirium), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, type II diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension (not shock), gastrointestinal bleed (melena), and respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/40 mmHg to 136/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Microbiology cultures are pending.

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, continuous renal replacement therapy, aggressive fluid management, and close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and blood"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She also has sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory status may worsen if there is continued fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis with organ dysfunction needs to be closely monitored and managed aggressively to prevent further deterioration.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if there is no improvement in urine output and creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia needs to be addressed promptly to prevent complications such as arrhythmias and organ dysfunction.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10, and active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleed. The patient now presents with unresolving acute renal failure and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and there are indications of massive volume overload, worsening metabolic acidosis, and poor mental status. These factors make extubation not possible at the moment.

2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which is currently being managed by being off vasopressin. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it may lead to further complications.

3. Oliguric acute renal failure/anasarca: The patient's renal function has not improved overall, and there is evidence of fluid retention (anasarca). This indicates a potential worsening of acute renal failure.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, and free water repletion is being considered. If not managed appropriately, hyponatremia can lead to neurological complications.

5. GI bleed/blood loss anemia: Although the patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, ongoing blood loss"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis, as well as [Last Name (un)] and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient remains ventilated and requires low-dose pressors.

The patient's 24-hour events include another family meeting with no change in plans, receiving another dose of vancomycin, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.3, PaCO2 41, and PaO2 152. There are no recommendations for renal or palliative care. The patient's potassium level was corrected with the administration of potassium chloride.

The patient's allergies include thiazides and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin on [Date] at 12:00 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 08:22 PM.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 104/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.4 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 24.8%, platelet count of 121 thousand/mm³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.4 mg/dL, sodium of 147 mEq/L, potassium of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride of 113 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.  Also
   with worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing
   fluid overload.  Not a candidate for CVVH.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day [**8-17**])
   - vanco level yesterday <20, so she did receive 500 mg dose.  Trough
   today pending.
   - family meeting yesterday, with no change to current plans.
   -tolerating psv, stable ABG
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -remains on vasopressin, increased in order to try to improve perfusion
   to kidneys.
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured on [**8-14**], will f/u
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.4 and continuing to climb. Likely [**1-6**] ATN.
   Pt does appear to also have a component of CRI.
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable; continues to be fluid positive each day with
   anasarca
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -renal following from a distance
 pt not an ideal candidate for HD or
   CVVH per renal
   -tried lasix 100IV and albumin twice to this point without significant
   effect on  UOP.

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   -HCT 22.7 today, from 24.8 yesterday.  Will transfuse if this drops
   below 21 again.
   -coags stable, but substantial uremia likely causing coagulopathy.
   - maintain active type and screen  (expires [**8-16**])

   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.  Also
   with worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing
   fluid overload.  Not a candidate for CVVH.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day [**8-17**])
   - vanco level yesterday <20, so she did receive 500 mg dose.  Trough

 hold vanco today.
   - family meeting yesterday, with no change to current plans.
   - tolerating psv, stable ABG
s on [**7-8**].
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -remains on vasopressin, have tried repeatedly to DC this, but she
   remains hypotensive.
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured on [**8-14**], will f/u

   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.4 and continuing to climb. Likely [**1-6**] ATN.
   Pt does appear to also have a component of CRI.
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable; continues to be fluid positive each day with
   anasarca
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -renal following from a distance
 pt not an ideal candidate for HD or
   CVVH per renal
   -tried lasix 100IV and albumin twice to this point without significant
   effect on  UOP.

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   -HCT 22.7 today, from 24.8 yesterday.  Will transfuse if this drops
   below 21 again.
   -coags stable, but substantial uremia likely causing coagulopathy.
   - maintain active type and screen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She is currently experiencing unresolving acute renal failure and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing volume overload and effusions, worsening metabolic acidosis, and poor mental status, which make extubation unfavorable.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to need vasopressin due to ongoing hypotension.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure/Anasarca: The patient's renal function is not improving overall but not worsening today.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient requires free H2O repletion.
5. GI bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient should be transfused for Hct < 21.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to critical illness.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important for the healthcare team to regularly reassess and update the patient's condition to provide appropriate care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10, active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure.

The patient has been intubated for over two weeks and is experiencing ongoing volume overload and effusions. She also has worsening metabolic acidosis and poor mental status. The plan is to continue discussing extubation with the family.

The patient requires vasopressin for hypotension and transfusion for blood loss anemia when her hematocrit level falls below 21. Her renal function has not improved overall but is not worsening either.

Other issues include hyponatremia, which will be managed through free water repletion, and the remainder of her concerns will be addressed by the ICU team.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has not improved and she is experiencing ongoing oliguria. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical despite being on mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and further respiratory complications.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has active upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in significant blood loss and anemia"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, intubated, and on pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. She remains on vasopressin and has been unable to wean off. There is a need to monitor SvO2 to determine if it is septic or cardiogenic shock.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for 13 days and has massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She has an MRSA sputum culture, and empirical Vanc/Zosyn has been started. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has stable ABGs.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.5 and currently has a creatinine of 4.5, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a component of chronic renal"

   versus cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.
   -SvO2 c/w septic shock
   -remains on vasopressin, have tried repeatedly to DC this, but she
   remains hypotensive. Will try starting midodrine as this may help wean.
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured on [**8-14**], so far sputum c MRSA, otherwise NGTD
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna. On Day 13 of intubation.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [**8-14**].
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day [**9-16**]). Zosyn

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   - Will transfuse if this drops below 21 again.
   -coags stable, but substantial uremia likely causing coagulopathy.
   - maintain active type and screen (current one expires [**8-20**], next one
   already ordered)
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - pt appears to have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB due to GI bleed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on coumadin. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. The patient is intubated and on pressors, and also has worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing fluid overload, and other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/shock: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus cardiogenic shock. Elevated lactate in the setting of hypotension, now resolving. The patient remains on vasopressin and has tried repeatedly to discontinue this but remains hypotensive. Will try starting midodrine as this may help wean.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for 13 days and has massive volume overload and pulmonary edema, along with pneumonia. Sputum culture positive for MRSA. Empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hospital organisms, Asp PNA (day 9-16). Zosyn discontinued today. Will keep vancomycin to treat hospital-acquired PNA. Hold dose again this AM for trough >20. Tolerating pressure support, stable ABG on 7-8 (metabolic acidosis likely due to uremia). SBP this AM c stable gas, however, RR rose to >30. Likely large barrier to extubation is fluid overload; renal willing to consider short-term CVVH but does NOT recommend.

3. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine in the 1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.5 and continuing to climb. Likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient appears to also have a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up, electrolytes stable; continues to be fluid positive each day with anasarca. Renally dose all meds. Renal us unremarkable. Reconsulted renal regarding possible CVVH as above- they do not recommend, but would consider it.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are worsening. Will increase free water in tube feeds.

5. GI bleed/elevated INR: The patient has known diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4 units fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with ongoing hypotension. No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward. Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased production in setting of metabolic stress. Will"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently intubated and on low-dose pressors. She has worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, and increasing fluid overload. The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis. Her respiratory status is likely due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She has oliguric acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level and fluid retention. She also has hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated INR, coronary artery disease with elevated troponin levels, atrial fibrillation, and skin sloughing/sacral ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive and likely has an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and low urine output.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or excessive intake of sodium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital intubated and on vasopressors, EGD showing reflux esophagitis, and NSTEMI. She remains vented and requires low-dose vasopressors. She also has worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing fluid overload, and is hypothermic.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension/shock, respiratory failure, oliguric acute renal failure, hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleed/elevated INR, and elevated troponin due to possible NSTEMI/Demand ischemia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/ shock: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis in light of SvO2. Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now resolving. Still hypothermic. She remains on vasopressin and has been unable to wean off despite the addition of midodrine. Can attempt to wean further after CVVH today.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on day 15 of intubation. Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [**8-14**]. On Vanc for MRSA pneumonia (day [**10-17**]). Zosyn was stopped yesterday. She is hypothermic and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with stable ABG.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine in the 1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.8 and continuing to climb. Likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She appears to also have a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). CVVH will be initiated today.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 146, and she will continue with free water in tube feeds.
5. GI Bleed/Elevated INR: The patient has known diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. She presented after being found down with blood around her mouth, INR of 10, and bradycardia. No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward. Possible due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased production in setting of metabolic stress. She received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and is still hypotensive. Coags stable, but substantial uremia likely causing coagulopathy.

   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.  Also
   with worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing
   fluid overload.
   # Hypotension/ shock: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis in
   light of SvO2.  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -off pressors for most of yesterday, back on for several hours
   overnight and on for HD
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured on [**8-14**], so far sputum c MRSA, otherwise NGTD
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna. On Day 15 of intubation.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [**8-14**].
   - On Vanc for MRSA pneumonia (day [**11-16**]). Zosyn d/ced
   - will redose vancomycin after HD
   - tolerating psv, stable ABG

   -likely large barrier to extubation is fluid overload;  for HD today;
   if tolerates HD, will try extubation after some fluid removal. If she
   does not tolerate, would get trach. If hemodialysis does not improve
   status, will discuss comfort care with family
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**1-6**] ATN.  Pt with baseline
   creatinine in the 1.2-1.5 range. Pt does appear to also have a
   component of CRI.
   - starting hemodialysis today
   - dose all meds for HD

   #hypernatremia: Sodium of 146. will increase free water in tube feeds

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   - Will transfuse if this drops below 21 again.

   - maintain active type and screen (current one expires [**8-22**]))
   -may want to restart coumadin after trach

   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.

   - holding BB due to GI bleed

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been on pressors, and her current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, type II diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and upper GI bleed. She has impaired skin integrity, fluid overload, and is on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is hypotensive likely due to sepsis. She has been on pressors intermittently.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a positive sputum culture for MRSA and is on vancomycin.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient"

   with worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing
   fluid overload.
   # Hypotension/ shock: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis in
   light of SvO2.  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -off pressors for most of yesterday, now back on since 1am, will try to
   wean
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload and previous lack of
   response to fluids.
   -recultured on [**8-14**], so far sputum c MRSA, otherwise NGTD
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna. On Day 15 of intubation.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [**8-14**].
   - On Vanc for MRSA pneumonia (day [**10-17**]). Zosyn d/ced
   - hold dose again this AM for trough >20
   - tolerating psv, stable ABG
s on [**7-8**] (metabolic acidosis likely [**1-6**]
   uremia).
   -likely large barrier to extubation is fluid overload; for CVVH today;
   if tolerates CVVH and can transition to HD, will get trach. If CVVH
   does not improve status, will discuss comfort care with family
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 4.8 and continuing to climb. Likely [**1-6**] ATN.
   Pt does appear to also have a component of CRI.
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable; continues to be fluid positive each day with
   anasarca
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   - CVVH today as above
   .
   #hypernatremia: Sodium of 146. will increase free water in tube feeds
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   - Will transfuse if this drops below 21 again.
   -coags stable, but substantial uremia likely causing coagulopathy.
   - maintain active type and screen (current one expires [**8-20**], next one
   already ordered)
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - pt appears to have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB due to GI bleed
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, following coags
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   #Skin sloughing/sacral ulcers: f/u wound care recs
   .
   # Edema: Anasarca likely due to poor nutrition status and fluid
   overload
   - on tube feeds.
   -limit boluses
   -Lasix has been tried several times without significant effect on UOP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving low-dose pressors, and has been intubated for 15 days.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension/shock, respiratory failure, oliguric acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia, altered mental status (not delirium), sepsis with organ dysfunction, diabetes mellitus type II, and impaired skin integrity.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis. Pressors have been restarted after being off for most of the previous day. Fluid boluses are avoided due to massive fluid overload and previous lack of response.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely secondary to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She has been intubated for 15 days and has a sputum culture positive for MRSA. Vanc has been"

   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2437**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also
   [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI, still vented and requiring low dose pressors.  Also
   with worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, increasing
   fluid overload.
    .
   # Hypotension/ shock: Seems to be improving
   - Pt on and off of low dose pressors
   -avoid fluid boluses, given massive fluid overload
   -recultured on [**8-14**], so far sputum c MRSA, otherwise NGTD
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT.   Current
   respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and
   pulmonary edema plus pna. On Day 15 of intubation.
   - Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [**8-14**].
   - On Vanc for MRSA pneumonia (day 13/14). Zosyn d/ced
   - will redose vancomycin after HD
   - tolerating psv, stable ABG
s on [**7-8**] (metabolic acidosis likely [**1-6**]
   uremia).
   -likely large barrier to extubation is fluid overload;  for HD today;
   if tolerates HD, will try extubation after some fluid removal. If she
   does not tolerate, would get trach. If hemodialysis does not improve
   status, will discuss comfort care with family
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**1-6**] ATN.  Pt with baseline
   creatinine in the 1.2-1.5 range. Pt does appear to also have a
   component of CRI.
   - on HD since yesterday
   - dose all meds for HD
   -consider tunneled line
   .
   #hypernatremia: Sodium of 148
   -increase tube feed free water boluses to 250 q4h
   - could consider giving a small bolus of free water IV.
   -will recheck electrolytes this afternoon
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   No clear source of bleeding, but HCT continues to drift downward.
   Possibly due to small amounts of occult blood loss, decreased
   production in setting of metabolic stress.
   - Will transfuse if this drops below 21 again.
   -coags stable
   - maintain active type and screen (current one expires [**8-22**]))
   -may want to restart coumadin after trach
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - pt appears to have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB due to GI bleed
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, following coags
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   #Skin sloughing/sacral ulcers: f/u wound care recs, acyclovir cream to
   punched out lesions on bottom

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was intubated and on pressors upon transfer from another hospital. She also had reflux esophagitis, NSTEMI, and worsening urine renal failure with very low urine output and increasing fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient was on and off low-dose pressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. However, it seems to be improving.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for 15 days and has developed MRSA pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin for the pneumonia and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with stable ABG.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a baseline creatinine in the range of 1.2-1.5. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) since yesterday and will continue if she tolerates it. If not, a tracheostomy may be considered.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148. Measures have been taken to increase tube"

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis in light of SvO2. Elevated lactate in the setting of hypotension, now resolving. The patient was off pressors for most of yesterday but was put back on for several hours overnight and on for hemodialysis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient found down, bradycardic, and hypotensive. Unclear if the underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from the mouth and some frank blood being suctioned from the ETT. Current respiratory status likely secondary to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema plus pneumonia. On Day 15 of intubation. Sputum culture positive for MRSA; still positive on [8-14]. On Vanc for MRSA pneumonia (day [11-16]). Zos"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a previous stroke. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10, indicating a high risk of bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been on low-dose pressors and has worsening urine renal failure with very low urine output. Her current respiratory status is likely due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema, along with an underlying pneumonia. She is on day 16 of intubation and is tolerating CPAP with PSV at 8/5. Her last ABG showed a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 38, HCO3 of 136, and BE of -1. She is also experiencing oliguric acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She has been on hemodialysis (HD) since August 20th and requires ongoing fluid removal to improve respiratory status. There is a potential trial of extubation versus tracheostomy. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, which has resolved with free water boluses through tube feeds. Her sodium level is now at 139, and she will continue to receive free water boluses through tube feeds as needed. Additionally, she has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with no"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, and a previous stroke. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10, indicating a significant bleeding risk. She has been intubated and requires low-dose pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, oliguric acute renal failure, hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has been on and off low-dose pressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on day 16 of intubation, suggesting severe respiratory compromise. This may be due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema, along with underlying pneumonia.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with baseline creatinine in the range of 1.2-1.5. She is on hemodialysis (HD) since August 20th, indicating severe renal dysfunction.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level that has resolved with free water boluses through tube feeds. It is crucial to continue monitoring and providing free water boluses as needed.

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. The patient was intubated and on pressors, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an INR of 10 and active upper/lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. He was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. EGD showed reflux esophagitis, and the patient also had non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently vented and requiring low-dose pressors. He has worsening urine renal failure, very low urine output, and increasing fluid overload.

1. Hypotension/Shock: Improving mental status now on hemodialysis (HD).
- Patient on and off low-dose pressors PRN based on HD.
- Will increase midodrine to 15mg TID if needed.
- Currently no central access and will need to go to interventional radiology (IR) to have peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line revised.
- Stopped fentanyl patch yesterday.
- Continue to follow cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was found unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10, and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient was transferred from another hospital and intubated due to respiratory failure. She is currently on low-dose pressors and requires low-dose pressors per hour. Her mental status has improved with hemodialysis (HD), but she still has worsening urine renal failure with very low urine output and increasing fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient's hypotension is improving with HD, but she still requires low-dose pressors PRN. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on day 16 of intubation and has a current respiratory status likely due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. She tolerates CPAP with PSV at 8/5 but remains lethargic. Extubation attempts should be made carefully, and if unsuccessful, a tracheostomy may be considered.
3. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a baseline creatinine in the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and Alzheimer's disease. She presented unresponsive and bradycardic with an elevated INR of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She was intubated and placed on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed reflux esophagitis. She has since been extubated and is now on hemodialysis (HD) with improving mental status. She continues to require low-dose pressors and has worsening urine renal failure with increasing fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is still requiring low-dose pressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely compromised due to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a component of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Regular monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
4. Hypernatremia: Although the sodium levels have improved, close attention should be given to electrolyte imbalances and hydration status.
5. GI Ble"

   -vancomycin d/c'ed
   -restarted vasopressin b/c still w/ occasional hypotension
   -PICC line no longer central. will have to go to IR tomorrow to have it
   repositioned
   -nursing is extremely concerned about herpetic lesions over sacrum.
   everytime they put acyclovir cream over lesions, they bleed, and the
   cream does not stay on the wound b/c they are weeping. the wounds have
   gotten bigger. as per pharmacy, should be applied Q3 hours. Have
   changed to Q8 hours for tonight because does not appear to even be
   working per nursing's report. OK'ed this by pharmacy. we are not
   starting IV acyclovir because >72 hours since wounds appeared, so not
   efficacious. informed nursing that we will discuss this issue with
   wound care nurse tomorrow (not in on the weekend).
   -renal wants her to go for dialysis again Monday or Tues
   -checking surveillance cultures to make sure OK for tunnelled line

   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   hct has trended up recently, today at 25
   - consider PRBC transfusion at 21
   - coags stable
   - maintain active type and screen (current one expires today))
   - may need long term anticoagulation for afib if stable and decision to
   trach or not trach has been made.
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed
 demand
   ischemia
   - continue to hold ASA and Coumadin due to initial presentation with GI
   bleed
   - holding BB due to hypotension
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - coumadin being held b/c of potential for trach tomorrow or tunneled
   line in long term
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive
   #Skin sloughing/sacral ulcers: f/u wound care recs, acyclovir cream to
   punched out lesions on bottom; will need to discuss with wound care
   nurse as nursing expresses that cream easily rubs off and not very
   efficacious. IV acyclovir not an option b/c >72 hours since onset
   # Edema: Anasarca likely due to poor nutrition status and fluid
   overload
   -on HD and improving
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds
   - check electrolytes daily and replete PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), Alzheimer's disease, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the past 5-12 months. She was found unresponsive and bradycardic, with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 10 and active upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. The patient was transferred from another hospital, intubated, and on pressors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed esophagitis.

The patient has had several medical complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, coagulopathy, hypothermia, hypotension, GI bleed, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. She has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and was recently extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension has been improving with the use of low-dose pressors. However, close monitoring is necessary to prevent further episodes of hypotension or shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely related to massive volume overload and pulmonary edema, exacerbated by her body habitus. She has been extubated but requires ongoing respiratory support.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute"
