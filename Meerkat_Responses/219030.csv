 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
   Assessment difficult because of patient's history of manipulating the
   system, but he appears to be genuinely tremulous and tachycardic now.
   Would give additional benzodiazepines and fluids. Would check
   magnesium; patient has come in hypomagnesemic in the past.
   Oxygenation excellent. Continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of manipulating the system and is currently refusing IVs and blood draws intermittently. They have persistent knee pain and an altered mental status due to encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia when awakened, but are within normal range during sleep. They are experiencing mild tremors and have a history of hypomagnesemia. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight with thin build, anxious and diaphoretic appearance. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and amylase/lipase levels. The patient is currently receiving valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and has orders for additional benzodiazepines and fluids. They are also receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for several medical complications:

1. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.

2. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, including confusion, hallucinations, and fever. It requires immediate medical attention.

3. Infections: Due to the patient's refusal of IVs and blood draws, there is a risk of developing infections, such as catheter-related"

He has been admitted multiple times for detox and has a history of DTs/withdrawal seizures. The patient is currently experiencing anxiety, tremulousness, and tachycardia, for which he received 120mg of Valium overnight. The plan is to continue administering Valium 10mg PO q2h prn CIWA > 10, load with benzodiazepines until signs of mild intoxication, and then maintain with lower doses. Thiamine, folate, and multivitamin supplementation will be provided. Social work consult and telemetry monitoring will also be implemented.

The patient likely sustained a fall while intoxicated, resulting in knee pain. An X-ray has been performed to rule out any fractures. Tylenol can be given for pain relief, with a maximum daily dosage of 2g.

The patient has a history of Hepatitis C virus infection, with relatively severe transaminitis in the past. Current diffuse abdominal pain is being monitored, along with liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient has chronically elevated lipase levels, indicative of chronic pancreatitis likely due to long-term alcohol use. Lipase levels will continue to be monitored.

Depression and anxiety are also present, for which Valium will be continued as mentioned earlier. A social work consult will be conducted.

1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and previous admissions for withdrawal seizures, there is a potential risk for seizures during the detoxification process.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient has a history of HCV and chronic pancreatitis, which may contribute to liver dysfunction. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is recommended.
3. Chronic pancreatitis: The patient has chronically elevated lipase levels, indicating a potential complication of chronic pancreatitis due to long-term alcohol use. Continued monitoring of lipase levels is advised.
4. Depression/anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, and Valium is being used to manage these symptoms. It is important"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and multiple admissions for detox and withdrawal seizures. He presents with intoxication followed by withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 122/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and has received 120mg of valium overnight for anxiety, tremulousness, and tachycardia. The plan includes increasing CIWA to q2hr, providing valium 10mg PO q4h prn CIWA > 10, loading with benzodiazepines until signs of mild intoxication, administering thiamine, folate, multivitamin, and arranging social work consult for detox and rehab. Telemetry monitoring is also ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures: The patient has a history of withdrawal seizures, which can occur during alcohol withdrawal. Continuous monitoring and administration of benzodiazepines are essential to prevent seizures.
2. Delirium Tremens (DTs): DTs is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by hallucinations, fever, and autonomic instability. Close monitoring for the development of DTs symptoms is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and multiple admissions for detox and withdrawal seizures. He presents with intoxication followed by withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been improving, showing reducing tremulousness without hallucinations or tactile variations. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 122/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, heparin for prophylaxis, and other medications including famotidine, valium, and thiamine. Social work has been notified for planning discharge to a dual diagnosis program when the patient is stable. The patient denies hallucinations and appears wide-eyed and scared. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and previous admissions for withdrawal seizures, there is a risk of experiencing seizures during the withdrawal process.
2. Liver damage: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage, which may manifest as transaminitis or elevated liver enzymes. The patient's history of HCV and elevated AST and ALT levels indicate a need for close monitoring of liver function.
3. Chronic pancreatitis: The patient's chronically elevated lipase levels suggest the possibility of chronic pancreatitis, which is often associated with long-term alcohol abuse.
