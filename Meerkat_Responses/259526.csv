","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the right coronary artery (RCA) distribution. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the RCA and found to have 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was not intervened upon.

The patient is currently in the cardiac care unit (CCU) and is on multiple medications including atorvastatin, aspirin, and Plavix. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 101/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The physical examination reveals a pulse in the midclavicular line at the fifth intercostal space, no murmurs or gallops, clear lungs with anterior lateral crackles, and no femoral bruits. The patient has multiple tattoos on his arms and chest.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 33.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 241 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/d"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the right coronary artery (RCA) distribution. 

The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal RCA and found to have 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was not intervened upon. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 101/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination revealed no jugular venous distention (JVD), a regular heart rhythm with a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located at the 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line, clear lungs with anterior lateral crackles, and no femoral bruits. 

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels in the 400s, slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and decreased platelet count (Plt). Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Cardiac biomarkers such as troponin-T and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) are elevated, indicating myocardial injury.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the right coronary artery (RCA) distribution. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal RCA and found to have 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was not intervened upon.

The patient's current medications include Atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin 325mg daily, and Plavix 75mg daily. The patient is also receiving intravenous fluids, insulin gtt for glycemic control, and heparin gtt for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation. On the current day, the patient's dopamine infusion was weaned from 5 to 4 mcg/kg/min. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction of 40%, indicating reduced cardiac function. The TTE also revealed a dilated and hypocontractile right ventricle, consistent with a right ventricular infarction. Additionally, there was moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a dilated aorta. The patient's HgbA1c level was 6.2%, indicating relatively well-controlled diabetes. His cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were within normal limits.

The patient is receiving insulin through a continuous infusion to maintain blood sugar levels between 120-150 mg/dL. He is also on dopamine at 4 mcg/kg/min, heparin sodium at 1,600 units/hour, and regular insulin at 1 unit/hour. The patient has been given compazine and intravenous fluids (IVF) for nausea and emesis. He experienced two episodes of pleuritic chest pain, which improved with morphine administration, and EKG changes"

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chest pain, shortness of breath, and recent hospitalization for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient has several significant medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. He is currently on insulin to control his blood sugar levels.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been relatively stable. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/68 mmHg to 108/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's medication regimen includes dopamine, insulin, heparin, lorazepam, and morphine. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Physical examination reveals a patient who is anxious, oriented, and alert. His lungs sound clear, and his abdomen is soft without any tenderness. The patient's extremities are cool, but there is good movement with capillary refill. Multiple tattoos are present on his arms and chest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the right coronary artery distribution. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the proximal RCA and found to have 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, which was not intervened upon. The patient completed Integrillin therapy and is currently on aspirin, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel.

The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of nausea and emesis, for which he received Compazine and IV fluids. His blood sugar levels have been fluctuating but remain within the target range of 120-150 mg/dL. His HgbA1c level is 6.2%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 96/68 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 bpm. He is on dopamine infusion at a rate of 4 mcg/kg/min and has an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in place.

The patient's echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40%, dilated and hypocontractile right ventricle, consistent with right ventricular infarction. There is also moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a dilated aorta. The"

   of furosemide in light of his positive fluid balance. He did not
   increase UOP and the tachypnea persisted, even despite Ativan doses.
   ABG on [**1-10**] shows CO of 19. This may be compensatory for a metabolic
   acidosis (Anion Gap 19 on [**1-10**]).

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a STEMI in the right coronary artery distribution. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including dopamine, heparin, furosemide, and insulin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. His physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, cool extremities, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, elevated Cr, and lactic acidosis. The patient's ejection fraction is 40% with evidence of right ventricular infarction and moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): The patient's cool extremities and diminished pulses suggest poor peripheral circulation, which may indicate PAD. This can lead to decreased blood flow to the limbs and potential tissue damage.

2. Respiratory Complications: The diminished breath sounds and presence of crackles on lung auscultation could indicate respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can impair gas exchange and lead to hypoxemia and respiratory failure.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor cardiac output (e.g., tachycardia, cool extremities) raise concerns for cardiogenic shock. This condition occurs when"

   depressions in lateral leads.  STE in III > II.  Cath showed thrombus
   in proximal RCA, not amenable to export catheter with ease, likely
   representing subacute thombus.  Patient s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1285**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 to prox-mid RCA.
   Found to have 70% stenosis of LAD that was not intervened upon.
   Integrillin therapy completed. Patient fluid avid s/p multiple episodes
   of emesis yesterday, received 3.5L IVF yesterday with improvement in
   UOP. IABP removed on [**1-9**]. Dopamine being weaned.
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily,  ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - hold off on beta-blocker as the tachycardia is likely compensatory
   - wean dopamine

   # PUMP:  Patient's RHC demonstrated RV pressures of 44/20, RVEDP 23,
   Mean Wedge 29, PA pressure 44/30/39(mean).  LV gram was not performed
   as concern for dye load.  Not grossly volume overloaded on R on exam.
   Patient's lungs clear anterolaterally, saturating 97% 2LNC.  Currently
   with IABP to reduce cardiac demand.  TTE from [**1-8**] demonstrates an EF
   40%, dilated and hypocontractile right ventricle, c/w right ventricular
   infarction. Moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension. Dilated aorta.
   - wean dopa as possible
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in NSR and with femoral venous sheath if needing
   to introduce pacer wire.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  HTN:  Currently on Dopamine, weaned from 5 to4 yesterday and
   currently with IABP in place.
   - Hold off on antihypertensives
   - Continue Dopamine today, do not wean
   .
   # DM II: Glucose on admission high in the 400s, started on Insulin gtt
   with improvement in FSG
s. Range 106-145 over the past 24 hours.
   HgbA1c 6.2%. Transitioned to fixed dose & sliding scale
   - Goal glucose 120-150

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the right coronary artery (RCA) distribution. The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Cool feet: The patient has poor distal perfusion on admission, with diminished radial and dorsalis pedis pulses, indicating possible peripheral arterial disease or vasoconstriction due to the use of pressors and sympathetic drive. Heparin and fluid resuscitation have been initiated to address this issue.

2. Tachypnea and anxiety: The patient has increased respiratory rate and demonstrates signs of anxiety. This may be due to baseline anxiety or an underlying respiratory condition. Furosemide was given initially, but without significant improvement in urine output. Lorazepam was also administered, but the tachypnea persisted. Further evaluation is needed, considering the possibility of metabolic acidosis as indicated by the elevated anion gap and lactic acid levels.

3. Metabolic acidosis, compensated: The patient has an elevated anion gap on both days, suggesting the presence of metabolic acidosis. The lactic acid level is elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. Diabetic ketoacidosis and renal failure are also potential causes. Fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary.
