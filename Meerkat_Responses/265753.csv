","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis, schizophrenia, and dysrhythmia. She was admitted from NEBH with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an embolization procedure. She received 12 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to hematemesis (upper GI bleed), but no bleeding was found during the interventional radiology (IR) procedure. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been fluctuating, with a stable level of 29.4 but a subsequent drop to 25-26. She has been transfused with pRBCs and is currently on maintenance fluids. She has altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. Her respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and her ABG shows a pH of 7.30. She has a history of altered nutrition, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hematemesis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of GIB and recent hematemesis, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI caused by E. coli, and her immune system may be compromised due to her age and underlying health conditions.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood transfusions, which can lead to fluid overload or electrolyte"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, urinary tract infection (UTI), and upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with multiple interventions and assessments.

24-hour events include the start and stop of a multi-lumen line on 05/15/2145, as well as the transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBC) due to a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels from 29.4 to 25-26. The patient also had another large melanic stool, which may indicate ongoing bleeding.

Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) between 75-92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/56 to 143/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///30.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 710 mL since 12 AM, with 335 mL given through intravenous fluids (IVF) and 173 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The total output includes 390 mL of urine, 260 mL of drainage from an unknown source, resulting in a negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of diverticuli admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient had a large melanic stool in the morning, which resulted in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, leading to a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
- The patient's hemoglobin levels remain low, indicating ongoing bleeding or inadequate resuscitation.
- Surgery was informed about the situation, and a discussion took place with the palliative care team regarding the patient's goals of care.
- The patient is currently stable, but at risk for further bleeding due to her age and medical history.
- Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/56 to 143/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age] year old [gender] with a chief complaint of altered mental status. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleed, urinary tract infection, and hematemesis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have been experiencing changes in their hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. They are receiving comfort care measures and have a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed indicates a potential risk for further bleeding. This can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed properly.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of a UTI increases the risk of complications such as sepsis and kidney infection. Proper antibiotic treatment and maintaining good hygiene practices are essential.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors including medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or organ dysfunction. Regular monitoring and addressing any underlying causes are crucial.
4. Hematemesis: The patient's history of hematemesis suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This condition can lead to significant blood loss and may require urgent endoscopic intervention.
5. Nutrition Alteration: The patient's alteration in nutrition may contribute to poor overall health and delayed wound healing. Nutritional support through enteral or parenteral routes may be necessary depending on the patient's condition.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with an altered mental status and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU for comfort measures and comfort-focused care.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure within normal ranges. However, her respiratory rate is on the lower end of the normal range, and her oxygen saturation is 96% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,329 mL and an output of 1,650 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 321 mL. This indicates that the patient is experiencing fluid loss.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) levels. Her platelet count, creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the chest and symmetric abdominal expansion. The neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsive state.

The patient's condition is complicated by several conditions, including gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, urinary tract infection, and upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is receiving comfort care and has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the gastrointestinal bleed, development of further infections, worsening of the urinary tract infection, and potential kidney dysfunction due"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and a difficult-to-locate and reverse specific source. The patient is considered a poor surgical candidate at this time. There have been recurrent and persistent slow blood loss from the GI tract, indicated by paroxysms of melena.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GI Bleed): The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and potentially result in hypotension, shock, organ dysfunction, and even death if not managed appropriately.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly stated in the progress note, older adults with decreased mobility and indwelling catheters are at higher risk for UTIs. This can cause symptoms such as fever, urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which may be related to the underlying medical conditions or medications. This can increase the risk of delirium, confusion, falls, and inadequate self-care.

4. Hematemesis (Upper GI Bleed, UGIB): Although the patient's primary issue appears to be LGIB, there is a mention of hematemesis (vomiting of blood). If this persists or worsens, it can lead to significant blood loss and the aforementioned complications associated with GI bleeding.
