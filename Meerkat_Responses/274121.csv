   [**9-19**] CT Head (Preliminary read):
   Hypoattenuating region in the left frontal lobe, and bifrontal subdural
   fluid
   collections are unchanged from one day prior on non-contrast study.
   [**9-19**] RUQ U/S: Nodular heterogenous liver is non-specific, but may be
   secondary to underlying liver disease. No evidence of cholecysitis.
   Small volume ascites
   [**9-19**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.
   [**9-17**] Stool culture negative for campylobacter, shigella, salmonella.
   [**9-19**] Blood cultures NGTD x2, Sputum gram stain >25 PMNs, 4+ GNR, 2+
   budding yeast. [**Doctor First Name **] (+) 1:160. Aspergillous antigen negative. Toxo PCR
   CSF negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will consider trial of holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves
   (overall coags are within baseline since admission)
   - Continuing to follow head CT
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Will follow up CT abdomen final read, and if LFTs further
   elevated, will check RUQ ultrasound to better evaluate gall bladder and
   CBD.
   -          RUQ as noted above.
   -          Cont to try to obtain outside records
   #) Hypernatremia: Was only getting 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will
   recheck in PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease.
- She presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria brain abscess.
- She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection.
- She has Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess.
- She has pancytopenia, which may be due to Imuran toxicity or other causes.
- Her elevated INR may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
- She has elevated liver function tests, which need to be monitored.
- She has hypernatremia and is receiving aggressive hydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The ABG results indicate the need to decrease FiO2 and continue with current ventilator settings. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the mental status does not improve.

2. Listeria Infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess. She is being treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, but there is a concern for endocarditis as a potential source of bacteremia. The presence of a focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve without aortic regurgitation on the transthoracic echo raises the possibility of aortic valve vegetation.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which may be due to Imuran toxicity or other causes. Monitoring of trend, transfusion if HCT <21-22 or symptoms, and repeat retic count is advised.

4. Elevated INR: The elevated INR may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies or other causes. Holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves and continuing to monitor for the possibility of DIC are recommended.

5. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which need to be monitored. Further evaluation of the gallbladder and CBD may be necessary if LFTs further elevate.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and aggressive hydration is being provided. Rechecking in PM and adjusting fluid intake accordingly is advised."

   Small volume ascites
   [**9-19**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.
   [**9-17**] Stool culture negative for campylobacter, shigella, salmonella.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will consider trial of holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves
   (overall coags are within baseline since admission)
   - Continuing to follow head CT
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Will follow up CT abdomen final read, and if LFTs further
   elevated, will check RUQ ultrasound to better evaluate gall bladder and
   CBD.
   -          RUQ as noted above.
   -          Cont to try to obtain outside records
   #) Hypernatremia: Was only getting 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will
   recheck in PM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have a listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is also experiencing pancytopenia, elevated INR, and hypernatremia. She has been treated with antibiotics for listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess. The patient's condition remains unchanged, and she is unresponsive to commands. Neurosurgery has decided to treat the frontal mass medically without surgical intervention. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a hypoattenuating region in the left frontal lobe and bifrontal subdural fluid collections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory status.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has a confirmed listeria brain abscess and bacteremia. There is a risk of complications related to the infection, such as abscess progression, meningitis, or sepsis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can increase the risk of infections, bleeding, and other"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She has pancytopenia, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and is on multiple medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process. There is a concern about removing the c-collar as it may limit the ability to easily re-intubate her if needed. Options include a trial of extubation or proceeding to a tracheostomy.

2. Listeria infection: The patient has listeria bacteremia and meningitis, with a suspected brain abscess. She is being treated with ampicillin and gentamicin. Further monitoring of culture data and consideration for tapping subdural collections if no improvement is seen.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has an elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which may be consistent with Imuran toxicity. Other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. Follow-up iron studies, DIC panel, and repeat retic count are planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection,
   with identified sites including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia,
   and possible subdural empyema.  Although the brain lesion has not been
   biopsied, I agree with consultants that the pre-test probability for
   Listeria abscess is so high that risks outweigh benefitis at present.
   Similarly, subdural empyema is possible.
   Listeria monocytogenes infection
   Appreciate help from multiple consulting services.  We will continue
   systemic antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin, and follow gent
   levels.  I believe that the best balance of risks and benefits is
   continued antibiotics with watchful waiting for now; both the abscess
   and the subdural collection may well resolve without surgical
   intervention.  Case discussed with ID.
   Ongoing fevers
   Appreciate ID
s help.  This is most likely to be related to her
   Listeria.  RUQ ultrasound reassuring.  TTE was abnormal but not
   diagnostic for valvular vegetation; will consult TEE service today.
   Coma
   Appreciate neurology
s help.  EEG adequately excludes non-convulsive
   status.  We will ask neurology to help with prognostic information for
   the family.
   Hepatitis
   Will try to get outside records to help sort out the diagnostic data
   supporting autoimmune hepatitis, especially since Listeria sometimes
   presents with hepatitis.
   Respiratory failure
   This is essentially due to neurologic status.  Will evaluate clinically
   as our team gets to know Ms. [**Known lastname 949**].  If appropriate from a
   prognostic and patient-wishes standpoint, would consider comparatively
   early tracheostomy since I suspect that any neurologic recovery will be
   a matter of weeks to months.
   C-collar
   Review prior imaging.  Will ask trauma or spine surgery to evaluate
   prior to removal.

   Addendum
   Met with family for 30 minutes to provide updates on her status, our
   requests to neurology and infectious disease to provide best possible
   estimate for prognosis, and on likelihood that we will proceed
   expeditiously to tracheostomy this week unless prognosis is felt to be
   very poor.  All questions answered.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection, including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia, and possible subdural empyema. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to neurological status. It is mentioned that an early tracheostomy may be considered if appropriate from a prognostic and patient-wishes standpoint.

2. Hepatitis: There is a mention of hepatitis, possibly autoimmune hepatitis, which needs further evaluation. Listeria sometimes presents with hepatitis, so it is important to monitor liver function.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and transfusion is recommended when Hct is less than 21.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, and glycemic control should be assessed after tube feeds are resumed.

5. Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and has no spontaneous movement. An EEG has been done to exclude non-convulsive status.

6. Potential infection: The patient has a disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection, which requires ongoing systemic antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin. Regular monitoring of gentamicin levels is necessary.

7. Possible subdural empyema: There is a possibility of subdural empyema, and watchful waiting may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection, including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia, and possible subdural empyema. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is also in a coma and has ongoing fevers. The patient has anemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatitis, and is being treated with various antibiotics, including ampicillin and gentamicin. The patient's prognosis is uncertain, and further evaluations and consultations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily due to her neurologic status. There is a consideration for an early tracheostomy if appropriate and if the patient is expected to recover in weeks to months.
2. Listeria Infection: The patient has a disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection with identified sites including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia, and possible subdural empyema. This infection needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Coma: The patient is unresponsive and in a coma. Prognostic information for the family and further evaluation by neurology are needed.

   2. Unchanged bilateral low-density subdural fluid collections.
   3. No evidence for new hemorrhage, increasing edema, mass effect, or
   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)
   culture data.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will consider trial of extubation versus proceeding straight to
   tracheostomy.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

- The patient has had several medical events, including fever, hypotension, and positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin, heparin, phenytoin, and others.
- The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate.
- The patient's blood tests reveal leukopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile.
- The patient's imaging studies show evidence of SAH and bilateral low-density subdural fluid collections, but no new hemorrhage or significant changes.
- The transesophageal echocardiogram shows normal left atrium, no masses or thrombi, and trivial regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valves. However, there is a small amount of thickening and echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum, which could be consistent with abscess in the appropriate clinical setting.
- The patient's cultures are pending or show no growth since admission.

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She has respiratory failure and is likely to remain intubated for the foreseeable future. The team has decided to consult interventional procedures for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) given the expected prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to her altered mental status and seizures. There is a concern for complications if she were to be extubated and difficult to re-intubate. The team plans to consult interventional procedures for tracheostomy to secure the airway.
2. Listeria Bacteremia and Meningitis/Encephalitis/Abscess: The patient has listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess. The team is treating this with ampicillin and gentamicin. They will continue to follow culture data and monitor the patient's mental status and imaging.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which may be due to Imuran toxicity, B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or less likely malignancy. The team is"

   2. Unchanged bilateral low-density subdural fluid collections.
   3. No evidence for new hemorrhage, increasing edema, mass effect, or
   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)
   culture data.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 200 mL Q4H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Per family, lesion has been present for several
   months. Differential includes foreign object, infection, insect bite.
   No fluctuance or fluid expressed.
   - Will request dermatology consult for further evaluation, appreciate
   assistance.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant amount of sputum, no leukocytosis, and
   overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains unimpressive
   for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate treatment, and will
   have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today to collect further
   culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of complications if extubation fails or if the patient develops further respiratory issues.

2. Listeria infection: The patient has listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess. There is a risk of worsening mental status and potential neurological complications.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which may be consistent with Imuran toxicity. Monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to manage this condition.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which could be due to nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required.

5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has stable elevated LFTs, likely secondary to liver disease. Regular monitoring is necessary.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible losses. Free water repletion and careful management are needed.

   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely a Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. There are concerns about worsening mental status, and a repeat head CT will be done to check for any changes. The patient is being treated with ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria infection, and phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. The patient also has pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated liver function tests. Other assessments and plans include respiratory failure, hypernatremia, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's mental status and elevated respiratory rate pose a risk for complications if extubation fails or if she experiences respiratory failure while intubated.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a brain abscess. The infection needs to be closely monitored and treated to prevent further complications.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count. This condition requires evaluation and management to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated International Normalized Ratio, which indicates a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H

   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid

She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs. The patient is intubated for airway protection and her mental status and c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of ongoing respiratory failure due to her CNS process and altered mental status. There is concern that if the c-collar remains in place, she may not be easily re-intubated if she fails a trial of extubation.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess. It is important to continue treating this infection with appropriate antibiotics and monitor the response. Surgical intervention may be necessary if there is no improvement.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia with elevated MCV. This may be due to Imuran toxicity, B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or less likely malignancy. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies or other causes such"

   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. On admission, the patient had a fever and was found to have a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) with Staphylococcus aureus. The patient underwent de-escalation therapy and was started on appropriate antibiotics.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include:

1. Fever: The patient has had a persistent low-grade fever despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. This suggests that the infection may not be fully controlled.

2. Positive B-glucan: The patient's B-glucan levels were positive, indicating a possible fungal infection. However, the interpretation of this result is difficult due to the ongoing antibacterial therapy.

3. Neurological impairment: The patient has shown signs of prolonged seizures and fevers, which may indicate a neurological condition such as encephalitis or meningitis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

4. Chest CT findings: The patient's chest CT has shown stable findings, including a small pleural effusion and a pericardial effusion. These findings suggest potential inflammation or infection in the chest area.

5. Abdominal distention: The patient has presented with mild abdominal distention, which could be due to ascites or gastrointestinal issues.

6. Skin lesions: The patient has developed erythematous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been febrile since admission and has had multiple positive cultures indicating bacterial infections. The patient's condition remains unstable, and the prognosis is difficult to assess due to prolonged seizures and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and cultures should be performed to detect any signs of infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and organ function parameters is necessary to manage sepsis effectively.
3. Meningitis: Bacterial meningitis has been diagnosed, and the patient may be at risk for complications such as brain abscesses or ventriculitis. Repeated neurologic assessments and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
4. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has hemolytic anemia, which can lead to complications like acute kidney injury or cardiac issues. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels, blood counts, and electrolytes is crucial.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's organs, including the"

   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have lLsteria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - This AM FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons
   (no literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); sending Coombs test,
   will d/w Heme today
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17, check post-transfusion Hct
   - Repeat hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL today with trach
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She has pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated liver function tests. The patient also has hypernatremia and is at risk for volume depletion. There are several other medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed, including potential fungal infection, respiratory failure, and nutritional deficiencies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and may require long-term mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for complications if she fails extubation and is difficult to re-intubate.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely brain abscess. Treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin has been initiated, and it is important to monitor the response to antibiotics and culture data.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which could be due to Imuran toxicity, B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or malignancy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

   CT Chest [**9-21**]: Unchanged 3mm RML nodule; Ascites; tiny bilateral
   pleural effusion; small pericardial effusion (stable)
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, and will have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today
   to collect further culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure and has pancytopenia, elevated INR, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and hyperpigmentation. She is being treated with antibiotics for the listeria infection and is also receiving other medications such as phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, famotidine, and heparin prophylaxis. The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires ongoing monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of complications if extubation fails or if the patient develops further respiratory distress.
2. Listeria Infection: The patient has listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a possible brain abscess. If the infection does not respond to treatment, there may be worsening of her mental status and potential complications.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a potential bleeding risk. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other

   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been stable.
    If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for worsening edema
   or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible

   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She also has hypernatremia, hypotension, and a finger lesion with granuloma. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if extubation is attempted and the patient does not respond well, worsening mental status due to the Listeria infection or other causes, complications from the pancytopenia such as infection or bleeding, bleeding due to the elevated INR, liver dysfunction, dehydration or electrolyte imbalances due to hypernatremia, and further deterioration of the finger lesion."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. The patient has undergone various procedures including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-90s, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals small cracks in the lips, no bleeding, moist mucous membranes, and edematous upper lip. The neck is supple with a flat jugular venous pressure (JVP). The lungs are rhonchorous bilaterally without wheezes. The cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen is slightly distended with bowel sounds present and a PEG in place. The extremities show 1+ pitting edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 1 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, presenting with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and has undergone tracheostomy. The patient is currently on ampicillin and gentamicin therapy for Listeria infection. Her mental status has worsened, and there is concern for possible worsening edema or bleeding in the brain. She also has pancytopenia, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests, and a positive beta-glucan test indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and various interventions are being implemented to address her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are essential.
2. Worsening mental status: The patient's mental status has deteriorated, which may be attributed to the Listeria infection or other underlying causes. Frequent neurologic assessments and imaging studies will be necessary to evaluate for any changes in her condition.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which can be associated with medication toxicity, viral infections, or bone marrow suppression. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, sepsis, severe organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. The patient underwent various procedures including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, PEG insertion, and blood culture. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/52 mmHg to 142/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is described as unresponsive with no eye opening and small withdrawal response to noxious stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures should be performed.
2. Gastrointestinal leak: Due to the recent PEG insertion requiring two passes, there is a potential risk of gastrointestinal perforation or leak. Serial abdominal exams and close monitoring are recommended, along with a discussion about a gastrograffin study in 48 hours.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating overnight, indicating possible hemodynamic instability. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate"

   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 1 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ED recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and has undergone tracheostomy. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to her CNS process.

The patient also has pancytopenia, likely caused by Imuran toxicity, as indicated by elevated MCV and pancytopenia. Other possible causes include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she has received a blood transfusion.

The patient's elevated INR is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. There is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but the patient's coagulation status will continue to be monitored.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are overall stable, but there is evidence of liver disease, possibly due to Listeria infection. The patient's lipase is elevated, and further evaluation is needed.

The patient has persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible losses. She will need more free water repletion, but careful monitoring is required due to her CNS issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with several conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The note mentions that the patient underwent a bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, and PEG insertion on September 22nd. 

The patient's labs indicate hemolysis, but the peripheral smear is normal, and the bilirubin levels are down, making hemolysis unlikely. The patient's platelet count is low, and there are abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, TBili) and kidney function (creatinine, BUN). The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced (sodium, potassium). 

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but the respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube and is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system. 

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the fact that several assessments were not performed. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process. There is concern for worsening mental status, which could potentially lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and assistance with IP are required.

2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, which can progress to encephalitis and abscess formation. It is crucial to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy (ampicillin and gentamicin) and follow-up culture data. If there are any changes in imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, re-consult neurosurgery may be necessary.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, consistent with Imuran toxicity. Other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. Monitoring the trend, transfusing if HCT <21-22 or symptoms, and considering TPMT status for increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment are important.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure. She was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She has been on ampicillin and gentamicin since September 17th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate may be secondary to her CNS process. She is intubated for airway protection, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the intubation fails or if there are further complications.

2. Listeria infection: The patient has bacteremia and meningitis caused by Listeria, and there is a concern for worsening mental status. If imaging shows worsening edema or bleeding, neurosurgery consultation may be required.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which could be consistent with Imuran toxicity. Other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. Monitoring of trend and transfusion if HCT <21-22 or symptoms is recommended.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin K and FFPs have been given, and coagulation will be monitored every other day. DIC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and was found to have septic shock secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation and was admitted to the ICU.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has remained stable with no significant changes in her vital signs or neurological examination. However, she did experience a seizure episode this morning, which was treated with lorazepam. The head CT scan showed no new abnormalities.

The patient continues to receive gentamicin, ampicillin, furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lorazepam, keppra, insulin, lactulose, colace, senna, albuterol, Tylenol, and bisacodyl.

The patient's laboratory results show some fluctuations in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, and liver enzymes. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.49, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 30 mmHg, and normal oxygen saturation.

Radiology imaging, including a CT scan of the head and abdomen/pelvis, is pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizures and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on pressure support. The patient experienced hypernatremia and received 1L D5W, with sodium levels at 145. She was given 10mg of IV lasix in the afternoon. A follow-up head CT showed no change. Neurological examination showed more organized brainstem function, PERRL, dolls eyes (although still asymmetric), some flexion tone of the upper extremities, but still not responsive to noxious stimuli. The patient had a seizure episode this morning with right-sided facial twitching, which was controlled with 1mg of ativan. Stat head CT is pending. Neurology recommended 600mg IV keppra load if seizures are not responsive to ativan. The patient's HCT is down to 21 and a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed at the same time as the head CT. The patient appears to be attempting to open her eyes at times but is not responsive to verbal or tactile stimuli. She grimaces minimally when her abdomen is pressed.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
2. Listeria"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is on pressure support. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, Listeria infection, seizure, pancytopenia, elevated INR, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and increased pigmentation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive to verbal or tactile stimuli. She has minimal grimace when her abdomen is pressed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to her CNS process. Close monitoring of her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation is necessary.
2. Listeria Infection: The patient's Listeria infection may progress if not effectively treated. Monitoring of culture data and regular neurologic assessments are important.
3. Seizure: The patient may have recurrent seizures, especially if her electrolytes are not adequately managed. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment of seizures are essential.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia could worsen, leading to increased bleeding or infection risk. Regular monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and appropriate management of hematologic abnormalities are crucial.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR"

   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

The patient has been started on ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria infection. The goal is to maintain a serum gentamicin level <2 for once-daily dosing. There are concerns about worsening mental status, and if there are any changes in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, neurosurgery consultation will be sought.

The patient's pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, although other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. The patient's elevated INR is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Listeria can present similarly to viral hepatitis, and the patient's elevated lipase today should be rechecked.

The patient has persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible losses. She will need more free water repletion, but caution must be taken given her CNS issues. LR will be used for further fluid boluses.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Right-sided facial twitching: The patient experienced right-sided facial twitching in the afternoon, which did not break with 1 mg of ativan but broke with 2 mg. This could indicate seizures or seizure-like activity, and the neurology team recommended starting dilantin to control any potential seizure activity.

2. Transient hypotension after 3 mg of ativan: The patient experienced transient hypotension (low blood pressure) after receiving 3 mg of ativan. This can be a side effect of ativan and may require further evaluation and management.

3. Gentamicin dosing change: The patient's gentamicin dosing was changed from Q8H (every 8 hours) to Q12H (every 12 hours) due to high levels. This indicates that the previous dosing frequency may have resulted in excessive levels of gentamicin in the bloodstream, potentially leading to toxicity.

4. Gastrograffin study: The patient is scheduled to undergo a gastrograffin study, which is a diagnostic imaging procedure to assess the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the esophagus and stomach. The purpose of this study may be to evaluate the patient's ability to swallow or identify any abnormalities in the digestive tract.

5. Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's current condition is stable, but there have been some complications and changes in treatment. The patient experienced right-sided facial twitching, which broke with 2 mg of lorazepam and lasted for about 3 minutes. Neurology recommended starting dilantin at a loading dose of 500 mg now, followed by 500 mg in the morning, and then 100 mg three times a day. The patient also had transient hypotension after receiving 3 mg of lorazepam, which responded to a 500 cc normal saline bolus. Gentamicin dosing was changed to once every 12 hours due to high levels. Additionally, a gastrograffin study is planned for either Monday or Tuesday, and the team will be informed by the physician.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizures: The patient experienced right-sided facial twitching, indicating a seizure-like event. The neurology team has recommended starting dilantin, which is an anticonvulsant medication used to prevent seizures. Therefore, the patient is at risk of recurrent seizures if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension after receiving 3 mg of lorazepam. This could be due"

   - [**9-22**] bronch: >100,000 GNR, yeast
 not treating
   IMAGING:
   - CTH [**9-24**]: No acute changes
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  RSBI 72
   today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**].
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia;
   pt required 2 fluid boluses yesterday for low BP.
   -          SBT again today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on today, will need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc
   - F/U Neuro recs re: anticonvulsants
 Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100
   TID today, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow, QD on Wednesday, then stop Dilantin
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely a Listeria brain abscess. She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on pressure support. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, and her elevated respiratory rate is likely due to her CNS process. She has had several episodes of hypotension, requiring fluid boluses. The patient has pancytopenia, which is consistent with Imuran toxicity, and her INR is elevated but stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Her liver function tests are stable, and she has improved hypernatremia. There is also a question of increased pigmentation, which could be related to Addison's disease or hemochromatosis. The patient has Gram-negative rods in her sputum, but no evidence of infection. She has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate a fungal infection. The patient recently underwent a PEG placement, which required two attempts and is being closely monitored for evidence of leak or peritonitis."

   IMAGING:
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**].
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia;
   pt required 2 fluid boluses yesterday for low BP.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   [**Location (un) 305**]
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study [**Month (only) 305**]
   - IP following

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 73 bpm, blood pressure 100/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. The patient was noted to have decreased breath sounds in the left lung base and diffuse wheezing throughout the right lung. 

Initial laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 92 to 108 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 120 mEq/L. The patient also had thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 86 K/uL.

Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was started on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 310 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

During the course of hospitalization, the patient's condition has fluctuated. There have been episodes of subtle head movement and twitching"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  RSBI 77
   today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**].
   -          SBT again today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on today, will need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc
   - F/U Neuro recs re: anticonvulsants
 Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100
   TID today, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow, QD on Wednesday, then stop Dilantin
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure, and subsequent cultures revealed Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely brain abscess. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently intubated for airway protection. Her respiratory rate is elevated, likely due to her central nervous system (CNS) process. She is on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. Her recent labs show pancytopenia, which may be consistent with Imuran toxicity. She also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and an elevated INR, which could be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. She has hypernatremia, which has improved with D5W. There is a question of increased pigmentation, possibly due to medication or an underlying condition. Her imaging studies show stable head CTs with no evidence of mass effect or significant edema. She has a positive beta-glucan, which could indicate a fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. She is being monitored closely for evidence of a leak in the stomach/peritonitis following the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's current plan includes continuing seizure prophylaxis with Keppra and Dilantin, monitoring for any new neurological changes, and repeating LP to send modified cultures."

   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently intubated for airway protection. Her mental status remains altered, and she has intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures. She is being treated with ampicillin and gentamicin for the Listeria infection. Her pancytopenia is stable, but she has elevated coagulation studies, possibly due to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her liver function tests are stable, and she has hypernatremia, which is being managed with maintenance fluids. There is a question of increased skin pigmentation, and she has a positive beta-glucan, suggesting a possible fungal infection. She recently underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a plan to transition her to breathing trials and re-check ABG afterwards, with a possible transition to trach mask if tolerated.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely brain abscess. She is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, but monitoring for any changes in mental status or new neurological deficits is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following

She underwent tracheostomy and has been on invasive ventilation. Her current condition is stable on trach mask, but she has no response to verbal, tactile, or noxious stimuli. There are several medical complications that can arise, including respiratory failure, Listeria infection, seizure, pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, pigmentation changes, colonization with Acinetobacter, positive beta-glucan indicating possible fungal infection, and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and underwent tracheostomy. She is currently doing well on trach mask, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the tracheostomy becomes obstructed or if she develops further respiratory distress.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. There is a risk of continued infection and spread of Listeria to other organs.
3. Seizure: The patient has had intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures. If these activities are indeed seizures, there is a risk of further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU on [date] with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Upon admission, the patient was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with low oxygen saturation. Initial laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction. The patient was started on IV fluids and medications to stabilize blood pressure and heart rate.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient's condition has fluctuated. There have been multiple episodes of hypotension and tachycardia, requiring adjustments in medication dosages. The patient's respiratory status has also been concerning, with intermittent hypoxia and increased work of breathing. Mechanical ventilation was initiated to support the patient's breathing.

Neurological assessment revealed a decreased level of consciousness, with the patient not fully responsive. Imaging studies, including a head CT scan, showed no signs of intracranial bleeding or significant abnormalities. An EEG was ordered to further evaluate the patient's mental status changes.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, with ongoing losses through urine and stool. The patient's weight has decreased by approximately 1 kg since admission.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and slightly decreased platelet count. Other lab values, such as kidney function and electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with continued activity concerning for seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS
   process.  RSBI 77 today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study today, will follow up results
   - IP following

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including respiratory failure, Listeria infection, seizures, pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and potential increased pigmentation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to airway protection in an altered mental state. There is an ongoing effort to wean her off the ventilator and transition to a tracheostomy mask.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has bacteremia, meningitis, and a suspected brain abscess caused by Listeria. She is being treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and further cultures and tests are pending.
3. Seizures: The patient has had intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures. EEG monitoring has been requested to assess if these activities correlate with EEG evidence of seizures.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a decrease in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The cause is suspected to be Imuran toxicity, but other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, but remaining obtunded.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP this morning to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia), given PTT is normal this morning after holding
   subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - Will discuss B-glucan results with ID team, await results of LP,
   discuss empiric treatment and further sampling of mass.
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 48 hours (last 24 on
   EEG). Prior to that time, patient has had intermittent movements that
   could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching,
   mouth movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in
   distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Continue free water flushes at current
   rate.
   .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will discuss further with ID.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on a tracheostomy mask, remaining obtunded. The patient has respiratory failure, Listeria infection, seizure activity, pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, colonization of Acinetobacter in sputum, positive beta-glucan, and extensive peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and airway protection require ongoing respiratory support.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has bacteremia, meningitis, and a brain abscess caused by Listeria. This infection needs to be treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Seizure activity: The patient has intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures, especially considering the presence of a presumed abscess in the left frontal area.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count, which may be due to Imuran toxicity or other causes. Close monitoring and possible transfusion are necessary.
5. Elevated coagulation studies: The patient's PTT is elevated, possibly due to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient underwent tracheostomy and has been on a tracheostomy mask. She is currently on ampicillin and gentamicin for the infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She underwent tracheostomy on [**2124-9-22**]. She has been doing well on the tracheostomy mask, but there is a potential for continued respiratory failure if she does not wean off the ventilator or if she develops any complications such as pneumonia or tracheostomy site infection.

2. Listeria Bacteremia and Meningitis/Encephalitis/Abscess: The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, with a likely brain abscess. The infection is caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which is more common in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's recent immunosuppressed state due to treatment for autoimmune hepatitis may have predisposed her to this infection. Serial head CT scans have been stable, but there is a potential for worsening of the infection leading to further neurological complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, but remaining obtunded.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP this morning to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia), given PTT is normal this morning after holding
   subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - Will discuss B-glucan results with ID team, await results of LP,
   discuss empiric treatment and further sampling of mass.
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 48 hours (last 24 on
   EEG). Prior to that time, patient has had intermittent movements that
   could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching,
   mouth movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in
   distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure, diagnosed with Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has been intubated for airway protection and underwent tracheostomy. The patient remains obtunded. Her recent immune-suppressed state due to treatment for autoimmune hepatitis may have predisposed her to infection. Serial head CT scans have been stable, but there are concerns about intermittent seizure activity. The patient has been receiving ampicillin and gentamicin, and a lumbar puncture was performed to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures, and to exclude Nocardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on tracheostomy and intubated, which puts her at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, and there is a concern for a brain abscess. This can lead to further neurological complications.
3. Seizure: The patient has intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures, potentially due to the brain abscess.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has stable pancytopenia, which could be due to Imuran toxicity or other causes like B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

   No evidence of tracheoesophageal fistula seen. No pooling of blood in
   the
   trachea or visualized bronchi seen. Moderate right and small left
   pleural
   effusions with compressive atelectasis.
   [**9-29**] MRI:
   PFI: Left frontal lesion demonstrate more increased enhancement with
   intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess. Additional areas
   of
   slow diffusion are seen in the right frontal lobe and left parietal
   region as
   before. New small areas of enhancement are seen in the right frontal
   lobe and
   right caudate head. Bilateral frontal, parietal, subdural fluid
   collections
   are seen with mild indentation of the adjacent brain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient underwent tracheostomy and has been on a tracheostomy mask. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and is currently weaning off FiO2. The patient has been on antibiotics for Listeria infection, but there is a concern for possible fungal infection as well. She has shown improvement in her condition, with decreasing WBC count and no organisms seen in the CSF culture. However, there are still concerns about her mental status and the possibility of seizures. The patient has pancytopenia, which is concerning given her recent immunosuppressive treatment. There are also elevated coagulation studies, but they seem to be stable now. The patient's liver function tests are slightly elevated, and there are attempts to obtain records from previous hospitalizations. The patient has Acinetobacter in her sputum, but it is unclear if it is an infection or colonization. Finally, the patient has a positive beta-glucan, which could indicate a fungal infection, but imaging has remained stable and other indicators of infection have improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to the patient's altered mental status and need for airway protection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of pancytopenia, likely due to azathioprine, as well as a neurologic condition with poor prognosis. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. These include blood noted from tracheostomy, erosions seen on bronchoscopy, and a CT scan ruling out tracheoinnominate fistula. An MRI shows abscesses in the right frontal and parietal regions, with new areas of enhancement seen in the right frontal lobe and right caudate head. EEG results indicate severe encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheoinnominate fistula: Although initially suspected, a CT scan ruled out this condition.
2. Tracheoesophageal fistula: The CTA neck showed no evidence of this.
3. Abscesses: The MRI revealed abscesses in the right frontal and parietal regions, indicating a possible central nervous system infection.
4. Encephalopathy: The EEG results indicate severe encephalopathy, suggesting impaired brain function.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding problems.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurologic condition is worsening, as evidenced"

   pleural
   effusions with compressive atelectasis.
   [**9-29**] MRI:
   PFI: Left frontal lesion demonstrate more increased enhancement with
   intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess. Additional areas
   of
   slow diffusion are seen in the right frontal lobe and left parietal
   region as
   before. New small areas of enhancement are seen in the right frontal
   lobe and
   right caudate head. Bilateral frontal, parietal, subdural fluid

   are seen with mild indentation of the adjacent brain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. Given that patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease.
- She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and brain abscess.
- She underwent tracheostomy and has been on a tracheal mask for over 72 hours without significant secretions or pneumonia.
- The patient experienced hemoptysis yesterday, but no further bleeding has been noted. A CT angiography ruled out a tracheo-innominate fistula.
- Her recent immunosuppressed state may have predisposed her to infection.
- Serial head CT scans have been stable.
- She has been on ampicillin and gentamicin since September 17th, and the dosing of gentamicin was adjusted based on levels.
- The expected treatment duration is several weeks, depending on CSF culture results, final MRI read, and input from ID and neurology teams.
- A lumbar puncture supports the clearing of infection, especially with the improvement in fever curve and other hemodynamics.
- Monitoring culture data is negative for growth, and Cryptococcal antigen is negative.
- There is a concern for possible CNS lymphoma, and hematology has been re-consulted for further evaluation, including flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a complex medical history. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and has been on a tracheostomy mask. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, elevated liver function tests, colonization of Acinetobacter in sputum, and positive beta-glucan indicating a possible fungal infection.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with diminished mental status and intermittent seizure-like activity. Imaging studies, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and meningitis, are present. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) for the Listeria infection, and the levels of these medications have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's blood counts are decreasing, indicating pancytopenia. This could be due to the immunosuppressive agents she has been receiving for autoimmune hepatitis. There is concern for a hematologic malignancy, and a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary for further evaluation.

The patient's coagulation studies show elevated levels, which have stabilized after discontinuing subcutaneous heparin. The elevated liver function tests may be secondary to liver disease, and the patient's history of autoimmune hepatitis could contribute to this.

   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.

   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 14). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: WBC and HCT improved today, however platelets slightly
   down. Patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs
   and smear have not been consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and has been on a tracheostomy mask, showing marked improvement in mental status overnight. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as fungal infection or endocarditis. Listeria was noted in blood and CSF cultures, and she has been on appropriate antibiotics. There is also concern for possible CNS lymphoma and pancytopenia. The patient's coagulation studies are elevated, but stable, and liver function tests are slightly up. There is an attempt to obtain records from a previous admission where the patient had near fulminant hepatic failure. The patient has been diagnosed with ileus and is receiving IV lasix for diuresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fungal infection: Given the new lesions on MRI, there is concern for a fungal infection. Empiric anti-fungal coverage has been initiated, and cultures are pending.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's TEE was abnormal, but no definite vegetation or abscess was seen. Further evaluation is needed to rule out endocarditis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's WBC and HCT have improved, but platelets are slightly down."

The patient is currently in the ICU for management of SAH, bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hemolytic anemia, and possible fungal infection or endocarditis with septic emboli. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and treatments, including an MRI, blood cultures, a central line tip culture, a CSF culture, and a KUB imaging study. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, antiepileptics, pain relief, and diuretics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 118/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels, except for slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. Imaging studies show no gross free air in the abdomen, but mildly distended loops of small and large bowel, likely due to ileus.

   Left lateral decubitus view is nondiagnostic for free intraperitoneal
   air due
   to motion artifact, but no gross free air is evident on this limited

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. Given that patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.

   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has shown improvement in her condition, with no significant secretions to suggest pneumonia. However, she experienced hemoptysis and blood around her trach site, which was likely due to an erosion. The patient is being weaned off FiO2 and her ABG is reassuring. 

The patient also has pancytopenia, with stable cell counts today. There is concern for possible CNS lymphoma, and a bone marrow biopsy has been recommended. The patient's elevated coagulation studies are stable, and she has an increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment. Her elevated liver function tests are overall stable, but there may be a need to involve the liver team if laboratory values continue to worsen. 

The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate a fungal infection, but imaging has remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved. She is also being monitored for possible DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's current medications include ambisome, Keppra, gentamicin, Ativan, fentanyl, lansoprazole, insulin sliding scale, lactulose, col"

   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. WBC increasing. Given
   that patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient

   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Have started antifungal coverage in light of new lesions on MR and +
   beta-glucan

   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, presenting with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post tracheostomy. She is intubated for airway protection and has been doing well on trach mask for over 72 hours. The patient has active type/cross as well as additional peripheral IVs in event of additional significant bleeding.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed by weaning FiO2, currently at 35%. Hemoptysis occurred yesterday, and bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for fistula. No further bleeding has been noted.

The patient has been diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction), and anemia, hemolytic. Her laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, coagulation studies, and lactate levels. The patient also has elevated D-dimer levels, indicating possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

There are concerns regarding the possibility of fungal infection, as indicated by a positive beta-glucan test. However, imaging has remained stable, and all other indicators of infection have improved. Antifungal coverage has been started in light of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - PMV today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfuse today if Hct < 21
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of recent symptoms and conditions, including suspected endocarditis, neurological improvement, and potential complications such as aortic dissection or intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of fluid overload with peripheral edema. Laboratory results indicate electrolyte imbalances, specifically low potassium and magnesium levels, as well as elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, suggesting possible renal dysfunction. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, and other ICU medications. The patient's recent imaging studies show findings consistent with previous areas of abnormal diffusion but no new findings. The patient's overall condition appears to be improving, with ongoing evaluation for endocarditis and monitoring of gentamicin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a possible diagnosis of endocarditis. This condition can lead to serious complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, abscess formation, or embolic events.
2. Aortic dissection: The presence of aortic root dilation or involvement in the patient's medical history increases the risk of aortic dissection. This condition is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention.
3. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's neurological symptoms and imaging findings may raise concerns about the possibility of an intracranial hemorrhage."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfuse today if Hct < 21
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Will fit for PM valve today. Doing well on trach mask.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis:  No further bleeding noted.
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status: Increasingly alert.
    - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Fungal etiology might be responsible for frontal head mass (given
   that all indicators of infection have improved, and her head masses
   have no worsened without treatment for fungal infection). Started on
   Ambisome
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. WBC increasing. Given
   that patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process).
    Hematology was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow
   biopsy for further evaluation and ? of CNS lymphoma
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
    Pneumoboots for now for DVT prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Have started antifungal coverage in light of new lesions on MR and +
   beta-glucan
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on a tracheostomy mask. She has hemoptysis but no further bleeding was noted. 

The patient is diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), and hemolytic anemia. She is also suspected to have a Listeria brain abscess.

The patient's respiratory failure required intubation and tracheostomy for airway protection. Hemoptysis was initially noted but has since resolved. 

Regarding the patient's infection, she started on ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis. The levels of gentamicin were adjusted based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The treatment duration will depend on the results of CSF culture, final read of MRI, input from ID and neurology teams, and is anticipated to be several weeks.

A lumbar puncture (LP) was completed on 9/28, which supports the clearing of infection, especially given the improvement in fever curve and hemodynamics. Cryptococcal antigen was negative, and modified cultures were sent for fungal and AFB testing. Monitoring of culture data is ongoing.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and

   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased

   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging. Awaiting repeat TEE to evaluate
   for endocarditis/abscess.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Continue heme/onc work-up as below
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in

   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: Cards following. EKG without conduction
   abnormalities.
   - Plan for repeat TEE today
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease. She presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on a tracheostomy mask. Her mental status has shown improvement overnight. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pancytopenia, aortic valve abscess, elevated coagulation studies, elevated liver function tests, colonization with Acinetobacter, and a possible right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. She has undergone tracheostomy and is doing well on the tracheostomy mask. However, weaning FiO2 should be done cautiously as the patient had an episode of hemoptysis.

2. Listeria Bacteremia and Meningitis/Encephalitis/Abscess: The patient's mental status continues to improve, suggesting a positive response to the current treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin. However, there is still a concern for potential fungal infection and neoplasm.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count has improved, but the hematocrit level is decreasing. Ongoing concerns include malignancy and a possible bone"

   Microbiology: [**10-2**] sputum:
    2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   GNR in Sputum f/u CXR, await speciation
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: TEE negative
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, severe sepsis, and hemolytic anemia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.9°C
- Heart rate: 76-162 bpm
- Blood pressure: 109/54 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15-27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on T-piece with FiO2 35%

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Ambisome, gentamicin, and ampicillin. They are also being given furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine levels are within normal range. Glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings above normal.

Imaging shows a CXR, but there is no mention of any specific findings. The microbiology results from sputum on 10/2 indicate the presence of gram-negative rods.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, no murmurs, and intact eye movements. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. However, there is limited movement on the right side, while the left side can move fingers and toes in small amounts.

   Microbiology: [**10-2**] sputum:
    2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   GNR in Sputum [**10-2**] f/u CXR, await speciation.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs; - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure
   activity noted on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   Transfuse today
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. SC Heparin
   .
   #) Autoimmune Hepatitis: LFTs slight trending up. Likely consistent
   with known liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high.
   Records have been obtained and are present in back of patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and has been doing well on tracheostomy. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure and is weaning off FiO2. She has had an episode of hemoptysis, but bronchoscopy and CTA were reassuring. There is GNR in the sputum, and a follow-up CXR is pending. The patient is continuing with ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis. 

The patient also has pancytopenia, with improvement in WBC but a decrease in Hct. She has been off immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, and labs and smear have not been consistent with hemolysis. TPMT returned positive, suggesting an increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment. There is an ongoing concern for malignancy, and a hematology reconsult has been done. F/u cytometry will be considered, along with a bone marrow biopsy. 

The patient's coagulation studies are stable, with an elevated INR that is likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. DIC appears to be less likely, but monitoring will continue. 

There are also issues related to autoimmune hepatitis, with LFTs trending"
