   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases. He has a VP shunt and is currently in the ICU for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns of an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient has been experiencing pain and is being managed with prn morphine. His mental status is altered, and it is likely due to a combination of pain medications and infection. There are no signs of seizures.

The patient also has hypoxemia, and he carries a diagnosis of asthma but has a smoking history and late age of diagnosis, which makes COPD/emphysema more likely. The altered mental status is likely contributing to hypoventilation.

The patient has non-small cell lung cancer and received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago. There is a need to touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today, but it is likely no need for a formal consult. Ongoing goals-of-care discussion should be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has signs of peritonitis on examination, indicating a possible abdominal abscess. This condition can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is suspected to be infected, as evidenced by the concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. Infections associated with sh"

   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology in AM; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain metastases, and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. 

The patient's chief complaint is pain, and he has been managed with prn morphine. He also has nausea/vomiting as an allergy. 

He has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses, for an abdominal abscess and potential VP shunt infection. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106-159/70-93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals occasional moaning and difficulty understanding the patient, tender and rebound abdominal examination, and heart rhythm in sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and potassium levels, along with decreased platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: 

1. Abdominal abscess, with peritonitic signs on exam. The plan is to check cell count, gram stain, and cultures from the"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases, who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and concern for an abscess. The patient also has a ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt for increased intracranial pressure, which was placed due to his brain metastases. The patient has been experiencing waxing and waning multiple sclerosis (MS) and was previously treated for meningitis. 

The patient underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of a fluid collection yesterday and was transferred to this hospital for concern of V-P shunt infection. However, the neurosurgery team does not feel that the shunt is infected, and the general surgery team agrees that no surgery is currently indicated. Instead, conservative management with drainage will be pursued.

The patient did well overnight and his MS improved. His allergies include Percocet, which causes nausea and vomiting. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and ceftriaxone, for suspected infection. He is also on various other medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, albuterol, spiriva, celexa, and colace.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-166 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and"

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of general surgery who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock. The patient has been experiencing delirium, increased heart rate and blood pressure, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a new pulmonary embolism. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and was intubated. Chest X-ray showed no change, but a CT pulmonary angiography revealed severe emphysema and a spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe. The patient's temperature is elevated at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and cultures were obtained from the blood, urine, and ascites. The patient's allergies include Percocet (oral) and nausea/vomiting. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 08/05/2181. The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Other medications include morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and haloperidol. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 129/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and a history of brain metastases, who was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient's recent events include being placed on invasive ventilation, having blood and urine cultures taken, and experiencing delirium, agitation, increased heart rate and blood pressure, shortness of breath with wheezing, and a new cardiac finding suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was intubated and a CTPA showed severe emphysema and a spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe, but no PE. The patient received 60 IV Solumedrol and their antibiotic regimen was changed from ceftriaxone to ceftazidime for pseudomonal coverage, with the addition of flagyl. The patient has allergies to Percocet (oxycodone/Acetaminophen) and experiences nausea/vomiting. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.4 axillary, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 129/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on non-rebreather mask with supplemental oxygen. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,530 mL total in, 230 mL total out, with a net intake of 2,300 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous breaths allowed. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 388 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 32 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 10.3 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 175 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29.5 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 112 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) level of 138 mEq/L, among others. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular or neurologic findings, and the skin is not assessed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Will try Fentanyl patch now while on drip so that when drip is weaned
   off hopefully will have coverage with patch by then
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases, who was transferred for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
- The patient started on invasive ventilation and had blood and urine cultures taken.
- The patient developed delirium, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself.
- The patient's mental status worsened, leading to increased agitation and shortness of breath.
- The patient was given haloperidol to manage delirium and subsequently became more sedated with decreased heart rate and blood pressure.
- The patient then became short of breath again and wheezing, suggesting a possible asthma attack or COPD exacerbation.
- Nebulizers were administered, but the patient continued to experience respiratory distress.
- A chest X-ray showed no interval change, and a CT chest revealed severe emphysema and a new spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe.
- The patient's condition stabilized with the administration of Haldol and nebulizers.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.4 axillary, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 129/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases. He has been admitted to the ICU due to various medical complications.

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has ascites fluid consistent with bacterial peritonitis, with WBC count greater than 250. He is receiving ceftazidime and flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Gen surgery does not believe there is an acute abdomen or reason to operate at this point. They recommend serial abdominal exams.

2. CNS infection around shunt: There is a concern for CNS infection around the VP shunt. Empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime are being administered for CNS penetration. A neurosurgical consult has been obtained, and they do not observe meningeal signs. They suggest culturing if shunt has purulent drainage on inspection. Reviewing imaging with radiology and neurosurgery is planned.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. There is no evidence of seizures. Serial neuro exams are being conducted, and pain management will be optimized while avoiding psychoactive medications. Levetiracetam has been started (switching to IV).

4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma but has a significant smoking history and late age of diagnosis, making COPD"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases, who has been admitted to the ICU for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He also has hypoxemia/wheezing and carries a diagnosis of asthma, although his smoking history and late age of diagnosis make COPD/emphysema more likely. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and a CT chest has shown severe emphysema, a spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe, and new nodules including a 10mm spiculated lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal abscess: The patient's ascites fluid analysis shows signs of bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. He is currently being treated with ceftazidime and flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. However, the patient is not considered a good surgical candidate because he received Avastin two weeks ago. Serial abdominal exams will be performed to monitor the patient's condition.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is receiving empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime for CNS penetration. Neurosurgical consult is pending, and cultures will only be obtained if the shunt shows purulent drainage on"

   No findings to suggest intracranial infection or VP shunt infection.
   Interval
   progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally
   worrisome for metastatic disease; however, no enhancing lesions were
   identified. Further evaluation with MRI would be beneficial.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets. He has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current health status includes:
- Fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F) and current temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate ranging from 86 to 120 beats per minute
- Blood pressure ranging from 91/79 mmHg to 151/98 mmHg
- Respiratory rate ranging from 15 to 28 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support
- Sinus rhythm

The patient is currently on ventilator support in the ICU due to hypoxemia and wheezing, which may be related to asthma or COPD/emphysema. He has also been diagnosed with an abdominal abscess and is receiving antibiotics coverage. There are concerns about CNS infection around the VP shunt, and the decision to pull the VP shunt is being considered. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system from cancer treatment and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Respiratory failure: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets. He has a VP shunt due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

2. The patient has an abdominal abscess with peritonitic signs on exam. He is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.

3. There is a concern for CNS infection around the shunt, for which the patient is receiving empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime.

4. The patient has altered mental status before intubation, likely due to delirium from pain medications, infection, or pain itself. Neurosurgical consult is considering pulling the VP shunt today.

5. The patient has hypoxemia and wheezing, with a diagnosis of asthma. However, the history of smoking and findings on CT scan suggest that COPD/emphysema is more likely. This could also be explained by aspiration during sedation overnight.

6. The patient received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago, and it is unclear how this informs management for the wife.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Infection due to the abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
- Delirium due to pain medications, infection, or pain itself.
- Respiratory complications such as hypoxemia and wheezing"

   5. Bronchomalacia of the right main bronchus and intermedius bronchus,
   evoked by expiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
 on OR schedule
   - F/U final read
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets, who was transferred for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition.

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has an abdominal abscess, as indicated by peritonitic signs on exam and elevated WBCs in ascites fluid. This could lead to further infection and potentially result in septic shock if not treated promptly.

2. CNS infection around shunt: There is a concern for CNS infection around the VP shunt, as evidenced by the administration of empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime for CNS penetration. If left untreated, this could lead to meningitis or other serious central nervous system infections.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. This can potentially progress to delirium and affect the patient's ability to communicate or follow commands.

4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has hypoxemia and wheezing, which may be attributed to underlying asthma, COPD/emphysema, or aspiration. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation if not managed properly.

5. Non-small cell lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer appears to be progressing despite receiving"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases. He is currently in the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his current condition and underlying conditions. Some potential medical complications include:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of an abdominal abscess, peritonitis, and a possible CNS infection around the VP shunt. Empiric antibiotics are being administered to cover potential pathogens.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. It will be challenging to balance pain management and delirium in this patient.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient has hypoxemia and wheezing, which could be attributed to asthma, COPD/emphysema, or aspiration. He has been intubated and is receiving bronchodilators and steroids for likely COPD exacerbation.

4. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's lung cancer appears to be progressing despite receiving bevacizumab treatment. This may impact his management and treatment options moving forward.

5. VP shunt complications: The possibility of complications related to the VP shunt, such as infection or malfunction, needs to be considered.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with metastatic lung cancer. They have been experiencing respiratory failure, an intraabdominal abscess, and a V-P shunt. The patient also has a history of brain XRT and CT changes, which may be contributing to their delirium. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's main barrier to extubation is altered mental status/delirium. If the delirium persists or worsens, it may lead to further respiratory compromise and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Intraabdominal abscess: Although the drain in the abscess is currently negative for infection, there is still a risk of recurrence or spread of infection. This could lead to sepsis and systemic inflammation.

3. V-P shunt: The possibility of surgical intervention for the V-P shunt is mentioned. Complications associated with this procedure could include bleeding, infection, or neurological damage.

4. Delirium: The patient's prior history of brain XRT and CT changes may be contributing to their delirium. Minimizing sedation is part of the plan to address this issue. If delirium persists or worsens, it may impact the patient's overall prognosis and recovery.

5. Metastatic lung cancer: As the patient has metastatic lung cancer, there is a risk"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with metastatic lung cancer. They are currently in the ICU and have experienced several medical events over the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 86-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/80 mmHg to 151/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,562 mL and output of 1,790 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 228 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 104%, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 30 mEq/L, and base excess of -6. The patient's Ve (minute ventilation) is 11.3 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 208.

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 10.0 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 122 K/uL, sodium (Na+) level at 140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level at 0.4 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) level at 30 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg2+) level at 1.7 mg/dL, and calcium (Ca2+) level at 8.9 mg/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 96 mg/dL and 147 mg/dL.

Imaging studies reveal an increased size of lesions on the right side and new lesions on the left side of the chest, with no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's drain output is 450 mL.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, intraabdominal abscess, V-P shunt, and delirium. The patient is expected to undergo surgery for the V-P shunt possibly today. Efforts will be made to minimize sedation and extubate the patient after the operation. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain metastases, and a VP shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns of an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He underwent VP shunt removal last evening, and a head CT showed trace intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital region but no significant interval change post shunt removal. The patient has been restless since this morning, and his sedation was changed to propofol. The goal of extubation today is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has an abdominal abscess and is currently being treated with antibiotics. If he develops peritoneal signs, surgical intervention may be necessary. It is important to monitor his abdominal exams and watch for any changes in blood pressure, as hypotension may indicate sepsis.

2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient had a CNS infection around the shunt, for which he received empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime. The VP shunt was removed last evening, and the neurosurgical team will follow up with serial exams and culture data. It is important to continue antibiotic treatment and follow up with cultures of the VP shunt tip and final read of the post-op head CT.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider haldol prn for agitation if pain controlled and still
   delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

   Disposition: ICU until extubated and stable
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has signs of an intra-abdominal infection, as indicated by peritonitic signs on exam and elevated white blood cell count in the ascites fluid. This is concerning and requires close monitoring. If the patient develops acute abdominal symptoms or signs, surgical intervention may be necessary.

2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient has a VP shunt in place, which can be a source of infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated to cover for CNS penetration. Neurosurgical consultation is needed to further evaluate and manage this condition.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including pain medications, infection, or pain itself. Propofol has been started for sedation to allow for serial neurologic examinations.

4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and wheezing, which may be related to underlying asthma or COPD. A CT scan of the chest has shown severe emphysema. It is important to continue respiratory support and wean off the ventilator as soon as possible.

5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer and is currently receiving bevacizumab treatment. The disease appears to be progressing, and further treatment options need to be discussed with the oncology team"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who had their shunt removed yesterday and continues to have fevers. They are currently on CPAP in the ICU. The patient has ongoing respiratory failure due to COPD and delirium, with agitation posing a barrier to extubation. Propofol is being used to manage delirium. Pain management involves fentanyl at a rate of 12.5mcg/min, with low-dose IV dilaudid for additional pain relief. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 576 mL since midnight. Blood cultures were taken multiple times. The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows a small residual amount of blood on head CT and right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient remains in the ICU with full code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and negative fluid balance may suggest an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening complication characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure, elevated respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation indicate potential ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition that causes breathlessness"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient had a shunt removed yesterday and continues to have fevers. The patient is on CPAP support and has been experiencing respiratory failure due to COPD and delirium. The patient is agitated, which may be a barrier to extubation. Propofol is being used to manage delirium. The patient is also experiencing pain, for which fentanyl is being administered at a rate of 12.5mcg/min. Low-dose IV dilaudid is also being given for pain relief. The patient's V-P shunt was recently removed, and follow-up chest X-rays are planned. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient's continued fevers and the presence of an effusion/infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of an infection. The blood cultures taken on 08/07 and 08/08 indicate further investigation for bacterial infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to COPD and delirium. Agitation is a barrier to extubation, and the current management plan includes trying to drop down pressure support ventilation (PSV). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.

3. Delirium: Delirium is present in this patient, and propofol is being used for management"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and a VP shunt, admitted for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
- The patient had invasive ventilation stopped and started multiple times on 08/08/2181, and was eventually extubated and placed on a shovel mask.
- The patient received morphine and fell asleep, but later woke up with shortness of breath. Nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent were given, and the patient's ABG showed a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 56, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130.
- The patient continued to have increased work of breathing and tachycardia. Allergies include Percocet (oral), nausea/vomiting, and an allergy to morphine.
- The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole, and ceftazidime) as per the medical and family history.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/98 mmHg to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus tachycardia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required CPAP
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has a history of asthma but is more likely to have COPD/emphysema. He was intubated after experiencing hypoxemia and wheezing. The patient also has an altered mental status, which is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. There is no evidence of seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal abscess: The patient exhibits signs of peritonitis on exam, indicating an abdominal abscess. Cultures from the NG tube drainage are pending, and the patient is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: Empiric antibiotics have been started for CNS penetration, and the VP shunt has been pulled. Neurosurgical consult is planned with serial exams and culture data.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. Delirium is a concern, and sedation will be managed carefully to balance pain control and prevent worsening of delirium.
4. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient's lung cancer appears to be progressing despite receiving bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and a VP shunt, who was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require attention. 

1. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma, but his smoking history and late age of diagnosis make COPD/emphysema more likely. This could also be explained by aspiration when the patient was sedated overnight, which put greater stress on his already compromised lungs. No pulmonary embolism (PE) was found on the CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), but a follow-up final read is needed.

2. Abdominal abscess: The patient shows signs of peritonitis on examination. Cultures from the nasogastric tube drain (NGTD) at Hospital 1 were negative. Ascites fluid here shows WBCs >250, but gram stain is negative. The patient is being treated with Ceftazidime as well as Flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. No acute abdomen or reason to operate at this point, but if peritoneal signs develop, a repeat scan and call to the surgeon will be made.

3. CNS infection around shunt: Empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime are being administered for CNS penetration. Neurosurgical consult revealed no"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Difficult night, but much better on bipap
   currently.  CXR without evidence of fluid overload, also has COPD.
   Will start solumedrol
   to treat COPD.  Will also try some diuretics.
   Abdominal abscess:  Cultures all negative (although drawn after onset
   of antibiotics).  Continue antibiotics, will discuss with surgery how
   long antibiotics should
   continue.  Will check with [**Hospital1 **] if cultures there are also
   negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been experiencing respiratory failure. They were extubated yesterday but remained tachycardic and short of breath, necessitating the use of albuterol, atrovent, and morphine. Non-invasive ventilation was initiated, which improved their condition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm (with a normal range of 81-118 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 149/92 mmHg to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 12-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for more shortness of breath this morning. Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds in the chest, right and left radial pulses not assessed, right and left digital pulses (DP) assessed as 1+, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination incomplete.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 118 K/uL, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 83 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated lactic acid level and LDH level, as well as abnormal imaging showing increasing right lower lobe infiltrate versus effusion.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient continues to have respiratory failure, with the CXR ruling out fluid overload but noting COPD. Solumedrol will be started to treat COPD, and diuretics may be considered. The abdominal abscess cultures have all been negative, so antibiotics will be continued, and the plan will be discussed with surgery regarding the duration of antibiotic treatment. It is also mentioned that lung cancer and ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis, will be addressed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Difficult night, but much better on bipap
   currently.  CXR without evidence of fluid overload, also has COPD.
   Will start solumedrol
   to treat COPD.  Will also try some diuretics.
   Abdominal abscess:  Cultures all negative (although drawn after onset
   of antibiotics).  Continue antibiotics, will discuss with surgery how
   long antibiotics should
   continue.  Will check with [**Hospital1 **] if cultures there are also
   negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient was extubated yesterday but experienced tachycardia and shortness of breath, leading to the reintroduction of invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/92 to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including albuterol/atropine, morphine, and fentanyl patch.

24-hour events indicate the initiation and cessation of invasive ventilation on multiple occasions. The patient's allergies include Percocet (oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen) and nausea/vomiting. Antibiotics were administered, including Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's current weight, fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and laboratory values. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a bipap mask, CPAP/PSV mode, Vt ranging from 768-862 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR of 19 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, RSBI of 91, PIP of 14 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 192. The patient's neurologic exam is largely unremarkable, with the exception of diminished breath sounds on the right side and extremity weakness rated as 1+.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values indicate abnormal liver function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate versus effusion on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to struggle with respiratory failure, experiencing difficulty despite the use of bipap support. A decision has been made to start solumedrol to treat COPD and attempt diuretic therapy to address fluid overload. The patient also has an abdominal abscess, with cultures coming back negative. Antibiotics will be continued, and consultation with surgery will determine the duration of antibiotic treatment. There is also a concern for lung cancer, and the patient's ICU care will focus on nutrition, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status remains full code, and they will continue to be monitored in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] want to
   give more fluids.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases.
- He has a VP shunt for potential infection and is being evaluated for neurosurgical/surgical intervention.
- The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma but may have COPD/emphysema due to his smoking history and late age of diagnosis.
- He experienced acute shortness of breath with wheezing, but there were no signs of pulmonary embolism on the CT pulmonary angiography.
- He was weaned off respiratory support and now stable on a shovel mask.
- The patient has an abdominal abscess, but no signs of peritonitis were observed.
- Cultures from the nasogastric tube drainage and ascites fluid were negative, and he is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
- There is a CNS infection around the shunt with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods detected on the culture of the VP shunt tip.
- He is receiving vancomycin and ceftazidime for CNS penetration, and the VP shunt has been pulled.
- The patient has altered mental status, likely delirium from a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself.
- He is now more or less at baseline, and efforts will be made to balance pain management and delirium prevention.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and VP shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma but has a smoking history and late age of diagnosis, making COPD/emphysema more likely. This could be explained by aspiration when the patient was sedated overnight, causing stress on his already compromised lungs and leading to further obstruction.

2. Abdominal abscess: The patient exhibits peritonitic signs on exam. Cultures from NGTD are negative. He is being treated with antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens, including Ceftaz and flagyl. It is important to monitor for any signs of acute abdomen or worsening peritonitis, which may require surgical intervention.

3. CNS infection around shunt: The patient has been on empiric vancomycin and ceftaz for CNS penetration. Neurosurgical consultation reveals no meningeal signs, and the VP shunt has been pulled. Serial exams and culture data will be followed up on. Continued antibiotic therapy is recommended.

4. Altered mental status before intubation: The patient likely experienced delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. No evidence of seizures was observed. It will"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases, who was transferred for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
- He carries a diagnosis of asthma, but it is likely that he has COPD/emphysema given his smoking history and late age of diagnosis.
- He experienced hypoxemia and wheezing, but is now stable on a shovel mask.
- No pulmonary embolism was found on the CT pulmonary angiography.
- He was weaned off respiratory support and required BiPAP, but is now stable on the shovel mask.
- He received steroids for his acute respiratory distress and diuresis to remove excess fluid from his body.
- He has an abdominal abscess without peritoneal signs, for which cultures have been taken and antibiotics have been initiated.
- He also has a central nervous system infection around the VP shunt, with Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods identified on culture of the shunt tip.
- The VP shunt has been pulled, and neurosurgical consultation will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
- He is being treated with a combination of antibiotics to cover potential pathogens.
- Prior to intubation, he had altered mental status, likely due to delirium caused by pain medications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple severe conditions including respiratory failure, abdominal abscess, and lung cancer. The patient has shown improvement in their respiratory distress and MS symptoms. However, the patient remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory distress and history of severe COPD indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure, which may require prolonged ventilatory support.

2. Infection: The presence of polymicrobial flora in the V-P shunt suggests a risk of infection. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Vanco, Ceftaz, and Flagyl) to treat the infection, but there is still a potential for developing further infections, especially in the immunocompromised state.

3. Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal abscess has shown improvement, but there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening of the abscess. Close monitoring and appropriate management will be necessary to prevent any complications related to the abdominal area.

4. Lung cancer progression: Despite the improvement in MS symptoms, the underlying lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications such as spread of the cancer or respiratory complications.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic UF Heparin to prevent the development of DVT. However, due to the patient's critical illness and immobility, there is still"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off.
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. Repeat today
   to pull off more fluid as lungs still a bit wet.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma, although his smoking history and late age of diagnosis make COPD/emphysema more likely. He was weaned off respiratory support and now requires only a shovel mask. His abdominal abscess does not show peritonitic signs, and cultures from the NG tube do not show any growth. He is being treated with Ceftazidime and Flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. The VP shunt tip culture showed GPCs and GNRs, so he is receiving vancomycin, Flagyl, and Ceftazidime. The neurosurgical consult determined that there were no meningeal signs, and the VP shunt was pulled. The patient's altered mental status is likely delirium from pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He will continue to receive antibiotics, and pain management will be carefully balanced to avoid exacerbating delirium. The patient's non-small cell lung cancer is progressing, and his oncologist is aware of his status.

Potential medical complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;  Now resolving in
   steroid taper and only requiring NC for O2.
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask/NC
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off. (Will
   change to equivalent dosing of PO prednisone).
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain metastases, and a VP shunt. He was transferred for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient carries a diagnosis of asthma but is more likely to have COPD/emphysema given his smoking history, late age of diagnosis, and CT scan findings. He was treated with a steroid taper and now only requires nasal cannula for oxygen.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia/wheezing - resolving with steroid taper and NC for O2.
2. Abdominal abscess - no peritoneal signs on exam. Cultures from NGTD, ascites fluid, and VP shunt tip are pending. The patient is on Ceftaz and Flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
3. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of VP shunt. The shunt has been pulled, and the patient will continue with abx. Neurosurgical consult is planned.
4. Altered mental status before intubation, likely delirium from pain medications, infection, or pain itself. Now more or less at baseline.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer - received bevacizumab about 2 weeks ago and appears to be progressing. The wife wants him to receive treatment for it and"
