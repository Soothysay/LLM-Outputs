","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of bradycardia and is currently intubated but awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.
- The patient has several medical complications that require attention, including hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, respiratory distress, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
- He is being treated with antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) for an infection, and his renal function is being closely monitored.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are also being monitored due to his diabetes.
- He is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's current plan includes continuing vanc/zosyn empiric treatment, regular hemodialysis (HD), and attempting to wean sedation and extubate him today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable to hypertensive, but there is a concern for hypotension in the setting of bradycardia. It is important to closely monitor his blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia has resolved, but it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, pancreatitis, and allergies to ace inhibitors. He is currently admitted to the ICU and sedated. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving multiple IV medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and antibiotics. The patient has a nasogastric tube and is mechanically ventilated on assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 13. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,082 mL and output of 1,307 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose levels, and electrolytes are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors.
3. Infection at the site of arterial or dialysis catheter insertion.
4. Acute kidney injury (AK"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   s/p PEA arrest in the setting of bradycardia, hyerkalemia, currently
   intubated but awake alert.
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home kayexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and reported complaints of [**9-20**]
   back pain in CCU or prior, concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis,
   or aortic dissection. Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done
   today suggests colitis and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving
   tissue perfusion defect c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely.
   Likely will need f/u CT scan unless clinical improvement becomes
   obvious; if remaining intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest. Oxygenation appears to already be improving.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, but awake and alert. His condition is complicated by several medical issues, including bradycardia, hyperkalemia, possible pancreatitis, colitis, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive despite correction of hyperkalemia and bradycardia. This may indicate an underlying issue such as sepsis or poor perfusion. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Bradycardia: The patient experienced refractory bradycardia that required resuscitation. Hyperkalemia is likely the cause of his original bradycardia and syncopal episodes. Potassium levels should be closely monitored and corrected if needed.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with a high potassium level (K+ 7.3) and had an arrhythmia that resolved after short-term interventions. He also experienced symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting likely due to uremia/hyperkalemia. Dialysis was conducted, and the patient is currently on continuous renal replacement"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   82 year old man s/p apparent hyperkalemic PEA with unclear time until
   [**Name (NI) 4535**]. Making purposeful movements today. Got RRT overnight, now on
   holiday.  Hemodynamics normalized this morning. Plan as per resident
   note. Will need to DC sedation and look to extubate. Currently not
   overbreathing the vent. Reasonable to continue empiric abx for now but
   unclear if there has been a primary abdominal event. Further plans as
   per resident note.
   At the time of signing, patient was extubated. An interpreter was
   present this afternoon during RN assessment. Patient has no specific
   complaints. He appears to be mentating well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency transitioning to hemodialysis and recent fistula placement. He presented with one day of malaise and missed a dose of kayexalate for hyperkalemia. The patient then began experiencing low back pain, nausea, had pre-syncope, and was found vomiting and hypotensive by EMS.

Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was in junctional bradycardia with a heart rate of 15 beats per minute. Transcutaneous pacing failed, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]. The arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.02, potassium level of 7.3, and lactate level of 7.0, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient received epinephrine and atropine as well as hyperkalemia treatment at [**Hospital1 4535**].

The patient was intubated during the code and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU), where he was initiated on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). A chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomography (CT) scan revealed possible ischemic colitis and pancreatic edema consistent with pancreatitis.

The patient was later transferred from the CCU to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on dopamine"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a medical history of chronic renal insufficiency transitioning to hemodialysis, who presented to the hospital with a one-day history of malaise. He is currently on daily kayexalate for hyperkalemia and missed a dose, leading to symptoms such as low back pain, nausea, and pre-syncope. Emergency medical services were called, and upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was found to be vomiting and hypotensive. He was in junctional bradycardia with a heart rate of 15 beats per minute. Transcutaneous pacing failed, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]. 

On arrival, his arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.02, with elevated potassium levels of 7.3 and lactate levels of 7.0, indicating possible hyperkalemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Epinephrine and atropine were administered, along with hyperkalemia treatment, and the patient was intubated during the code. He was then transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) where he initiated continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). A chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan revealed possible ischemic colitis and pancreatic edema consistent with pancreatitis. The patient was subsequently transferred from the CCU to the medical intensive care unit ("

He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now stable. The patient has an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been on invasive ventilation, which was successfully extubated without complications. 

The patient had an unplanned removal of the femoral line, resulting in a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). He also experienced hypertension overnight, requiring intravenous prn hydralazine. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 179/59 mmHg to 193/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,272 mL and output of 1,185 mL, with a positive balance of 2,087 mL. He is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, hydralazine, and others.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now stable. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated without complications yesterday. He is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and receiving mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high, requiring intravenous hydralazine for overnight management. He has an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) for which vancomycin therapy has been initiated. The patient's CKD is being managed with hemodialysis (HD) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He is also being treated for diabetes mellitus with glyburide, and his glycemic control is monitored using regular insulin sliding scale (RISS).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. HCT drop associated with femoral line removal: This could be indicative of hemorrhage or blood loss. Immediate interventions include monitoring the hematocrit (HCT) levels closely, ordering blood crossmatching and typing, and transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, acute pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for pain control and management of his medical conditions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 179/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on invasive ventilation support, receiving 400 mL tidal volume at a rate of 20 breaths per minute, with an FiO2 of 80%. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Renal complications: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to factors such as nephrotoxic medications, hypotension, or sepsis.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications like pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now being treated in the ICU for an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, CKD, and diabetes. The note mentions that the hypotension and bradycardia have resolved, but the patient remains hypertensive at times. The hyperkalemia has also resolved, although it was initially difficult to perform continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to issues with the vascular access line. 

The patient's CKD is secondary to his DM and HTN, and he is being transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This may be contributing to his hyperkalemia as well. The patient's diabetes is being managed with glyburide, but his blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored due to episodes of hypoglycemia.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and various prophylactic treatments such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated but later extubated without complication. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation support, but it was discontinued. He initiated the removal of his central venous catheter. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 113 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 179/59 mmHg to 193/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new onset crackles at the bases bilaterally. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's language barrier.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, amylase, lipase, liver enzymes, and low potassium levels. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab values including platelet count, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with hyperkalemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was intubated and extubated the previous day. The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors, cough, and a last dose of antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) on 12/2/2148 at 02:00 PM. 

On 12/4/2148 at 04:15 AM, the patient initiated the removal of his central line/catheter. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 116/50 mmHg to 193/72 mmHg, heart rate of 113 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on invasive ventilation support and is using a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. 

Physical examination shows no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and no hematoma at the site of the left groin line where the femoral code line was placed. Neurological assessment could not be performed due to the patient's intubation status. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 2.8-3.0 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 27 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (B"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual with a history of anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, acute and chronic pain, acute pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. They are currently admitted to the ICU and have been receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 190/65 mmHg to 135/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,561 mL and output of 1,845 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and no skin assessment due to language barrier. Neurological assessment is incomplete. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Renal function tests show increased creatinine levels, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. Other lab values include elevated lipase, lactic acid, and LDH levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing medical conditions including anemia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now stable. He has an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and other medical conditions including hypertension, CKD, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HCT drop: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels are decreasing. This may be due to self-discontinuation of femoral line. It is important to monitor and manage this issue by ordering a blood transfusion and repeating HCT levels.

2. Enterococcus UTI: The patient has a confirmed enterococcus UTI. Appropriate antibiotics should be started based on the sensitivity results. In this case, vancomycin IV has already been initiated.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains persistently high despite restarting antihypertensive medication. Further evaluation and adjustment of the treatment plan are necessary.

4. CKD: The patient's CKD is secondary to DM and HTN. He is being transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) due to ESRD. This may contribute to hyperkalemia, so renal function should be closely monitored.

5. DM: The patient is on glyburide for outpatient management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, acute pancreatitis, and chronic pain. The patient is currently on multiple medications including nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 2,157 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, creatinine, glucose, amylase, lipase, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and others. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's chronic renal failure, along with the use of nephrotoxic medications and fluid imbalances, puts him at risk for AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications and fluid therapy are essential.

2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Regular assessment of vital signs, white blood cell count, and cultures should be done to identify and treat any infection promptly.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia: The patient's history of type II diabetes mellitus and elevated glucose levels may predis"

   currently stable.
   # Hypertension :  Currently on losartan, hydralazine, imdur, minoxidil
   and remains hypertensive requiring nitro gtt.
   -avoiding nodal blockade in the setting of recent bradycardia
   -increasing dose of hydralazine to 75mg q6h
   -increasing imdur to 90mg daily
   -wean nitro gtt as able
   -increase minoxidil prn q3days (slow uptitration)
   -was on lasix at home and still making good urine; will clarify need
   for continued HD as below and if not going to have scheduled HD, will
   add back to regimen.
   # HCT drop: in the setting of self d/c of fem line.  CT scan without
   e/o RPB and no evidence of active bleeding from different source such
   as GI.  Hct stable after last transfusion on [**12-4**] (Required 2 units
   PRBCs total).
   -continue to monitor hct and exam for groin hematoma
   # Enterococcus UTI:   Sensitive to ampicillin which we have started.
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN.  Underlying cause of hyperkalemia on
   presentation.  Electrolytes and volume status have been stable, last HD
   session on [**11-4**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to hyperkalemia. He is currently stable in the ICU with ongoing treatment for hypertension, enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), and monitoring of chronic kidney disease. The patient has been receiving multiple medications and interventions, including nitroglycerin for hypertension, ampicillin for UTI, and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient remains hypertensive despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. There is a risk of complications associated with uncontrolled high blood pressure, such as stroke, heart attack, and organ damage.
2. Enterococcus UTI: The patient has a confirmed enterococcus UTI, which can lead to complications like urinary tract obstruction, sepsis, and kidney damage if not effectively treated.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's CKD is secondary to diabetes and hypertension, putting him at risk for further kidney damage and potential progression to end-stage renal disease.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient previously experienced hyperkalemia during his PEA arrest. This condition can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent recurrence.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and recent need"

","The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now in the ICU with an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently stable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 168/56 to 218/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving nitroglycerin and morphine sulfate infusions, as well as various other medications.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an arterial line in place since 03:20 AM, a peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line placed at 01:00 PM, and a dialysis catheter inserted at 01:30 PM. The patient has received a total of 773 mL of fluids since midnight, with 753 mL given through the IV fluids and 20 mL given orally. The patient has had a total output of 2930 mL, including 560 mL of blood products and 2930 mL of urine output.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with elevated potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed, including a drop in hemoglobin levels likely due to self-discontinuation of femoral line, enterococcus UTI for which vancomycin has been started, persistent hypertension despite medication adjustment, stage 4 CKD requiring transition to hemodialysis (HD) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus requiring close monitoring of blood sugar levels.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's elevated potassium levels may lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's CKD and impending ESRD could contribute to this electrolyte imbalance. Additionally, the patient's diabetes and hypertension may further complicate the management of his condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now stable in the ICU. He remains hypertensive despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications and requires nitroglycerin infusion. The patient has a recent drop in hemoglobin level due to self-discontinuation of femoral line and is being monitored for any signs of active bleeding. He has an enterococcus urinary tract infection, which is sensitive to ampicillin, and is being treated accordingly. The patient's chronic kidney disease is secondary to diabetes and hypertension and is being transitioned to hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease. This may be contributing to his hyperkalemia. His diabetes is managed with glyburide, but he has had episodes of hypoglycemia and is being monitored closely with frequent blood glucose checks. The patient has various lines and catheters in place, including an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. He is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: Despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications, the patient remains hypertensive, indicating a potential complication of uncontrolled blood pressure.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's chronic kidney disease"

   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   s/p PEA arrest in the setting of hyperkalemia now w/enterococcus UTI,
   currently stable.
   # Hypertension :  Currently on losartan, hydralazine, imdur, minoxidil
   and remains hypertensive requiring nitro gtt.
   -avoiding nodal blockade in the setting of recent bradycardia
   -increasing dose of hydralazine to 75mg q6h
   -increasing imdur to 90mg daily
   -wean nitro gtt as able
   -increase minoxidil prn q3days (slow uptitration)
   -was on lasix at home and still making good urine; will clarify need
   for continued HD as below and if not going to have scheduled HD, will
   add back to regimen.
   # Anemia: had HCT drop in the setting of self d/c of fem line.  CT scan
   without e/o RPB and no evidence of active bleeding from different
   source such as GI.  Hct stable after last transfusion on [**12-4**] (2 units
   PRBCs). Iron studies normal in [**9-18**]. Hemolysis labs negative here.
   -continue to monitor hct and exam for groin hematoma

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions including anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, pain control, acute pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 101 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 153/55 mmHg to 136/44 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,566 mL and output of 1,675 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 109 mL. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and has also been on dialysis since December 4th.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Blood glucose levels are high, suggesting poorly controlled diabetes. Other lab results, such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and pancreatic enzymes, are abnormal.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 9 cm, which could indicate fluid overload or heart dysfunction. Peripheral pulses are present in all extremities, but one of the right"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to hyperkalemia. He is currently stable in the ICU. The patient has difficult-to-control hypertension and a recent enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI). His vital signs are within normal range, except for an elevated heart rate. The patient has anemia and has had a femoral line removed. His hemoglobin concentration has stabilized after receiving a blood transfusion. He will continue to be monitored for anemia. The patient is also being treated for a UTI and has chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension. His last hemodialysis session was on [**12-4**]. He is restarting lasix today and will continue with renal follow-up. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2 and requires medication management. In terms of ICU care, the patient is on a cardiac and renal diet, with glycemic control maintained through RISS. He has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylaxis measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old Vietnamese male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease who presented with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the setting of hyperkalemia. He currently has an Enterococcus urinary tract infection and is stable. The patient remains hypertensive despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. His hemoglobin levels have dropped due to the discontinuation of his femoral line, but there is no evidence of active bleeding. The patient's electrolytes and volume status have been stable, and he had his last dialysis session on [**11-4**]. He is also being monitored for diabetes management. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension may lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or renal damage if not adequately controlled.
2. Enterococcus UTI: If not appropriately treated, the urinary tract infection could lead to sepsis or the spread of infection to other organs.
3. CKD: The underlying cause of hyperkalemia on presentation, chronic kidney disease can progress further and result in end-stage renal disease, requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation.
4. Hypoglycemia: Poor glycemic control in diabetic patients can result in hypoglycemic episodes, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.
