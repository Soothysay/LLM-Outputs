","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and splenectomy, who presents with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, worsening hypoxia, and mild abdominal tenderness. He was found to have GPCs in pairs on blood culture. The patient continues to be febrile, hypotensive, and hypoxic despite treatment with multiple antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin) and IVIG. He has an edematous gallbladder on RUQ ultrasound and a left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation with ARDS vent settings. His urine output has decreased significantly, and he is showing signs of renal dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening hypoxia suggests a possible severe infection or sepsis. The presence of GPCs in pairs on blood culture indicates a bacterial infection, most likely caused by gram-positive cocci. This infection could be secondary to his underlying immunocompromised state due to HIV.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient is showing signs of multiple organ dysfunction. His renal function is impaired, as evidenced by the decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels. He also has respiratory distress, requiring intubation and invasive ventilation. The edematous gallbl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with HIV and a history of splenectomy. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with high FiO2 and PEEP levels. He has been diagnosed with septic shock due to gram-positive cocci in the blood. The patient is also experiencing decreased urine output, acute kidney injury, and has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and fenofibrate use. He is receiving multiple pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, IVIG, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and drotrecogin (Xigris). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state (HIV) and the presence of indwelling lines and tubes.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and oliguria suggest AKI. This may require hemodialysis for management.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on high levels of FiO2 and PEEP, indicating respiratory distress. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient requires multiple"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and splenectomy. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. He has been febrile and hypotensive since admission, with the only localizing factor being mild abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, requiring multiple fluid boluses and four pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-65 overnight. He is now on the maximum dose of levophed, neosynephrine, vasopressin, and started on dopamine last night.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 104.5°F (40.3°C), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/56 mmHg to 201/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 100% FiO2 and PEEP increased overnight.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with white blood cell count ranging from 24.9 to 28.9 thousand/mm³, elevated blood glucose levels, increased creatinine levels from 2.4 to 3.5 mg/dL, and a decrease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, HIV, type II diabetes mellitus, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, and there is a risk of further complications or deterioration if the infection is not controlled.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are currently on ARDS vent settings. There is a risk of worsening lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation support.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to the need for dialysis.

4. HIV-related opportunistic infections: Given the patient's HIV status, there is a risk of developing opportunistic infections, which can worsen his overall condition.

5. Diabetes-related complications: The patient has type II diabetes, and poor glycemic control can increase the risk of complications such as infections, poor wound healing, and cardiovascular events.

6. Ineffective coping and psychosocial issues: The patient"

   Critical Care
   Remains profoundly ill. Temp down on CVVH. Precipitous drop in plt ct.
   Heme thinks this is poor production rather than DIC or meds.  No active
   bleeding. We have weaned pressors substantially, weaned FIO2 to 0.4.
   Still awaiting ID of GPC in blood. Na down
 will discuss with Renal
   how to manage Na with his bath.  Family aware of how sick he remains.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. The patient is critically ill and remains profoundly ill. The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. These potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and the need for a repeat chest X-ray to evaluate for loculated effusion that may be drainable.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 23, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause, and appropriate management should be initiated.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 4.7 and are currently at 3.9, indicating acute renal failure. The patient's urine output is also low at 85cc over 24 hours despite aggressive IV fluid boluses. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis (HD) or continuous veno-venous"

Xigris was held overnight due to a PTT of 150 and concern for bleeding. 

The patient is also experiencing acute respiratory failure and has been intubated. His FiO2 has been weaned down to 50%, and PEEP has been increased to 20 overnight. He no longer requires a paralytic. The last ABG showed a pH of 7.21, PaCO2 of 56, and PaO2 of 98. 

The patient has acute renal failure, with no history of kidney disease. His creatinine level peaked at 4.7 yesterday but has decreased to 3.9 this morning. His urine output is 85 cc over 24 hours despite aggressive IV fluid boluses. He has been placed on a renal HD line"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, HIV, type II diabetes mellitus, and ineffective coping.

The patient presented with fevers, rigors, and hypotension in the emergency department. He was found to have GPCs in pairs on blood culture, indicating a bacterial infection. The patient is currently febrile, hypotensive, and experiencing worsening renal failure. He also has a left pleural effusion seen on chest X-ray.

The patient's respiratory status is critical as he requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. His blood gases show a low oxygen saturation level of 92% on 100% FiO2 and PEEP increased to 20. The patient is sedated and paralyzed with versed, fentanyl, and cisatracurium.

The patient's urine output has significantly decreased, and his creatinine levels have worsened over time. He has made only 35 cc of urine since midnight. Renal consultation has been obtained for hemodialysis access and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

The patient also has type II diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin sliding scale coverage. He has hypercholesterolemia, for which he is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and ineffective coping.

The patient presented with fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He was initially treated with IVIG for concern of group A strep, but it was later discontinued as it may have contributed to his fevers. The patient also received antibiotics for suspected gram-positive cocci in blood infection.

The patient required multiple fluid boluses and pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 55-60 mmHg due to septic shock. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 and PEEP to improve oxygenation. The patient is sedated and paralyzed with cisatracurium.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with decreasing urine output and elevated creatinine levels. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with CVVH and plans for hemodialysis (HD) access have been made.

Other notable findings include hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy, hypercholesterolemia being managed with lipitor, and nutritional support through IV fluids.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening sepsis, further deterioration of renal function leading to acute kidney injury or end"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He has worsening renal failure and requires intensive care unit (ICU) support. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 20. He is receiving multiple pressors and intermittent fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 48.3 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 23. He has acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL and oliguria with urine output of 85 mL over 24 hours. The patient's HIV status is being managed by holding HAART therapy due to overwhelming septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening organ dysfunction indicates septic shock. This condition is life-threatening and requires immediate management with appropriate antibiotics, source control, and hemodynamic support.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of diffuse alveolar damage on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypox"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and other medical conditions. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He has worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, and other complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state (HIV) and recent hospitalization. This can lead to further sepsis or septic shock.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This may progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.

4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT and use of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of sepsis and potential coagulopathy.

5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient requires multiple pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. This puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial dysfunction.

6. HIV-related opportunistic infections: Due to the patient's immunos"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He has worsening renal failure and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, HIV/AIDS, type II diabetes mellitus, and a history of splenectomy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive organ dysfunction: The patient's condition is already severe, and there is a risk of further deterioration in organ function, particularly in the kidneys and lungs.

2. Infection: Despite being on multiple antibiotics, the patient still has a high white blood cell count and positive gram-positive cocci in pairs on sputum culture. There is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infection.

3. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT suggests a bleeding tendency, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to sepsis.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, and he may develop ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

5. Renal replacement therapy: The patient's urine output is low, and he has acute renal failure. He may require ongoing renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis or CVVH"

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin. However, the patient developed an allergic reaction to erythromycin base and Biaxin (clarithromycin), resulting in hives. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/53 mmHg to 143/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation. 

The patient is on several infusions, including midazolam (versed), vasopressin, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), norepinephrine, and potassium chloride (CRRT). 

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 10,000/mm3. The patient also has elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, which may suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the heme/oncology team believes that the low plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal
   failure.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing GPCs in
   pairs now with septic shock. Continues to be febrile to 103s. Patient
   now off of dopamine and phenylephrine, on lower dose of levophed and on
   vasopression, MAP holding in high 60
s.  Received one dose of IVIG on
   [**6-13**] for concern for group A strep.  Xigris held overnight [**3-18**] PTT of
   150, and concern for bleeding, continues to be held.
   -continue pressors and IV fluid bolus to maintain MAP>50
   -continue IV hydrocortisone 50g q 8 hours (day 1 = [**6-13**])
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci
   - Continue vancomycin and clindamycin.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   -continue CVVH
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Follow up BCx
   - Follow wbc curve, lactate
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], now tolerating FiO2 of 40% and PEEP at 20. Last ABG
   7.30/56/113
   -IP did not think that they would intervene on anything at the moment,
   though may take a look this AM for any loculated pleural effusions
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - wean vent as tolerated
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Plts 23 after repletion with 1 bag.  Heme onc thinks
   unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be marrow suppression from sepsis.
   Peripheral smear shows no schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab
   also sent, holding heparin and all medications that cause
   thrombocytopenia.  Replete if under 10K, no active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. Down to 2.5
   this AM.  On CVVH, held at even.   Also hyponatremic to 128 yesterday,
   stopped D5W with bicarbonate, now up to 132, renal was made aware.
   -follow up renal recs
   -redose medications, changed Vanc to 1250mg q24 hours
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   -holding HAART in the setting of overwhelming septic shock
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   cover with insulin sliding scale
   -lantus at 12u daily
   -goal blood sugars 150-200
 SPLENECTOMY
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   -social work consult
continue to eval
   .
   .
   #. FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, IVF as above. Will consider TFs
   vs. TPN in [**3-19**] days, depending on how patient recovers.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, HIV, type II diabetes mellitus, splenectomy, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially if the platelet count continues to drop or if there is any trauma or invasive procedures.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

5. HIV/AIDS: The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV infection,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with HIV and a history of splenectomy who presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He was diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, HIV, type II diabetes mellitus, and ineffective coping. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, and supportive care. His condition remains unstable with ongoing organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current diagnosis of severe sepsis indicates a serious systemic infection that can lead to multiple organ failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low, which increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. This may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
5. HIV/AIDS: The patient's underlying HIV/AIDS infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. He has been diagnosed with several medical complications including severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, HIV, type II diabetes mellitus, splenectomy, and ineffective coping.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. This can lead to further deterioration in organ function and increased risk of mortality if not properly managed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management. There is a risk of developing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) if not appropriately managed, which can result in significant lung dysfunction and difficulty in oxygenation.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the platelet count continues to decrease or if there are any additional factors contributing to platelet dysfunction.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicates a decline in kidney function. If left untreated or uncontrolled, this can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with severe sepsis, likely caused by Streptococcus bacteria. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on multiple medications including dopamine, vasopressin, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), midazolam, norepinephrine, and others. The patient's vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure, high heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 9.4 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) at 79%. The patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, resulting in a total fluid balance of 2,221 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory support indicates a possible development of ARDS, characterized by low oxygen levels and difficulty in breathing. This condition may require further interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent hemorrhagic"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with severe sepsis, likely caused by Streptococcus species. They are currently experiencing septic shock, requiring multiple vasopressors and other supportive measures. The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic derangements. They are also suffering from a massive volume overload, which requires CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-related complications: The patient's condition can worsen due to ongoing infection and septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. ARDS exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, resulting in worsening hypoxemia and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function may continue to deteriorate, necessitating ongoing renal replacement therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if invasive procedures are required.
5. Metabolic disturbances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders need close monitoring and correction to prevent further complications.
6. Fluid overload: The massive volume overload poses a risk of pulmonary edema and cardiac dysfunction.
7. Infection control: Preventing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections, is crucial in"

   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing GPCs in
   pairs now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off of
   dopamine and phenylephrine, weaning levaphed, also on vasopression,
   MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern for group
   A strep.  Also treated with xigris, now being held given
   thrombocytopenia.
   -continue pressors and IV fluid bolus to maintain MAP>50
   -continue IV hydrocortisone 50g q 8 hours (day 1 = [**6-13**])
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci
   - Continue vancomycin and clindamycin.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   -continue CVVH
   - Tylenol prns
   - Follow up BCx
   - Follow wbc curve, lactate
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Peep decreased to 16
   yesterday. . Last ABG 7.28/50/114
   -IP did not think that they would intervene on anything at the moment,
   though may take a look this AM for any loculated pleural effusions
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - wean vent as tolerated
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - f/u hit antibody
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH, held
   at even.
   -follow up renal recs
   -redose medications, changed Vanc to 1250mg q24 hours
   .
   # HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and multiple comorbidities. The patient presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He also has worsening renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated. This indicates difficulty in breathing and oxygenation, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient developed thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and may require platelet transfusion or other interventions.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which means the kidneys are not functioning properly. This can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.

5. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, which makes him immunocompromised and more susceptible to infections.

6. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has diabetes, and poor glycemic control can increase the risk of complications such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with HIV and a history of splenectomy. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He was diagnosed with severe sepsis and septic shock, likely caused by Streptococcus viridans. The patient required multiple pressors for hemodynamic support and is currently on vasopressin. He also received IVIG and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. His blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and he continues to be treated with vancomycin and clindamycin. He developed thrombocytopenia, which was thought to be due to sepsis-induced marrow suppression rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's platelet count has stabilized at 34,000/mm3.

The patient has acute renal failure, with a peak creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will be following up with renal recommendations.

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is being managed with insulin sliding scale. He has a history of splenectomy and is up to date on immunizations.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO and will be repleted with electrolytes"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of sepsis and respiratory failure. They have a history of allergies to certain antibiotics and have been receiving multiple infusions and medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. They are on mechanical ventilation with a high tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. The patient's condition is complicated by severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and metabolic disarray. There is also a concern for thrombocytopenia and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to an infection caused by Streptococcus viridans. This bacterial infection can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is a severe complication characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, leading to impaired gas exchange. It can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to ESRD, which requires urgent intervention such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVV"

   Keeping Map at 60-65, have taken off Neo, levophed has weaned
   significantly
   IV hydrocort Day [**5-21**]
   Vanco Clinda both effective  to S viridans
 plan for TEE in AM
   consulting cards
   2. ARDS: Improving oxygenation
 PEEP down to 16 and holdng his own.
   Recheck balloon pressures.  Could try to go down on his rate slightly
   though his still has a lot of dead space and needs sig minute
   ventilation so may not make a lot of progress yet
   3. ESRD and metabolic disarray massive volume overload - CVVH to run
   even, watch Na
   4. Thrombocytopenia DDX sepsis, DIC, meds: Tx for less than 10 K. Bump
   in plts from 15 to 30 this AM- will watch trend Follow up HIT, no

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has sepsis caused by Streptococcus viridans, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient also has evidence of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and ESRD (end-stage renal disease). There is a massive volume overload, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, progression of ARDS leading to further respiratory failure, worsening renal function, thromboembolic events, and potential complications related to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation. 

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, laboratory values, and response to treatment interventions. Timely management of the patient's various organ dysfunctions and complications is essential for their overall well-being."

   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   of dopamine and phenylephrine, weaning levaphed, also on vasopression,
   MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern for group
   A strep.  Also treated with xigris, now being held given
   thrombocytopenia.
   -continue to wean pressors as tolerated
   -continue IV hydrocortisone 50g q 8 hours (day 1 = [**6-13**])
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci
   - Continue vancomycin and clindamycin.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   -continue CVVH
   - Tylenol prns
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures
   - Follow wbc curve, lactate
   - Obtain TEE when stable to evaluate for endocarditis
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Peep decreased to 16
   yesterday. . Last ABG 7.28/50/114. Per IP no intervention for left
   pleural effusion at this time.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - wean vent as tolerated
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.  Stable over
   last 24 hours, platelets 34 this am.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - f/u hit antibody
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH, held
   at even.
   -follow up renal recs
   -redose medications, changed Vanc to 1250mg q24 hours
   .
   # HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   -holding HAART in the setting of overwhelming septic shock
   .
   # DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   cover with insulin sliding scale
   -lantus at 12u daily
   -goal blood sugars 150-200
   .
   # SPLENECTOMY. Patient up to date on immunizations.
   .
   #. FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, IVF as above. Will consider TFs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including HIV (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they still require vasopressor support. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormal values in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other markers. The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer, headache, hypotension, and ineffective coping. The plan includes nutrition support and management of various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcers, which can worsen due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
4. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient already has acute renal failure, and further complications could arise due to inadequate renal function.
5. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, and there is"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal
   failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off.
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci, culture
   shows sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora
   -Treated with  IV hydrocortisone 50g q 8 hours (day 1 = [**6-13**]), will d/c
   today
   - Vancomycin and clindamycin d/c
d per ID, pt started on gentamicin and
   pencillin
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - Follow wbc curve
   - Obtain TEE today to evaluate for endocarditis (TTE negative)
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Peep decreased to 16
   yesterday. Last ABG 7.28/50/114.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - CXR shows ? collapse of left lower lung/ opacification
   - PEEP recently decreased from 20 to 16, will reincrease to 20 in
   attempt to reexpand left lower lung
   - IP consult today to ultrasound to evaluate for left lower lung
   effusion
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.  Now trending
   up to 53.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - f/u hit antibody
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH.
   -per renal will continue CVVH for 24-48 hours to attempt volume
   removal, then will transition to HD.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. AST/ALT consistently elevated, however now with
   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Concern for obstruction alk phos/t.bili vs shock liver.
   - repeat RUQ u/s
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   -holding HAART in the setting of overwhelming septic shock
   .
   # DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   cover with insulin sliding scale
   -lantus at 12u daily
   -goal blood sugars 150-200
   .
   # SPLENECTOMY. Patient up to date on immunizations.
   .
   #. FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, IVF as above. Will consider TFs
   vs. TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and recent presentation with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, septic shock, and worsening renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with rigors, fevers, hypotension, and worsening renal failure, indicating sepsis. The initial BCx grew streptococcus viridans, and the patient received IVIG and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to acute respiratory failure. He was initially difficult to ventilate and required paralysis. Now he is tolerating FiO2 of 40% and PEEP 16.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion. The heme onc team believes it is likely due to marrow suppression from sepsis rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 4.7. He is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will"

   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures
   - Follow wbc curve
   - Obtain TEE today to evaluate for endocarditis (TTE negative)
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Peep decreased to 16
   yesterday. Last ABG 7.28/50/114.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - CXR shows ? collapse of left lower lung/ opacification
   - PEEP recently decreased from 20 to 16, will reincrease to 20 in
   attempt to reexpand left lower lung
   - IP consult today to ultrasound to evaluate for left lower lung
   effusion
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.  Now trending
   up to 53.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - f/u hit antibody
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH.
   -per renal will continue
   -redose medications, changed Vanc to 1250mg q24 hours

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented with acute onset fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. The patient required mechanical ventilation and multiple pressors for blood pressure support. He has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The patient also has a history of group A streptococcal infection and is being treated with antibiotics. He is currently on CVVH for renal support and has been weaned off vasopressin and levophed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 40%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has severe sepsis due to group A streptococcal infection. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential development of septic shock.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and the need for more aggressive ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal
   failure.

   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off.
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci, culture
   shows sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora
   - pt continues on gentamicin and pencillin

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - PEEP at 20, required more sedation
   - IP drained a transudative fluid, serous, from L. pleural space

   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.  Now trending

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and multiple comorbidities. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He required mechanical ventilation and was intubated. He also has worsening renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing sepsis due to a suspected group A streptococcus infection. He presented with rigors, fevers, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He received IVIG and antibiotics but still requires close monitoring and treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed acute respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He initially had difficulty tolerating ventilation and required paralysis. Now he is tolerating FiO2 of 40% but remains on ARDS vent settings.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion. The cause is likely marrow suppression from sepsis rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). HIT ab is negative, so heparin can be restarted if necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by a peak creatinine level of 4.7. He is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and suspected endocarditis. The patient is currently on multiple medications including sedation, antibiotics, insulin, and platelet transfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which indicates a severe infection affecting multiple organ systems. Continuous monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to ensure proper lung function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). Adequate fluid management and close monitoring of renal function are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which may be due to sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or marrow suppression. Platelet transfusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal
   failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off.
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci, culture
   shows sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora
   - pt continues on gentamicin and pencillin
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - Follow wbc curve
   - Obtain TEE today to evaluate for endocarditis (TTE negative), tube
   feeds being held
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Peep decreased to 16
   yesterday. Last ABG 7.28/50/114.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - CXR shows ? collapse of left lower lung/ opacification
   - PEEP at 20, required more sedation
   - IP drained a transudative fluid, serous, from L. pleural space
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.  HIT ab also sent, holding
   heparin and all medications that cause thrombocytopenia.  Now trending
   up to 53.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient was initially treated for suspected group A streptococcal infection with IVIG and antibiotics. However, subsequent tests revealed the presence of Streptococcus viridans, which caused septic shock. The patient required mechanical ventilation and pressors for blood pressure support.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with rigors and fevers, localized abdominal tenderness, and diarrhea. He was febrile and hypotensive in the emergency department. The initial blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, indicating a bacterial infection that led to septic shock. The patient received IVIG and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on [06/12] due to difficulty in ventilating. Initially, he required paralysis with cisatricuronium, high levels of FiO2, PEEP of 20, and a respiratory rate of 35. Currently, the patient is off paralysis and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. PEEP has been decreased to 16. The patient's most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.28, indicating respiratory acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with labored breathing and increased PEEP. They underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis, which revealed transudative pleural fluid. A TEE is scheduled for tomorrow, and tube feeds have been restarted. The patient's RUQ ultrasound showed a decrease in GB wall edema, no distention, no stones, and no cholecystitis. A small amount of free fluid was adjacent to the liver. The patient's Gentamicin level was 0.7, and they were given Gent per ID recommendations. The patient is negative for HIT antibodies. Bronchoscopic findings demonstrated the esophageal balloon in the lung, and it was extracted. The patient's platelet count is increasing. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP, indicating respiratory distress. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction. They are at risk of developing septic shock if the infection spreads or if their immune system becomes compromised.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require dialysis. Poor renal function can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may require close monitoring and intervention to maintain adequate blood pressure and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He presented with rigors, fevers, mild abdominal tenderness, and diarrhea. The patient required multiple pressors and was treated with IVIG and antibiotics for a suspected group A streptococcus infection. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no vegetations. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and is being treated with CVVH. He also has diabetes mellitus type II, is being held on HAART for his HIV, and has a history of splenectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including fevers, chills, and hypotension. He was treated with antibiotics but continues to have ongoing infections as indicated by positive blood cultures. There is a concern for septic shock and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He has been difficult to ventilate and required high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. The patient's ABG results show a low pH indicating respiratory acidosis. There is a concern for the development"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, renal failure, decubitus ulcer, ineffective coping, respiratory failure, acute sepsis with organ dysfunction, and alteration in nutrition. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The initial assessment revealed hypotension, elevated heart rate, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV mode. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The blood cultures were positive for gram-negative bacteria. 

The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and antivirals. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated due to the worsening renal function. 

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure. The respiratory support has been adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunctions. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, respiratory distress, septic shock, and the development of further decubitus ulcers due to prolonged immobility."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and ineffective coping. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/46 to 155/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.38, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 348, and lactic acid level of 1.2 mmol/L. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -5,634 mL. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube with Vivonex at 30 mL/hour. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, heparin sodium, and acyclovir. The patient's recent events include pancreatitis, negative transesophageal echocardiogram, hypotension, and initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's medical team is considering restarting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of respiratory failure, development of infections due to immunosuppression, and complications related to the decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic [**Numeric Identifier 281**] and worsening renal
   failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**]. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.
   - Sputum cx gram stain 1+ GPCs in pairs, 1+ GN diplococci, culture
   shows sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora
   - Continue gentamicin and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss with ID need for gentamicin
   given negative TEE,
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - Follow wbc curve
   .
   #LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence or oral HSV.
   - If signs of secondary infection, consider CT abd after off CVVH
   - follow wbc curve
   - Continue to monitor for sources of infection
   - D/w ID oral vs IV acyclovir for oral HSV
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. Now
   off paralytic and tolerating FiO2 of 40%. Minute ventilation
   decreasing. Last ABG 7.28/50/114. Thoracentesis by IP showed
   transudative fluid, amylase 35.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - PEEP at 20, required more sedation
   - IP drained a transudative fluid, serous, from L. pleural space
   .
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis with CVVH after 5+ L removed. Responded to fluid bolus and run
   at even for the remainder of the night.
   - Fluid bolus as necessary
   - Diuresis at goal of 400 cc/ hour negative
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.    Now trending up to 95.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**]. On CVVH. BPs
   did not tolerate goal of 500ccs/hour overnight.  CVVH run at even for
   remainder of night.
   - Continue CVVH goal to remove 400cc/hour today
   - Will transition to HD when adequate fluid removed.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. AST/ALT consistently elevated, however now with
   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Per liver concern for [**Month/Year (2) 281**] liver, vs. [**3-18**] sepsis,
   secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. Per pharm,
   unlikely related to any of his medications. Today alk phos increasing
   but t.bili decreased
   - per liver will check hepatitis serologies, EBV, CMV, and viral loads
   - trend LFTs
   - consider HIDA scan if persistent wbc, fevers
   .
   # HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   - holding HAART in setting of overwhelming septic [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss
   with ID time course to restart HAART
   .
   # DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics for suspected group A streptococcal infection but later found to be negative. He received IVIG and was placed on gentamicin, which was continued despite negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) results. The patient has been intubated since June 12th and required paralysis initially due to difficulty ventilating. His condition improved, and he was weaned off the paralytic medication. The patient developed hypotension while undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with significant fluid removal. He responded to a fluid bolus and ran at even for the remainder of the night. The patient also developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion, but it is trending upward. He has acute renal failure with no history of kidney disease, and his creatinine level peaked at 4.7 on June 13th. He is currently on CVVH with the goal to remove 400cc/hour today and transition to hemodialysis (HD) when adequate fluid removal is achieved. The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), particularly AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase, indicating possible liver involvement. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause,"

The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown value. They are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to erythromycin base, Biaxin (clarithromycin), ciprofloxacin, and an unknown reaction to clindamycin. They have received several medications including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), heparin sodium, and acyclovir. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/60 to 155/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pancreatitis, for which a CT abdomen is planned after discontinuing CVVH. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating possible pancreatic involvement. Other lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests, elevated D-dimer, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood culture and sensitivity panel has been sent, and they are being treated with acyclovir due to suspected viral infection.

   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**]. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.  Gentamicin d/c
d given TEE findings.
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence of oral HSV.  WBC trending
   down today to 38.  Afebrile overnight.
   - Continue penicillin for a total 10 day course
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - Repeat sputum culture
   - Follow wbc curve
   - If signs of secondary infection, consider CT abd after off CVVH
   - Continue to monitor for sources of infection
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35.
   Thoracentesis by IP showed transudative fluid. Now off paralytic and
   tolerating FiO2 of 40%. On [**6-19**] PEEP decreased to 16, last ABG
   7.39/38/170.  Levaquin started o/n for ? pneumonia, however overall
   chest x-rays appear to be improving, afebrile, and wbc trending down
   - will d/c levaquin
   - repeat sputum cx
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - Will continue to wean PEEP as tolerated
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis with CVVH after 5+ L removed on [**6-18**]. Responded to fluid bolus.
   Overnight able to tolerate CVVH with fluid removal. No repeat
   hypotension.
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.   Stable 75-100.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative

   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Per liver concern for [**Month/Year (2) 281**] liver, vs. [**3-18**] sepsis,
   secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. Per pharm,
   unlikely related to any of his medications. Today LFTs pending down.
   - hepatitis serologies, EBV, CMV, and viral loads pending

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and recent hospitalization for septicemia caused by Streptococcus viridans. He presents with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient's current medical conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead to sepsis or worsening of existing sepsis.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient is currently improving, there is a risk of developing ARDS due to the severity of his respiratory failure.

3. Organ Failure: The patient already has evidence of renal failure and may develop additional organ failures, such as hepatic or cardiovascular dysfunction.

4. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's immobilization and thrombocytopenia, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and positive viral hepatitis serologies indicate potential hepatic dysfunction, which requires further investigation and monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He was diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also experienced thrombocytopenia, which improved with platelet transfusion. The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and oral herpes simplex virus infection.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of fevers, chills, and hypotension suggests sepsis, which has already led to organ dysfunction.
2. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory failure and difficulty ventilating require careful monitoring and management to prevent further lung injury.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and platelet transfusion as needed are necessary.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction. CVVH is being used to remove fluid and toxins from the body.
5. Leukocytosis: The persistent high white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, renal failure, ineffective coping, respiratory failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to sepsis. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 380 mL, RR of 35, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 30 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O. The ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2 of 425, and a normal oxygen saturation of 100%.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The daily fluid balance shows a significant input-output discrepancy, indicating potential fluid overload.

3. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He has received multiple antibiotics including gentamicin, levofloxacin, acyclovir, and now on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Levofloxacin. The WBC count is"

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 108 bpm, blood pressure 118/77 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate set at 35 breaths per minute, and PEEP at 12 cmH2O. Fluid balance shows an input of 7044 mL and output of 7665 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 621 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 38.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation profile.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. 

The patient experienced two episodes of hypotension with a systolic blood pressure below 100, for which they received two 500cc boluses of fluid. The patient's temperature reached 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and they were given one dose each of zosyn and vancomycin. The patient is on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, indicating respiratory support. 

The patient has negative results for HCV and HBV viral loads. However, their creatinine level has increased to 2.1, suggesting a decline in kidney function. The patient tested positive for EBV IgG antibodies. 

The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, causing hives; Biaxin (clarithromycin), causing unknown reactions; and ciprofloxacin, leading to gum pain. 

The patient received various antibiotics, including gentamicin, levofloxacin, acyclovir, piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn), vancomycin, and penicillin G potassium. They are also receiving midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, current temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic [**Month/Day (4) 281**] and worsening renal
   failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)/ LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**]. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.  Gentamicin d/c
d given TEE findings.
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence of oral HSV.  WBC at 37.2,
   febrile to 101, pan cultured yesterday and empirically gave 1 dose of
   vanc and zosyn
   - Continue penicillin for a total 10 day course (Day [**7-24**])
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - F/U Pan culture form yesterday
   - Continue to monitor for sources of infection, f/u CT Torso scan.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35.
   Thoracentesis by IP showed transudative fluid.   Currently on FiO2 of
   40% with PEEP of 12.  Current ABG demonstrates increased pO2.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - Will wean PEEP to 10
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis in the past. Responded to fluid bolus. No repeat hypotension.
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.   Stable 75-100, currently above
   105.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**].  No longer on
   CVVH, net positive 300 cc yesterday, Cr to 2.8 from 2.1.  Likely a

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He was diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and leukocytosis. The initial treatment included IVIG and antibiotics for suspected group A streptococcus infection. However, subsequent tests showed no vegetations on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and the patient's sepsis improved, leading to discontinuation of gentamicin.

The patient developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He initially had difficulty ventilating and required paralysis with cisatricuronium, FiO2 of 100%, PEEP of 20, and RR of 35. Currently, he is on FiO2 of 40% with PEEP of 12, and his ABG demonstrates increased pO2.

The patient also experienced hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. He required platelet transfusion due to thrombocytopenia, and his Cr has improved from 2.1 to 2.8. The elevated LFTs are concerning for possible liver involvement, and further investigations are pending.

The patient's medical history includes HIV/AIDS, type II"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with acute onset fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and HIV. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient is also on CVVH for fluid removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension, which could indicate ongoing septic shock or complications from CVVH.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to the need for CVVH. There is a risk of further renal impairment or failure.
6. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible hepatic injury"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and HIV/AIDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has already experienced multiple infections, including sepsis caused by streptococcus viridans. There is a possibility of further infections due to his immunocompromised state (HIV/AIDS) and prolonged ICU stay.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure, which may progress to AKI if not managed properly. This could require ongoing hemodialysis and careful fluid and electrolyte management.

3. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications, such as atelectasis and pleural effusions.

4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to sepsis, viral hepatitis, or acalculous cholecystitis. Further evaluation and management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic [**Month/Day (4) 281**] and worsening renal
   failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)/ LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**]. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.  Gentamicin d/c
d given TEE findings.
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence of oral HSV.  WBC at 37.2 on
   [**6-21**], febrile to 101, pan cultured and empirically gave 1 dose of vanc
   and zosyn. This was discontinued overnight. WBC down to 21.6.  Tmax
   100.4.
   - Continue penicillin for a total 10 day course (Day [**8-23**])
   - Tylenol prn
   - Follow up BCx, surveillance cultures show no additional positive
   cultures after intial BCx.
   - Continue to monitor for sources of infection, f/u final read of CT
   Torso scan.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35.
   Thoracentesis by IP showed transudative fluid.   Currently on FiO2 of
   40% with PEEP of 10.  Current ABG demonstrates increased pO2.
   - on ARDS vent settings
   - Will wean PEEP to 10
   .
   # HCT drop:
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis in the past. Responds to fluid bolus. No further hypotension.
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: resolving.  Developed thrombocytopenia requiring
   platelet transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely
   to be marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.   Stable 75-100, currently 230.
   - Replete if under 10K or active bleeding
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**].  No longer on
   CVVH, net positive 1L overnight, Cr to 3.0 from 2.8.  Likely a
   combination of ATN from septic [**Month/Year (2) 281**] and aggressive diuresis. Tolerated
   HD well yesterday.
   - Continue HD, per renal recommendations
   - F/u renal recs
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. AST/ALT consistently elevated, however now with
   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Per liver concern for [**Month/Year (2) 281**] liver, vs. [**3-18**] sepsis,
   secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. Per pharm,
   unlikely related to any of his medications. Today LFTs trending down
   yesterday. CT torso shows mild pancreatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies, EBV Abs pending, CMV negative, viral loads

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and may require platelet transfusion.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity of drugs, and difficulty in managing other medical conditions.
5. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could include sepsis, viral infection, or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing fever, chills, and has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, splenectomy, and ineffective coping. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/50 to 145/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (levofloxacin, acyclovir, piperacillin/tazobactam, penicillin G potassium, vancomycin), sedatives (midazolam), pain medication (fentanyl), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with a tube in place, no murmurs heard, decreased breath sounds on the left base, and no abdominal distention. The patient also has petechiae on both feet. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies indicate findings consistent with mild pancreatitis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and patchy opacity in the left upper lobe."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. The source of infection appears to be related to Streptococcus viridans, a type of bacteria commonly associated with endocarditis.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis has led to organ dysfunction, as indicated by abnormal laboratory values and impaired organ function. This can include kidney failure (renal failure), liver dysfunction (elevated liver enzymes), and respiratory failure (requiring mechanical ventilation).

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which necessitates mechanical ventilation. There is an ongoing attempt to wean PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to improve respiratory function.

4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, which is currently being managed with appropriate medications.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, requiring dialysis to support kidney function.

6. Fever: The patient continues to have episodes of fever, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response or potential infection.

7. Abdominal issues: The patient's abdominal examination reveals signs of obesity and the presence of bowel sounds. There are no specific findings of abdominal pain or tenderness.

8. Cardiovascular system: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. He presented with rigors and fevers, localized abdominal tenderness, and progressing hypoxia. He was febrile and hypotensive in the emergency department. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. The patient initially required four pressors but is now off pressors with improved mean arterial pressure (MAP). He received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) due to concern for group A streptococcus infection and was treated with Xigris, which was later discontinued. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) showed no vegetations. Gentamicin was discontinued due to TEE findings. The patient has persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators of improving sepsis. Labs showed elevated amylase and lipase, concerning for pancreatitis. Oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) was identified. The patient was empirically given one dose of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, which were discontinued overnight. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has decreased from 37.2 to 17.4 thousand cells/microliter. His temperature is now at 101 degrees Fahrenheit.

   Disposition : ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and worsening renal failure. He has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), HCT drop, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), elevated LFTs, diabetes mellitus type II, and splenectomy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and worsening lung function if not monitored and managed appropriately.
3. HCT drop: The patient's hematocrit has dropped since admission. Potential etiologies include GI bleed, hemolysis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive in the setting of aggressive diuresis. There is a risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoperfusion if not promptly treated with fluids or vasopressors.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion. It is important to monitor the platelet count and provide appropriate transfusion support if needed.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of septic shock and aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of renal function and management are necessary.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, such as viral hepatitis or acalculous cholecystitis.
8. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's blood sugars are elevated, and insulin therapy will be required for glycemic control.
9. Splenectomy: The patient has a history of splenectomy, which increases the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). Vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics may be recommended.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, renal failure, respiratory failure, anxiety, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his critical condition.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/57 mmHg to 126/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 486 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 72.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 37.2 K/uL and platelet count (Plt) of 489 K/uL, indicating possible infection or inflammation. His renal function tests indicate worsening renal function with rising creatinine levels from 2.8 to 5.3 mg/dL. Liver function tests are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L, low magnesium (Mg++) of 1.7 mg/dL, and normal sodium (Na+) of 138 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer, anxiety, alteration in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and severe sepsis. He is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, and others. The plan includes making the patient NPO for possible tunneled cath HD line placement, holding heparin, and continuing with ongoing management and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, infection (due to immunosuppression and prolonged ICU stay), and further deterioration in the patient's overall condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and HIV.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on ventilator support. The ABG results indicate a normal pH, low pCO2, and low bicarbonate level. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 4.7. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis and may receive a tunneled catheter for ongoing renal support. Monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is resolving. He has received platelet transfusion and requires ongoing monitoring of platelet count. A low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding.

4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, particularly in the setting of aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with HIV, history of splenectomy, who presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, hematocrit drop, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Persistent infection or sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV, making him more susceptible to infections. The presence of sepsis indicates a serious infection that can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's organs, particularly the kidneys and liver, are showing signs of dysfunction. This can lead to long-term damage and failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Hematocrit drop: The patient's hematocrit levels have been decreasing, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed low platelet counts, which can increase the"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the 24-hour events, the patient required restarting HAART (likely antiretroviral therapy), which was deferred until tomorrow. The patient also needed hemodialysis (HD). They were given haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and sedated with propofol as they were grabbing at the endotracheal tube. The patient experienced desaturation when turned, requiring an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 5 to 8 cmH2O and an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 40% to 50%.

The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, hives from Biaxin (clarithromycin), unknown hives from ciprofloxacin, and gum pain from ciprofloxacin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were acyclovir on June 24th at 8:00 AM and penicillin G potassium on June 25th at 4:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 100 mcg/kg/min. They are also on midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl. Heparin sodium is being given as prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance,"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)/ LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.  Gentamicin d/c
d given TEE findings.
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence of oral HSV.  WBC at 37.2 on
   [**6-21**], febrile to 101, pan cultured and empirically gave 1 dose of vanc
   and zosyn. This was discontinued overnight. WBC continues to trend
   down, now 6.0.  Afebrile o/n.
   - D/c penicillin today as completed 10 day course
   - Tylenol prn
   - F/U BCx, tip Cx
   - D/w ID d/cing acyclovir as now day 8 for oral HSV
   - Consider removing CVL when pIVs obtained
   - Continue to monitor for sources of secondary infection
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35.
   Thoracentesis by IP showed transudative fluid.   Settings increased to
   FiO2 of 50% with PEEP of 8, PS 16.  Current ABG 7.41/40/99.
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   # HCT drop: Hct trend-> 24.5-> 26 to 23.4 today, has dropped since
   admission. Potential etiologies include GI bleed vs. hemolysis vs.
   DIC.  Hemolysis labs LDH 289, haptoglobin 233.
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT checks. Transfuse to keep HCT > 21
   -guaiac stools
   -continue carafate/PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
   -hold heparin SQ
   .
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis in the past. Responds to fluid bolus. No further hypotension.
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.   Now resolved. Currently 525.
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Cr peaked at 4.7 on [**6-13**].  No longer on
   CVVH, UOP increasing 2.2 L urine yesterday, Cr to 6.1 today. K 5.1.
   Likely a combination of ATN from septic shock and aggressive diuresis.
   Tolerated HD well on Friday.
   - Per renal will held off on tunneled catheter for now
   - Continue to monitor UOP, Cr, and K
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. AST/ALT consistently elevated, however now with
   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Per liver concern for shock liver, vs. [**3-18**] sepsis,
   secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. Per pharm,
   unlikely related to any of his medications. LFTs continue to trend
   down. CT torso shows mild pancreatitis.
   - Hep B surface and core AB positive, Hep C Ab neg, EBV IgM negative,
   CMV negative, viral loads negative
   - continue to trend LFTs

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and multiple medical conditions. The patient presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock, leading to renal failure. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and has been intubated since June 12th. There are concerns regarding HCT drop, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of splenectomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis and septic shock, which indicates a severe infection that can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 and PEEP will be important to monitor.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to septic shock and aggressive diuresis. Monitoring urine output, creatinine levels, and potassium levels is crucial.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient developed thrombocytopenia, requiring platelet transfusion. It was likely due to marrow suppression from sepsis. Monitoring platelet levels is essential.
5. Hepatic involvement: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of renal failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, splenectomy, and anxiety. He also has altered nutrition and impaired skin integrity with a decubitus ulcer. The patient's respiratory status is being supported with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, and his oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube. The patient's FiO2 is set at 40% and PEEP is at 8 cmH2O. His heart rate is 75 bpm, blood pressure is 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's temperature is currently 36.3 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature recorded was 37.3 degrees Celsius.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,417 mL, including 795 mL of IV fluids and 1,906 mL of IV fluids since midnight. The total output is 2,955 mL, consisting of 1,750 mL of urine output. The patient's NG output is -538 mL, stool output is -954 mL, and drain output is not assessed. The patient's blood products input and output are 2,417 mL and 2,955 mL respectively.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, sodium of 148 mg/dL, potassium of 5.8 mEq/L, chloride of 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 22.7%, BUN of 75 mg/dL, creatinine of 6.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 148 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR of 14.8/27.5/1.3, ALT/AST of 37/26, Alk Phos/T Bili of 234/0.6, amylase/lipase of 231/202, D-dimer of [**Numeric Identifier 7265**] ng/mL, fibrinogen of 424 mg/dL, lactic acid of 0.7 mmol/L, albumin of 2.5 g/dL, LDH of 207 IU/L, calcium of 7.9 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.4 mg/dL, and phosphate of 8.9 mg/dL.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and potential infections due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged use of invasive lines. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and lab results to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure.
   # SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)/ LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Pt presented with rigors and fevers, only localizing factor was mild
   abdominal tenderness and diarrhea, as well as progressing hypoxia. Was
   febrile and hypotension in ED. [**3-18**] BCx ([**6-12**] 1 am) growing strep
   viridans now with septic shock. Initially required 4 pressors, now off
   pressors, MAPs improved.  Received one dose of IVIG on [**6-13**] for concern
   for group A strep.  Also initially treated with xigris, now off. TEE
   [**6-18**] showed no vegetations.  Gentamicin d/c
d given TEE findings.
   Patient with persistent leukocytosis despite other indicators sepsis is
   improving. Labs [**6-18**] showed elevated amylase and lipase concerning for
   pancreatitis. Patient also with evidence of oral HSV.  WBC at 37.2 on
   [**6-21**], febrile to 101, pan cultured and empirically gave 1 dose of vanc
   and zosyn. This was discontinued overnight. WBC continues to trend
   down, now 6.0.  Afebrile o/n.
   - [**6-26**] = Day [**1-27**] of pencillin
   - Tylenol prn
   - F/U BCx, tip Cx
   - will d/c acyclovir for oral HSV after dosing today
   - Consider removing CVL when pIVs obtained
   - Continue to monitor for sources of secondary infection
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Intubated [**6-12**], was initially difficult to ventilate and required
   paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35.
   Thoracentesis by IP showed transudative fluid.   Settings increased to
   FiO2 of 40% with PEEP of 8, PS 14.  Current ABG 7.41/40/99.
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   # HCT drop: Hct trend-> 22.7 from 23.4 today, has dropped since
   admission. Potential etiologies include GI bleed vs. hemolysis vs.
   DIC.  Hemolysis unlikely as labs LDH 289, haptoglobin 233.
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT checks. Transfuse to keep HCT > 21
   -guaiac stools
   -continue carafate/PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
   -holding heparin SQ
   .
   #HYPOTENSION. Patient with hypotension in setting of aggressive
   diuresis in the past. Responds to fluid bolus. No further hypotension.
   .
   #THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Developed thrombocytopenia requiring platelet
   transfusion.  Heme onc thinks unlikely to be DIC, more likely to be
   marrow suppression from sepsis.  Peripheral smear shows no
   schistocytes, d-dimer, FDP increased.   Now resolved. Currently 625
   - Continue to monitor plts
   - HIT Ab negative
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   No history of kidney disease. Had acute renal failure with anuria and
   Creatinine to 4.7 requiring CVVH. Now renal function appears to be
   recovering, off CVVH, UOP increasing 2.3 L urine yesterday, Cr
   continues to climb, 6.5 from 6.1 today. K to 5.8 with PM labs yesterday
   (given kayexlate), now 5.3.  Last HD [**6-21**].
   - Per renal holding on dialysis, will follow renal recs
   - Continue to monitor UOP, electrolytes
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. AST/ALT consistently elevated, however now with
   elevated alk phos and t bili. Initial RUQ u/s showed edematous
   gallbladder. Per liver concern for shock liver, vs. [**3-18**] sepsis,
   secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. Per pharm,
   unlikely related to any of his medications. LFTs continue to trend
   down. CT torso shows mild pancreatitis.
   - Hep B surface and core AB positive, Hep C Ab neg, EBV IgM negative,
   CMV negative, viral loads negative
   .
   # HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure. The patient was intubated on [**6-12**] due to respiratory failure. He required aggressive diuresis, leading to hypotension. The patient also developed thrombocytopenia, which resolved after platelet transfusion. He had acute renal failure with anuria and a creatinine level of 4.7, requiring CVVH. Now, his renal function appears to be recovering, with an increasing urine output and decreasing creatinine level.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated amylase and lipase levels, concerning for pancreatitis. He has evidence of oral HSV infection and was empirically given vancomycin and zosyn, which were later discontinued. His white blood cell count is leukocytosis, but trending down. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 23.4 to 22.7, potentially due to GI bleed, hemolysis, or DIC. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause.

The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but trending down. There is concern for shock liver, secondary viral infection, or acalculous cholecystitis. A CT scan showed mild pancreatitis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation initially but is now weaning off the ventilator. He also has acute renal failure, pancreatitis, and evidence of oral herpes simplex virus infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient presented with fevers, chills, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The presence of streptococcus viridans in blood cultures suggests a bacterial infection as the underlying cause of sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He initially had difficulty ventilating and required paralysis with cisatricuronium. However, he is now being weaned off the ventilator.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient developed acute renal failure with anuria and elevated creatinine levels. He required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but appears to be recovering, as indicated by increasing urine output and decreasing creatinine levels.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels indicate acute pancreatitis. A CT scan showed mild pancreatitis.

5. Oral HSV Infection: The patient has evidence of oral herpes simplex virus infection.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure. The patient was initially treated for streptococcus infection but later tested negative. He also had evidence of oral HSV and elevated amylase and lipase levels suggesting pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated and being weaned off mechanical ventilation, with ABG values indicating improvement. His renal function has improved, but he still requires close monitoring. Other medical conditions mentioned include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, HCT drop, mental status changes, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, diabetes mellitus type II, and splenectomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that can occur in patients on mechanical ventilation.

2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line, CVL, and midline catheter. There is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection due to these lines.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of pneumatic boots may reduce the risk of D"

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, and acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, septic shock, and renal failure. He presented with rigors and fevers, mild abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, and progressing hypoxia. The patient required multiple pressors, IVIG for group A strep concern, and was initially treated with Xigris. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no vegetations, and labs indicated elevated amylase and lipase concerning for pancreatitis. The patient also had evidence of oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) post acyclovir treatment and resolved leukocytosis. 

The patient was intubated on [**6-12**] due to respiratory failure, initially difficult to ventilate, and required paralysis with cisatricuronium and FiO2s of 100, PEEP 20, RR of 35. He attempted to wean PS resulting in elevated minute ventilation and patient discomfort. 

The patient had acute renal failure with anuria and creatinine to 4.7 requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Now renal function appears to be recovering, off CVVH, UOP increasing 3.4 L yesterday, Cr stable between 6.0-6.5.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and HIV/AIDS. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with rigors, fevers, and hypotension, progressing to septic shock. He required pressors for hemodynamic support and was treated with IVIG for concern for group A strep infection. However, subsequent TEE showed no vegetations, and the patient remains afebrile.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on day 13 due to acute respiratory failure. Initial ventilation settings required FiO2 of 100, PEEP 20, and RR of 35. Weaning attempts resulted in elevated minute ventilation and patient discomfort.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient developed acute renal failure with anuria and creatinine levels of 4.7, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Renal function appears to be recovering, as the patient is off CVVH, with increasing urine output and stable creatinine levels.

   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure.
   # Sepsis: Strep viridans on penicillin d 15/24. Also oral HSV s/p
   acyclovir rx. Stable.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Attributed to vol overload and abdominal
   girth.  Doing well on pressure support and likely extubation today.
   - SBT, ABGs,  extubate
   # ARF: Unclear etiology for acute failure, likely ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis. Now, Cre stable in the setting of autodiuresis.  K
   stable and within normal level.
   - continue to monitor while autodiuresis
   - consider HD if worsened RF and anuria.
   # Anemia: Possibly renal failure/epo related. Hct  continues to be
   stable today at 23.
   - monitor
   # Hypovolemic hypernatremia: increase free water in TF.
   # HIV:
   - hold HAART until renal function improves
   - f/u ID and renal recs
   # DMII: Goal blood sugars 150-200.
   - decrease lantus to 8 units

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HIV and splenectomy. He presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock, resulting in renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus viridans and is responding well to penicillin therapy. The source of infection could be related to dental procedures.

2. Acute respiratory failure: Initially attributed to fluid overload and abdominal girth, the patient is now stable on pressure support ventilation and may be extubated soon.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The cause of acute renal failure is unclear, but it is likely to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and sepsis. The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and he is experiencing autodiuresis (increased urine output).

4. Anemia: This could be due to renal failure or epo-related issues. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is stable at 23%.

5. Hypovolemic hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level due to fluid loss. Free water should be increased through total parenteral nutrition (TF).

6. HIV: The patient's HAART therapy should be withheld until renal function improves. Follow-up with infectious disease and renal"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events include autodiuresis, decreased Lantus, and doing well with decreased PS. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, hives with Biaxin (oral clarithromycin), unknown hives with ciprofloxacin, and gum pain. The last dose of antibiotics was acyclovir on 06/26/2148 at 07:40 AM and penicillin G potassium on 06/29/2148 at 04:12 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl (concentrate) at 125 mcg/hour and midazolam (versed) at 3 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include Lansoprazole (prevacid) on 06/28/2148 at 07:49 AM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on 06/28/2148 at 07:49 AM, and midazolam (versed) on 06/28/2148 at 07:42 PM. Additionally, the patient is taking other medications.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data as of 06/29/2148 at 07:02 AM shows vital signs including temperature (Tmax: 37.4°C; Tcurrent: 37.4°C), heart rate (HR: 86 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 122/59 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 94%). The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance reveals a total intake of 1,732 mL, with 677 mL given through the PO, 393 mL through TF, and 1,059 mL through IVF. Total output includes 3,955 mL of blood products, 1,090 mL of urine, 1,000 mL of NG, and 413 mL of drains. The overall balance is -2,223 mL.

Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is 473 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 148, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and the patient's oxygenation status is indicated by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support.
- The patient has a history of allergies to erythromycin, Biaxin, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin G potassium.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, Lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and others.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/48 to 144/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient has received a total fluid input of 2,181 mL, with an output of 3,930 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of -1,749 mL.
- The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on mechanical ventilation mode PSV/SBT with a tidal volume of 332 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 185 mmHg, and respiratory rate (Ve) of 8.4 L/min.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with HIV, history of splenectomy, who presented with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, and septic shock. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, hypovolemic hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII).

The patient was successfully extubated and is oxygenating well. His sepsis is being treated with penicillin and acyclovir for oral HSV. The etiology of ARF is unclear but is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension/sepsis. His creatinine levels are trending down with autodiuresis, and his potassium levels are stable and within normal range. Monitoring and considering hemodialysis (HD) if there is worsening renal function and anuria will be continued.

The patient has anemia, possibly related to renal failure or epo-related. Monitoring of Hct levels will be done, and no active intervention is required at this time.

The patient also has hypovolemic hypernatremia, and free water will continue to be administered through the TF.

Regarding his medical history, the patient has HIV and will hold HAART until renal function improves. Follow-up with ID and renal recommendations will be done. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo man with HIV, h/o splenectomy, presents with acute onset of
   fevers, chills, hypotension, now with septic shock and renal failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated successfully [**6-29**].  Oxygenating well
   on nasal cannula.
   # Sepsis: Strep viridans on penicillin d 19/28.
   # ARF: Unclear etiology for acute failure, likely ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis. Now, Cre trending down in the setting of
   autodiuresis.  K stable and within normal level.
   - continue to monitor creatinine during autodiuresis
   - consider HD if worsened RF and anuria.
   # Anemia: Possibly renal failure/epo related. Hct  continues to be
   stable today at 23.
   - monitor
   # Hypovolemic hypernatremia: Taking in some PO, for now continue  free
   water in TF.
   # HIV:
   - hold HAART until renal function improves
   - f/u ID and renal recs
   # DMII: Goal blood sugars 150-200.
   - lantus at 8 units, consider further decrease as needed

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, splenectomy, presenting with acute onset of fevers, chills, hypotension, septic shock, and renal failure. The patient has been successfully extubated and is currently oxygenating well on a nasal cannula.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and required mechanical ventilation. Although he has been successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to weakened lung function or infection.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by Streptococcus viridans, which is a type of bacteria commonly found in the mouth and throat. It is important to continue monitoring and treating the infection to prevent further complications.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and sepsis. The creatinine levels are trending down with autodiuresis, but close monitoring is necessary. If the renal function worsens and the patient becomes anuric (producing little to no urine), hemodialysis (HD) may be considered.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is stable at around 23%. This could be related to renal failure or epo-related issues. Continuous monitoring is required"
