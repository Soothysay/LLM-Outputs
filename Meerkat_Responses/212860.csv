   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, bipolar disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with a hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: The patient's high blood pressure requires immediate management to prevent further organ damage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation. There is an asymmetric infiltrate on the chest X-ray, which may indicate pulmonary edema or an infection.

3. ESRD on HD: The patient's chronic kidney disease requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis sessions, medication adjustments, and monitoring electrolyte imbalances.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient may have elevated potassium levels due to her renal disease, which needs to be treated promptly to avoid cardiac complications.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high cholesterol levels, and it is important to continue lipid-lowering therapy.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid hormone levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately.

7. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and her outpatient regimen should be continued.

8. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has bipolar disorder, and her psychiatric medication regimen should be continued. Involvement of the psychiatric team is recommended once the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4883**] is a 75yo female with ESRD on HD, bipolar disease,
   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Shock.  Likely septic in setting of leukocytosis, fevers,
   hypotension, elevated lactate.  Given appearance of CXR and sputum gram
   stain feel that most likely source is lungs, although does have
   bacteria in urine.
   -Cover broadly for aspiration/MRSA pneumonia with
   cipro/flagyl/vanc
should also cover any potential line/HD associated
   infection or UTI.  Only prior culture data from this hospital has been
   pan sensitive e. coli in urine.
   -follow up stool, blood, urine and sputum  cultures.  Re-culture if
   spikes.
   -wean levo as tolerated
   -follow up random cortisol
   -monitor CVPs
   -minimize fluids
   .
   # Respiratory failure: pt intubated due to increased work of
   breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  Plan was to extubate after
   dialysis, failed SBT, was apneic even while off sedation.  Likely in
   setting of fevers/sepsis. Now has gotten back almost all fluid removed
   at HD during rescusitation.  Unlikely will be able to wean until after
   HD on Monday
   -minimize add
l fluids
   -monitor ABGs, this am was alkalotic in setting of over breathing. Have
   increased sedation and decreased set rate, follow up repeat ECG.  Wean
   settings as tolerated
   -continue treating for probable pneumonia, consider bronch if
   decompensates.
   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications
   - HD per renal
   - Hyperkalemia improved after HD yesterday, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #HTN. Initially presented with hypertensive emergency after missing
   dialysis, was treated effectively with nitro gtt to temporize her for
   dialysis. In setting of probably evolving sepsis, pt unable to tolerate
   planned fluid removal of 4L with resultant hypotension.
   -hold anytihypertensives while on pressors.
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism. She presented with a hypertensive emergency and respiratory failure after missing multiple dialysis sessions. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to increased work of breathing. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia, as indicated by fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, elevated lactate, and findings on chest X-ray and sputum gram stain.

The patient has several comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and asthma. She is also on outpatient psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder.

In the ICU, the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for aspiration/MRSA pneumonia, as well as potential line/HD-associated infection or urinary tract infection. Blood, urine, stool, and sputum cultures have been ordered, and re-culture will be done if there are any spikes in parameters.

The patient's respiratory failure is managed with mechanical ventilation, and weaning will depend on the resolution of sepsis. Sedation and ventilator settings are being adjusted as tolerated. Fluid management is crucial, with efforts to minimize add fluids and monitor central venous pressures.

The patient's ESRD on HD requires continued renal dosing medications, Sevelamer, and scheduled hemodialysis sessions. Hyperkalemia"

   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: suspect that this is primarily due to
   pt being vol overloaded.
   - needs HD
   - tx w/ anti-HTN PRN; have pushed labetolol & given nitro gtt w/ good
   effect, however, holding further tx as BP trended down w/ sedation
   .
   # Respiratory failure: pt intubated due to increased work of
   breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  C02 not appropriate.
   - attempt to wean vent after HD
   - CXR shows asymmetric infiltrate
pulm edema vs infiltrate
   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications
   - HD per renal
   - tx hyperkalemia w/ calcium, insulin, glucose
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl.
   .
   #Asthma: Continue outpatient regimen
   .
   #Psych: Continue outpatient regimen.  Involve psych once pt extubated
   .
   #FEN: cardiac diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   #Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   #Code: presumed FULL  -- pt has ok'd intubation

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4883**] is a 75yo female with ESRD on HD, bipolar disease,
   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Shock.  Likely septic in setting of leukocytosis, fevers,
   hypotension, elevated lactate.  Given appearance of CXR and sputum gram
   stain feel that most likely source is lungs, although does have
   bacteria in urine.
   -Cover broadly for aspiration/MRSA pneumonia with
   cipro/flagyl/vanc
should also cover any potential line/HD associated
   infection or UTI.  Only prior culture data from this hospital has been
   pan sensitive e. coli in urine.
   -follow up stool, blood, urine and sputum  cultures.  Re-culture if
   spikes.
   -wean levo as tolerated
   -follow up random cortisol
   -monitor CVPs
   -minimize fluids
   .
   # Respiratory failure: pt intubated due to increased work of
   breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  Plan was to extubate after
   dialysis failed as she was apneic even while off sedation.  Now e/o
   PNA, sputum growing GPCs
strep pneumo on prelim.  Likely HAP, rather
   than VAP as pt was febrile & had WBC before 48hr of being on vent.
   -minimize add
l fluids
   -monitor ABGs, this am was alkalotic in setting of over breathing. Have
   increased sedation and decreased set rate, follow up repeat ECG.  Wean
   settings as tolerated
   -continue treating for probable pneumonia, consider bronch if
   decompensates.
   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications
   - HD per renal
   - Hyperkalemia improved after HD yesterday, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #HTN. Initially presented with hypertensive emergency after missing
   dialysis, was treated effectively with nitro gtt to temporize her for
   dialysis. In setting of probably evolving sepsis, pt unable to tolerate
   planned fluid removal of 4L with resultant hypotension.
   -hold anytihypertensives while on pressors.
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl.
   .
   #Asthma: Continue outpatient regimen
   .
   #Psych: Continue outpatient regimen.  Involve psych once pt extubated,
   the are following along.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/48 to 138/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal ventilation.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates a fluid balance of 2,093 mL in and 293 mL out, with a total input of 2,171 mL and total output of 78 mL. The patient's weight is currently 85.9 kg, down from the admission weight of 88.8 kg.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, PaO2 of 600, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 8.2 L/min.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to being intubated. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab results are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support with Nutren 2.0, glycemic control, central venous and arterial lines for monitoring, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and positive sputum culture suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates a potential renal dysfunction, which may be due to factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical progress to identify and manage any potential complications promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4883**] is a 75yo female with ESRD on HD, bipolar disease,
   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Shock.  Resolving.  Currently off of pressors.  Was likely septic in
   setting of leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, elevated lactate.  Given
   appearance of CXR and sputum gram stain feel that most likely source is
   lungs (RML).  Sputum w/ strep pneumo growing.  Random cortisol was 30.
   - Narrow abx coverage to tx strep pneumo (vanc/ctx + azithro, in case
   there is also atypical)
   -follow up stool, blood, urine and sputum  cultures.  Re-culture if
   spikes.
   -monitor CVPs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: pt intubated due to increased work of
   breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  Plan was to extubate after
   dialysis as it was initially thought that resp distress was primarily
   due to excess volume.  However, this failed as she was apneic even
   while off sedation.  CXR, leukocytosis & fever all suggest superimposed
   PNA.  Sputum from admission growing strep pneumo.  Likely HAP (as pt
   regularly at HD, rather than VAP as pt was febrile & had WBC before
   48hr of being on vent).  CXR improving s/p HD & abx.  Family reports
   that she had been coughing before presentation & wondered if she might
   have a PNA.
   -Try on Pressure support as pt is more awake & following commands.
   Monitor ABGs.  Try SBT today/early AM tomorrow depending on how she
   does on PS.
   -continue abx for strep pneumo pneumonia
   # Anemia: acute drop since admission from 32
22.  No e/o of gross
   bleeding.
   - check hemolysis labs
   - guaiac stool
   - repeat PM hct & transfuse if con
t to drop
   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications
   - HD per renal
   .
   #HTN. Initially presented with hypertensive emergency after missing
   dialysis, was treated effectively with nitro gtt to temporize her for
   dialysis. In setting of probably evolving sepsis, pt unable to tolerate
   planned fluid removal of 4L with resultant hypotension.  Pt currently
   nml BP off all agents.
   -hold anytihypertensives while on pressors.
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl.
   .
   #Asthma: Continue outpatient regimen
   .
   #Psych: Continue outpatient regimen.  Involve psych once pt extubated,
   the are following along.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism. She presented with hypertensive emergency and respiratory failure after missing multiple dialysis sessions. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing and apnea. She has a history of leukocytosis, fever, and elevated lactate, suggesting sepsis. The most likely source of infection is the lungs, with Streptococcus pneumoniae growing in her sputum. The patient's random cortisol level is low at 30. She has a history of anemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, asthma, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, fever, and elevated lactate. The source of infection appears to be the lungs, where Streptococcus pneumoniae is growing. This can lead to sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She had increased work of breathing and was apneic even while off sedation. Monitoring ABGs and conducting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will help assess her progress.
3. Anemia: The patient experienced an acute drop in hemoglobin from 32 to 22. No"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4883**] is a 75yo female with ESRD on HD, bipolar disease,
   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Shock.  Resolved.  Off of pressors >24hr.  Was likely septic in
   setting of leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, elevated lactate.  Random
   cortisol was 30.Given appearance of CXR and sputum gram stain feel that
   most likely source is lungs (RML).  Sputum w/ strep pneumo growing.
   - Con
t narrowed abx coverage to tx strep pneumo (vanc/ctx + azithro,
   in case there is also atypical)
   -follow up stool, blood, urine and sputum  cultures.  Re-culture if
   spikes.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: successfully extubated.  Was initially intubated
   due to increased work of breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  Plan
   was to extubate after dialysis as it was initially thought that resp
   distress was primarily due to excess volume.  However, this failed as
   she was apneic even while off sedation.  CXR, leukocytosis & fever all
   suggest superimposed PNA on top of fluid.  Sputum from admission
   growing strep pneumo.  Likely HAP (as pt regularly at HD, rather than
   VAP as pt was febrile & had WBC before 48hr of being on vent).  CXR
   improving s/p HD & abx.  Family reports that she had been coughing
   before presentation & wondered if she might have a PNA.
    -continue abx for strep pneumo pneumonia & HD per renal
   # Anemia: acute drop since admission from 32
22.  No e/o of gross
   bleeding.  Stable w/o transfusion.
   - check hemolysis labs

   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications

   .
   #HTN. Initially presented with hypertensive emergency after missing
   dialysis, was treated effectively with nitro gtt to temporize her for
   dialysis. In setting of probably evolving sepsis, pt unable to tolerate
   planned fluid removal of 4L with resultant hypotension.  Pt currently
   nml BP off all agents.
   -slowly restart anytihypertensives; consider resuming lisinopril 20mg
   [**Hospital1 **] after HD if pt stable
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism.
- She presented with missing multiple dialysis sessions, hypertensive emergency, and respiratory failure.
- The patient was initially intubated due to increased work of breathing, but successfully extubated.
- She had a respiratory infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, which was treated with antibiotics.
- The patient also had anemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, asthma, and a psychiatric condition.
- Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg and a heart rate of 81 bpm.
- The patient had leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and an elevated temperature, indicating a possible septic shock.
- Fluid balance showed an intake of 1127 mL and output of 251 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 876 mL.
- The patient received various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and antihypertensives.
- Her laboratory results indicated abnormalities in kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of certain enzymes.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory distress, but successfully recovered after treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient had signs of infection, including leukocytosis, fever, and elevated lactate levels"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented with multiple missed dialysis sessions, hypertensive emergency, and respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated due to increased work of breathing (RR > 40) but successfully extubated after respiratory failure. The patient also has a superimposed pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and her chest X-ray is improving with hemodialysis and antibiotics.

The patient's anemia has dropped acutely since admission, but there are no signs of gross bleeding. The patient is stable without transfusion, and further evaluation of hemolysis labs is recommended. The patient was likely in septic shock, which has resolved, and is off of pressors for over 24 hours. The likely source of infection is the lungs, as indicated by the appearance of the chest X-ray and the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the sputum gram stain.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled off all agents. The plan is to restart any antihypertensive medications, including resuming lisinopril at a dose of 20mg tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4883**] is a 75yo female with ESRD on HD, bipolar disease,
   hypothyroidism, who presents following missing multiple dialysis
   sessions, with hypertensive emergency and resultant respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Shock.  Resolved.  Off of pressors >24hr.  Was likely septic in
   setting of leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, elevated lactate.  Random
   cortisol was 30.Given appearance of CXR and sputum gram stain feel that
   most likely source is lungs (RML).  Sputum w/ strep pneumo growing.
   - Con
t narrowed abx coverage to tx strep pneumo (vanc/ctx + azithro,
   in case there is also atypical)
   -follow up stool, blood, urine and sputum  cultures.  Re-culture if
   spikes.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: successfully extubated.  Was initially intubated
   due to increased work of breathing
RR>40 for prolonged period.  Plan
   was to extubate after dialysis as it was initially thought that resp
   distress was primarily due to excess volume.  However, this failed as
   she was apneic even while off sedation.  CXR, leukocytosis & fever all
   suggest superimposed PNA on top of fluid.  Sputum from admission
   growing strep pneumo.  Likely HAP (as pt regularly at HD, rather than
   VAP as pt was febrile & had WBC before 48hr of being on vent).  CXR
   improving s/p HD & abx.  Family reports that she had been coughing
   before presentation & wondered if she might have a PNA.
    -continue abx for strep pneumo pneumonia & HD per renal
   # Anemia: acute drop since admission from 32
22.  No e/o of gross
   bleeding.  Stable w/o transfusion.
   - check hemolysis labs
negative
   - guaiac stool
   - repeat PM hct & transfuse if con
t to drop
   #ESRD on HD: Typically MWF schedule
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications
   - HD per renal
   .
   #HTN. Initially presented with hypertensive emergency after missing
   dialysis, was treated effectively with nitro gtt to temporize her for
   dialysis. In setting of probably evolving sepsis, pt unable to tolerate
   planned fluid removal of 4L with resultant hypotension.  Pt currently
   nml BP off all agents.
   -slowly restart anytihypertensives; consider resuming lisinopril 20mg
   [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl.
   .
   #Asthma: Continue outpatient regimen
   .
   #Psych: Continue outpatient regimen.  Call psych now that pt extubated.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism.
- She presented with missed multiple dialysis sessions, hypertensive emergency, and resultant respiratory failure.
- The patient experienced shock, which has resolved, and is no longer on pressors.
- She had leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, elevated lactate, and a random cortisol level of 30.
- The most likely source of infection is the lungs, specifically right middle lobe pneumonia (RML), as indicated by sputum gram stain showing streptococcus pneumoniae.
- Antibiotic coverage has been narrowed to treat strep pneumo, and follow-up cultures are planned.
- The patient successfully extubated after initially being intubated due to increased work of breathing.
- She had respiratory failure, likely due to a superimposed pneumonia on top of fluid overload.
- Chest X-ray showed improvement after hemodialysis and antibiotic therapy.
- The patient had an acute drop in hemoglobin levels since admission but is stable without transfusion.
- She has a history of ESRD on HD, bipolar disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and psych issues.
- The patient is currently off all antihypertensive agents but should have them restarted slowly, considering resuming lisinopril 20mg tomorrow.

- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/47 to 179/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient's weight is 85.9 kg, height is 62 inches, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1127 mL, output of 251 mL, and a positive balance of 876 mL.
- The patient is not receiving respiratory support.
- The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PCO2 of 37 mmHg, PO2 of 134 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 94%.
- The patient's lab results include WBC count of 27.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, sodium of 140 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, magnesium of 22 mEq/L, glucose of 70 mg/dL, creatinine of 9.4 mg/dL, and lactate of 1.0 mmol/L.
- The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on 08/16/2132 at 11:41 PM.
- The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, which may lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged use of antibiotics suggests a possible infection. Infections can spread and cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 876 mL, indicating possible fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level of 94% is below the normal range, indicating potential hypoxemia. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 9.4 mg/dL suggests acute kidney injury, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, infection, or medication toxicity.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and behavioral issues. She was admitted to the ICU after missing at least two sessions of hemodialysis, resulting in acute decompensation requiring intubation due to aspiration versus flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been clinically improved. She has a history of cognitive impairment/Parkinsonianism, and her allergies include Haldol, Mellaril, Ibuprofen, Lithium, and Depakote. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for increased work of breathing in the setting of volume overload and now is complicated by pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting a community-acquired pathogen. The patient will continue receiving ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin until sensitivities return.
2. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive on admission but transiently required Levophed to maintain her blood pressure in the setting of sepsis. Currently, hypertension is the main issue, and consideration will be given to restarting outpatient medications if the patient remains hypertensive after dialysis.

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and other psychiatric issues. She was admitted to the ICU after missing at least two sessions of hemodialysis and presented with profound hypertension and volume overload. The patient developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She also has a fever and gram-positive cocci in the sputum, which is concerning for pneumonia with sepsis syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially due to increased work of breathing in the setting of volume overload, but now it is complicated by pneumonia. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, her sputum culture grew Strep Pneumo, suggesting that her pneumonia may indeed be a community-acquired pathogen. The plan is to continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin until sensitivities return.

2. Hypertension: The patient was initially hypertensive on admission but transiently required Levophed to maintain her blood pressure in the setting of sepsis. Currently, hypertension remains an issue, and the plan is to consider restarting outpatient medications if the patient is still hypertensive after dialysis.

3. Hyperkalemia/ESRD: The patient's hyperkalemia will"

She missed at least two sessions of HD and presented to the emergency room. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Her sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that her pneumonia may be a community-acquired pathogen. She will continue receiving ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin until the sensitivities return.

The patient's blood pressure was initially hypertensive, but she transiently required norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure during sepsis. Currently, her main issue is hypertension, and she may consider restarting outpatient medications if she remains hypertensive after dialysis.

She has hyperkalemia/ESRD and will continue with Renal assistance. Her plan for HD is today. Her infection control measures include following cultures, continuing antibiotics, aiming for a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-12, using pressors for blood pressure support as needed, and maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
