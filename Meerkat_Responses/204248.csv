   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of COPD on home O2, Diastolic
   CHF who presents with sob and hypoxia likely due to copd exacerbation
   unable to wean from bipap.
   .
   # Hypoxia: CXR showed potentially improved aeration, but difficult to
   asses given position, could represent pneumona vs, COPD exacerbation.
   Other possibilities include contribution from DHF.
   - Change solumedrol to 80 mg Q8hours
   - continue Alb/Atrovent nebs q4hrs standing
   - change antibiotics to vanc/levo
   - f/u sputum
   -get urine legionella
   - follow up CBC
   -maintain oxygen 88-92 % sat
   .
   # Diastolic Heart Failure:Long standing
   - continue Toprol 50mg daily
   - check BNP, if markedly elevated continue lasix 80 mg IV BID
   - daily weights, strict i/os
   - f/u PM lytes
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently rate controlled and anticoagulated
   with coumadin
   - continue Toprol 50mg daily
   - HOld Coumadin, f/u INR
   .
   # ARF: baseline 0.9, today 1.2
   - will gently hydrate (already received 1LNS in ED) and recheck in AM,
   if no improvement would obtain lytes
   - would not hold lasix at this point and just monitor
   - will hold acetazolamide for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic heart failure (DHF), and atrial fibrillation (AF). She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She was unable to wean from non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicates a need for oxygen supplementation. The CXR showed potentially improved aeration but could represent pneumonia or COPD exacerbation.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of DHF, which may contribute to her current symptoms. Management includes continuing Toprol 50mg daily, checking BNP levels, and administering Lasix 80 mg IV BID if markedly elevated.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently rate-controlled and anticoagulated with Coumadin. Toprol 50mg daily should be continued, and INR levels should be monitored.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.9, and today it is 1.2. Gentle hydration and rechecking in the morning are recommended. If no improvement, obtaining electrolytes should be considered. Lasix should not be held at this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She was unable to wean from non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and required mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). She has a history of being a non-invasive resident, which raises concerns about potential infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in mental status is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's COPD exacerbation may have predisposed her to pneumonia. Clinical signs of infection, including fever, productive cough, and leukocytosis, should be closely monitored.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Despite normal blood glucose levels, the patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for DKA during periods of stress or infection. Regular monitoring of blood glucose and electrolytes is essential.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal parameters"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AF). She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She has been unable to wean from BiPAP. The patient's current condition is less responsive after receiving morphine and ativan overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a possible hypoxic condition. This could be due to COPD exacerbation, pneumona, or contribution from diastolic heart failure.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which may contribute to her current symptoms.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has poorly controlled AF and is currently anticoagulated with Coumadin. Rate control and anticoagulation management are necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR increased to 5.7 yesterday, likely due to the interaction between levofloxacin and Coumadin. There is a risk of bleeding or the need for blood transfusion.
5. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine has increased from 0.9 to 1.2, indicating a possible ARF. Lasix administration is recommended to manage fluid overload.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and was unable to wean from BIPAP. She is currently on multiple medications including solumedrol, alb/atrovent nebs, vanc/levo antibiotics, metoprolol, and lasix. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 97/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on BIPAP. She has an increased BNP of 5000, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.21, pCO2 of 90, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260. Her physical examination reveals rhonchi throughout with scarce wheezes, irregular fast S1 & S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, and her JVP is not elevated. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on coumadin, but her INR is elevated at 4.9 due to levofloxacin interaction. She also has renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 0.9 and today's result of 1.2. She is on a regimen of furosemide, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her ICU care includes prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress indicate a potential complication related to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's history of diastolic heart failure and the presence of symptoms such as shortness of breath suggest that her heart failure may be worsening.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's poorly controlled atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events and potential complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR due to levofloxacin interaction indicates a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The increase in creatinine levels suggests a decline in kidney function, which may lead to further complications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure and hypotension. The patient's BNP level was significantly elevated at 5000. He has been receiving IV Lasix, morphine, and Ativan. The patient's pCO2 level was high at 90 and did not respond initially, but there was some improvement after changing the BiPAP settings. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, omeprazole, morphine, furosemide, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's urine output is low at 1,500 mL over the past 24 hours, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's high pCO2 level and dependence on BiPAP suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The elevated WBC count and lactic acid level could indicate an infection or sepsis.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and bilirubin suggest possible hepatic dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an abnormal electrolyte panel with low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She is currently less responsive after receiving morphine and ativan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a compromised respiratory system. This could be due to a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, and her symptoms may be exacerbated by this condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing poorly controlled atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a potential bleeding risk. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine has increased from baseline, suggesting potential renal dysfunction. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent further deterioration.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating dehydration. Adequate fluid management is crucial to maintain proper hydration and prevent complications.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased nutritional status increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular reposition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and anxiety. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She is currently unable to wean off BiPap and has been admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk of hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's history of diastolic CHF suggests a risk of worsening heart failure, which can result in fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's poorly controlled atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism. Monitoring and managing her heart rate and rhythm control are essential.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR indicates a potential risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring and appropriate dosing adjustments are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The rising serum creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by factors like hypotension, medications, or underlying comorbidities. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and anxiety. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She is currently on BiPap support but unable to wean off it. Her mental status has become less responsive after receiving morphine and ativan overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs, which can lead to tissue damage or organ dysfunction.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's long-standing diastolic CHF may worsen due to the increased strain on the heart caused by the COPD exacerbation and other comorbidities.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's poorly controlled atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR suggests a bleeding risk, which could be exacerbated by the use of certain medications like levofloxacin.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The increase in serum creatinine levels indicates potential kidney dysfunction, which may be due to dehydration or other factors.
6. Anxiety: The patient's increasing anxiety may further complicate her condition and hinder effective management.
7. Infection: The presence of leuk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anxiety. She was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of her COPD and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has been on BiPAP support, but she does not tolerate it well, with oxygen saturation levels between 88-92% and fluctuating PCO2 levels on ventilatory gases. The family has expressed a desire to continue treatment but not intubate or resuscitate, and the patient is currently DNR/DNI. Overnight, the patient experienced increasing anxiety, which is common in critically ill patients. However, the use of ativan and morphine resulted in excessive somnolence. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/61 mmHg to 110/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an input of 491 mL and output of 1250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -760 mL. Blood products totaling 320 mL have been given. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with severe COPD and restriction due to kyphoscoliosis. She presents with an exacerbation of COPD and has been on and off bipap overnight. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is on medication, and her current heart rhythm is AFib. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 to 114/90 mmHg, heart rate between 108-133 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 86%. The patient is receiving various medications, including metoprolol, buspar, omeprazole, digoxin, levofloxacin, insulin, lasix, and methylprednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary complaint is respiratory failure, which is likely due to an exacerbation of her COPD. This condition can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient has a history of AFib, and her current heart rhythm is AFib. The rapid ventricular response may increase the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 760 mL over the past 24 hours. This could indicate dehydration or excessive fluid removal,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of COPD on home O2, Diastolic CHF who presents with
   sob and hypoxia likely due to COPD exacerbation unable to wean from
   BIPAP.
   # Hypoxia: CXR showed potentially improved aeration, but difficult to
   asses given position, could represent pneumona vs, COPD exacerbation.
   Other possibilities include contribution from DHF.  Has not required
   bipap or NRB over last day, is on 50% facemask.  Holding steady on
   course of steroids, abx and nebs.
   - Continuing lower dose solumedrol to 20 mg Q8hours
   - continue Alb/Atrovent nebs q4hrs standing
   - continue levo
   - f/u sputum
   - maintain oxygen 88-92 % sat
   - lasix 120 per below
   # Diastolic and systolic Heart Failure:Long standing
   - metoprolol stopped and changed to diltiazem for better afib rate
   control
   - Lasix 120mg IV bid with UOP/PM lyte-titrate to 1-2 L negative, was
   1.5 L negative yesterday
   - daily weights, strict i/os although is complaining of thirst a lot
   and can loosen fluid restriction
   - PM lytes
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently poorly rate controlled and
   anticoagulated with coumadin
   - put on dilt gtt overnight due to RVR, controlled with HRs in the 80s
   today
   - transition to PO dilt, titrate as needed, metoprolol can be added on
   as well
   # Coagulopathy: INR increased to 4.9 [**12-26**] due to levo/coumadin
   interaction, dose changed INR 2.0 today
   -          Trend, transfuse FFP for bleeding or procedures
   -          Continue levofloxacin
   -          Coumadin still being held, will monitor INR and restart as
   needed.
   # ARF: baseline 0.9, high of 1.3, now at 1.1
   - Lasix as above, follow creatinine, is improving

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been unable to wean from BIPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen levels, as indicated by her SpO2 of 92%. This could be due to a COPD exacerbation or potential pneumonia.
2. Diastolic and Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is currently being managed with diuretics and fluid restriction. Close monitoring of her fluid status and electrolytes is essential to prevent worsening heart failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation, which is poorly controlled. Rate control is crucial to prevent hemodynamic instability and further complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an increased INR due to the interaction between levo and coumadin. This increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of INR and appropriate dosing adjustments are necessary.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Careful monitoring of renal function and appropriate management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, along with chronic diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's recent events include an increase in metoprolol dosage but still not rate-controlled, initiation of IV diltiazem, and a subsequent diltiazem drip for better rate control. The patient was also taken off albuterol nebs. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98.5 F), a heart rate of 99 bpm with an irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF), blood pressure ranging from 109/53 to 122/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set at a pressure support of 12 cmH2O, peak expiratory flow (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 60%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and was unable to wean from BIPAP. The note indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be a result of COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. It is important to monitor and maintain oxygen saturation between 88-92%.

2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure. Treatment includes continuing metoprolol 25mg TID, administering Lasix 120mg IV once, and closely monitoring fluid balance, daily weights, and strict intake/output measurements.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently poorly controlled and she is anticoagulated with coumadin. Treatment involves continuing metoprolol 25mg PO TID with Lopressor IV PRN, increasing metoprolol as needed for heart rate control, holding Coumadin, and monitoring INR levels.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has increased to 4.9 yesterday, likely due to an interaction with levofloxacin. This has resulted in a coagulopathy. Treatment includes transfusing fresh frozen plasma for bleeding or procedures,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She has not been able to wean from BIPAP. The patient has been treated with steroids, antibiotics, and nebulizers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation has been maintained at 88-92%. Further assessment is needed to determine the cause, which could be a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia.
2. Diastolic and systolic Heart Failure: The patient is receiving Lasix 120mg IV bid, along with fluid restriction and daily weights to manage her heart failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is currently being controlled with diltiazem, and she may transition to PO diltiazem with possible addition of metoprolol.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR increased to 4.9 due to levo/coumadin interaction, but it has been corrected to 2.0. She will continue to be monitored, and FFP may be transfused for bleeding or procedures.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are improving, and she is being managed with Lasix.
6. Family Education: The patient's daughter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. She was unable to wean from BIPAP and is currently on a 50% face mask. The patient has been on a course of steroids, antibiotics, and nebulizers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's CXR showed potentially improved aeration, but it is difficult to assess given the position, which could represent pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. Other possibilities include contribution from diastolic heart failure. The patient is holding steady on the current course of treatment, including steroids, antibiotics, and nebulizers.
2. Diastolic and systolic Heart Failure: The patient has long-standing heart failure. Metoprolol was stopped and changed to diltiazem for better rate control of atrial fibrillation. Lasix 120mg IV is given twice daily, with urine output and electrolytes to be monitored. Daily weights and strict intake/output are also being monitored.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently poorly rate-controlled and anticoagulated with coumadin. The patient was put on dilt gtt overnight due to rapid ventricular response, which was controlled with heart rates in the 80s today. Transition to PO d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been on home oxygen for two months. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow neb. She is alert and awake but not oriented, with generalized weakness and no focal deficits. Physical examination reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with bowel sounds present. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other values are within normal limits. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary issue is hypoxia due to a COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and adjusting oxygen delivery as necessary is crucial.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has poorly controlled atrial fibrillation. Rate control measures such as diltiazem and metoprolol should be continued or adjusted based on heart rate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, and systolic heart failure. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk for hypoxia. This can be exacerbated by her COPD exacerbation and may require continued oxygen therapy.

2. Contraction Alkalosis: The patient has been holding Lasix due to contraction alkalosis. This condition occurs when there is excessive loss of fluids through diuresis, leading to an increase in blood pH. It is important to monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent further complications.

3. Diastolic and systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of both diastolic and systolic heart failure. These conditions can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and fluid balance is crucial to manage these complications.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is poorly rate-controlled. This increases the risk of thromboembolic events and requires anticoagulation therapy. Monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and adjusting anticoagulant therapy as needed is essential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient was placed on high-flow oxygen and received two doses of Diltiazem for rate control. Phosphate repletion was also administered.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/60 mmHg to 132/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 1,404 mL, including 300 mL of IV fluids. The total output was 3,470 mL, with 235 mL of urine output. The patient has received a total of 804 mL of IV fluids.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of jugular venous distension, lung crackles, or edema. Neurological examination shows generalized weakness but no focal deficits. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, normal platelet count of 189 K/uL, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anxiety. The patient presented with tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of volume depletion. He received 2 liters of normal saline bolus, which improved his tachycardia, and was given two doses of Diltizem 30mg PO. The patient continues to receive a Diltizem drip. His electrolytes were repleted.

24-hour events include the administration of NS bolus, improvement in tachycardia, and repletion of phosphorus. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 126/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 93% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals an awake and alert individual with no focal deficits or generalized weakness. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are warm and well perfused. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but no evidence of leg edema or jugular venous distension.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, and a blood glucose level of 136 mg/dL. His creatinine level is 1."
