   Chief Complaint: Encephalopathy
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - STOP [**2102-10-17**] 06:50 PM
   - 430p labs showing 10pt drop in Na. D5W already finished by this
   point, didn't give more. At baseline poor mental status
   - PICC pulled
   - BP's low through the evening to the 80's, but not tachycardic.
   Watched. Early in am, bp's down to 70's so bolus 500 cc's NS (instead
   of D5W due to Na drop) and started empiric Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. If
   continued through tomorrow, will need ID approval
   - PM CXR IMPRESSION: Bilateral basal infiltrates, more on the left than
   right, can explain patient's increasing fevers. Observe, however that
   these abnormalities existed already on several previous portable chest
   examinations.

   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone - clarify date of last dose.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   .
   # Agitation/altered mental status.  Multifactorial delerium -
   electrolyte abnormalities, encephalitis, med related.  Also with some
   chronic narcotic use.
   - Correct lytes
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol prn agitation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Difficulty weaning off vent now s/p trach.
   Seems to desat with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on
   imaging.  [**Month (only) 11**] be hypoventilating to some degree with sedation meds as
   above. Recent mini-BAL negative. Today tolerating trach mask well.
   - CXR today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   .
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3); Tmax 102.8
   yesterday.  Blood cultures drawn; urine with a few WBCs.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate though was one day prior.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Repeat UA with culture.
   - Send C.diff.
   - d/c PICC and send tip culture.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic.
   - Free water in tube feeds doubled today.
   - 1 more liter of D5W today.
   - repeat lytes in PM today.
   .
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - clarify treatment duration with ophthalmology.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs.  Mild yesterday. ?ceftriaxone related.
   - Recheck tomorrow.
   - If still abnormal, check RUQ US.
   .
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; though benign and not
   related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   .
   # HTN.  Well controlled on metoprolol; written for prn
   antihypertensives, which we will hold.
   - continue metoprolol.

   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   .
   # Hypotension: had period of hypotension overnight with SBPs to 70s.
   Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that should possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel.
   - Final read for CXR infiltrates is equivocal and patient was
   afebrile.  It is unclear whether he has a new infection.  Also,
   considering that he was already on ceftriaxone, not sure if adding
   zosyn is useful.  We can continue antibiotics for 48 hours after all
   cultures negative.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID.  We
   will reduce his dose to 25mg TID to avoid hypotension.
   .
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.

   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   .
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, we will d/c IV
   thiamine, folate and multivitamin.

   to desat with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has altered mental status, fever, and a previous diagnosis of Bells Palsy. The patient has been transferred from another facility with continued altered mental status and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension overnight and in the morning, which responded to IV fluids and empiric antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. The hypotension also occurred after receiving several medications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required respiratory support but is now doing well at 20 hours on a tracheal mask. There is a concern for atelectasis and the need to continue weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.

3. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, with a Tmax of 102.8 yesterday. Blood cultures have been drawn, and further investigations are needed to identify the cause of the fever.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels improved yesterday but require close monitoring with free water boluses during tube feeds.

5. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that may be related to his neurologic deficits. Ophthalmology follow-up recommendations have been given.

6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs have shown mild elevation and wors"

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   70s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear that
   this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since [**2102-9-16**]
   at 7am.
   - BP
s currently look good but if continued hypotension consider DC
   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's medical history includes bells palsy, hypotension, Lyme encephalitis, tachycardia, agitation/altered mental status, respiratory failure, fever, corneal ulcer, elevated liver function tests, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, and hypernatremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 139/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 20, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 27.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is awake, alert, and tries to answer questions but cannot talk due to tracheostomy, follows commands, and has tremor in his left hand. Coarse rhonchi are heard bilaterally, and his cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are benign without any signs of lower extremity edema.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Lyme encephalitis, respiratory failure, and delirium. He was previously on mechanical ventilation but was extubated yesterday due to improved respiratory status. However, he experienced an episode of mucous plugging and required reintubation. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved mental status and respiratory function. He is still experiencing encephalopathy and delirium. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Lyme disease. He also has altered mental status, which is not consistent with delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function can deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient's mental status remains altered, and there is a risk of worsening delirium, which can impact his overall prognosis and recovery.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
5. Neurological Complications: Lyme en"

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Will try stopping some antihypertensives and see if
   this improves. D/c clonodine given that he is on metoprolol for control
   of HR after an accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient has been on a planned 4-week course of ceftriaxone for Lyme encephalitis, now on day 25. However, it was noted that ceftriaxone is not good coverage for Pseudomonas, so there is a concern about potential antibiotic resistance.
2. The patient has been experiencing periods of hypotension, which responded to IV fluids and started on vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, recent cultures have been negative, making PNA less likely.
3. The patient had an episode of desaturation while on tracheal mask, leading to the decision to place him back on mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status is improving, and weaning from the ventilator is being attempted as tolerated.
4. The patient has chronic narcotic use and is currently on methadone for pain control. An attempt will be made to wean off methadone safely.
5. The patient has been experiencing agitation and altered mental status, primarily due to encephalitis. He responds well to PRN haldol but will try to minimize chemical sedation and restraints.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear that
   this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at
   4pm.
   - BP
s currently look good but if continued hypotension consider DC
   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP, admitted for neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He is currently being treated with ceftriaxone for Lyme disease and has shown some persistent neurologic deficits. The patient has also been experiencing agitation and altered mental status, which is believed to be primarily due to encephalitis but may also be caused by electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infection, or medication-related factors. 

The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which responded to IV fluids and the initiation of vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, his blood pressure is currently stable. 

He has a history of tachycardia, for which he was evaluated by cardiology and found to have an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Metoprolol was increased but then reduced to 25mg TID. 

The patient has respiratory failure and is currently doing well on a tracheostomy mask. He has atelectasis on imaging but is expected to undergo a tracheostomy mask trial today. 

The patient has had a fever but has been afebrile since October 16th. Cultures have been negative, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started due to transient hypotensive episodes. 

He also has a corneal ulcer that occurred after eyelid suturing and is believed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. Here is a summary of the potential medical complications:

1. Lyme encephalitis: The patient is suspected to have Lyme encephalitis based on MRI findings, serum, and CSF serologies. They are on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks, but some persistent neurologic deficits are present. Neurology follow-up is recommended.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced an episode of desaturation while on a tracheostomy mask and was placed back on mechanical ventilation. They are being weaned off the vent as tolerated and antibiotics have been started for possible pneumonia.

3. Fever: The patient had daily low-grade temperatures but has been afebrile since October 16th. Cultures have been negative, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to transient hypotensive episodes.

4. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension with blood pressures in the 80s, which responded to IV fluids. Medications such as metoprolol, clonidine, methadone, and seroquel may have contributed to the hypotension. Sepsis is a possibility, but further investigation is needed.

5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that occurred after eyelid suturing. Ophthalmology follow-up is recommended, and the patient is on vig"

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Will try stopping some antihypertensives and see if
   this improves. D/c clonodine given that he is on metoprolol for control
   of HR after an accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted for neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been experiencing altered mental status, agitation, and fever. The patient also has respiratory failure, corneal ulcer, elevated liver function tests, and an accelerated idioventricular rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation due to episodes of desaturation related to secretions. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but recent sputum cultures have been negative.

2. Lyme Encephalitis: The patient is on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone for planned 4 weeks, but there are concerns about persistent neurologic deficits and the potential for permanent damage.

3. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that is likely related to his inability to protect his eye due to neurologic deficits. He is currently receiving topical antibiotics.

4. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: The patient had an episode of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which was evaluated by cardiology and deemed benign.

5. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient has had elevated levels of potassium and slightly low levels of bicarbonate, which need to be closely monitored and corrected if necessary.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm.
   - D/c clonodine and monitor response
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Psychiatry consult today
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. On antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
   -Repeat CXR
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Cipro, Cefepime.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator due to an episode of desaturation and potential pneumonia. The plan is to continue weaning off the vent as tolerated.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, cognition, muscle performance, and transfers. This could be due to encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infection, or medication-related issues. Frequent reorientation is being attempted to avoid chemical sedation and restraints.

3. Lyme Encephalitis: The patient has neurologic changes and fever, which are highly suggestive of Lyme encephalitis. He is currently on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks.

4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, possibly related to medication administration or an underlying brewing sepsis. IV fluids have been given, and certain medications (such as clonidine and methadone) are being tapered off.

5. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer likely related to his neurologic deficits. Vigamox and bacitracin ointment are being applied, and he will follow up with ophthalmology recommendations.

6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are improving but may be due to ceftriaxone or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He has continued altered mental status, fever, and neurologic deficits. The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone for Lyme disease, seroquel for agitation, and methadone for chronic pain control. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal right pleural effusion, elevated and atelectatic right lung base, and mild atelectasis at the left base. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of neurologic changes, altered mental status, and periods of apnea while sleeping may indicate a risk for respiratory failure. The presence of elevated and atelectatic right lung base also suggests possible impaired gas exchange.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. This could be due to sepsis or an adverse reaction to medications.
3. Lyme Disease: The patient has been diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis and is currently on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone. However, there is a concern for persistent neurologic deficits.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, qafternoon
   and then 50mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up. Will check urine
   chloride to assess if possibly volume depleted.
   -ABG
   -Urine chloride
   -Will give diamox
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone for planned 4 weeks, now on day 26 of 28. The patient's primary issues include agitation/altered mental status, respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, fever, corneal ulcer, elevated LFTs, and an accelerated idioventricular rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are still periods of apnea when sleeping. A tracheostomy trial today is planned to continue weaning off the ventilator.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb levels are trending up, and urine chloride will be checked to assess if the patient is volume depleted. Diamox will be given.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of low blood pressure in the 80s, and IV fluids have been started. Some antihypertensive medications will be stopped to improve blood pressure.
4. Lyme Disease: The patient has been diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis, and he is currently on ceftriaxone for treatment. Neurology follow-up is planned to assess neurologic deficits.

   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg

   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several

   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP, admitted with neurological changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has altered mental status, fever, respiratory failure, agitation, hypotension, and a corneal ulcer. The patient is currently on a 28-day course of ceftriaxone for Lyme disease and has been weaned off some medications. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's recent cultures have been negative, and his CXR shows improvement in bilateral base opacification. The plan is to continue weaning him off the ventilator and minimize medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could lead to prolonged ventilation or the need for tracheostomy.
2. Agitation/Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially leading to increased confusion, delirium, or aggression.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can increase the risk of shock or organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
4. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that requires regular monitoring and treatment to prevent complications such as vision loss or infection.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone for planned 4 weeks, with some persistent neurologic deficits. The patient also has agitation/altered mental status, which could be due to encephalitis or other factors. He is responding well to PRN haldol but will try to avoid chemical sedation and restraints. Methadone for chronic pain control is being weaned off. The patient has had periods of hypotension and is being treated for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with IV fluids and antibiotics. His respiratory failure is improving, and the need for mechanical ventilation is being weaned off. The patient had a corneal ulcer post eyelid suturing and is being treated with vigamox and bacitracin ointment. Elevated liver function tests are improving but still need monitoring. The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm is being managed with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a significant concern. He had an episode of desaturation leading to the reintroduction of mechanical ventilation. Although his CXR has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to secretions or underlying lung pathology.

2. Agitation/Altered Mental Status:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and intracerebral thrombosis, admitted with neurological changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He is currently on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone for 4 weeks. The patient's mental status remains altered, and he has periods of agitation. There is a concern for potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, corneal ulcer, elevated liver function tests, and an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, haldol, seroquel, methadone, and metoprolol. The family meeting was held to discuss goals of care, including weaning from the ventilator, improving mental status, and continuing to search for any sources and signs of infection. Long-term acute rehab was discussed as the most likely next destination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiration/gas exchange and has periods of apnea while sleeping. A tracheostomy trial is planned today.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of low blood pressure in the 80s. IV fluids and antibiotics were started for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia, but recent cultures have been negative.
3. Fever: The patient had daily low-grade temperatures until October 16th but has been afebrile since then. Antibiotics were initially"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/90 mmHg to 170/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient has a history of various allergies, including lorazepam, ibuprofen, and an unknown allergen. They have received multiple courses of antibiotics since admission, including cefipime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and slightly elevated platelet (Plt) levels. Other lab parameters, such as creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. Imaging shows a tracheostomy tube placed 5.5 cm above the carina and a PICC line inserted into the lateral right subclavian vein or axillary vein.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, q afternoon
   and then 50mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up. Will check urine
   chloride to assess if possibly volume depleted.
   -ABG
   -Urine chloride
   -Will give diamox
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require ongoing monitoring and management.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The tracheostomy tube placement is at the fifth-sixth centimeter above the carina. The recent chest X-ray shows improvement, reducing the likelihood of pneumonia. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has persistent altered mental status attributed to encephalitis, although other factors like electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, or medication-related causes may also contribute. Frequent reorientation and minimizing medications are part of the management plan.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. IV fluids and stopping some antihypertensive medications have been initiated to address this issue.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are trending upward. Further evaluation with urine chloride and administration of diamox (acetazolamide) will be done to manage this condition.

5. Lyme Encephalitis: The patient is on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for Lyme encephalitis. This treatment will continue for another two days,"

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning. [**Month (only) 11**] want to see if we can give 37.5 qHS instead
   of 50.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, q afternoon
   and then 37.5 mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has periods of apnea when sleeping. There is a concern for respiratory failure, especially since the patient is not responding well to tracheostomy trials.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an elevated bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This could be due to various factors such as vomiting, diuretic use, or renal dysfunction.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing periods of low blood pressure (hypotension) and has responded to IV fluids. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent further complications.

4. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment, the patient still has a fever. There is a concern for a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or another source of infection.

5. Neurologic deficits: The patient has ongoing neurologic deficits, including altered mental status and impaired muscle performance. These deficits may be permanent or reversible, and further evaluation by neurology is recommended.

6. Lyme encephalitis: The patient is suspected to have Lyme encephalitis, which is a complication of Lyme disease. The patient is already on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for planned 4 weeks.

7. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that likely occurred due to the inability to protect the"

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Decrease Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Nursing will work on timing meds
   better today.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Lyme encephalitis: The patient has been diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis, which is highly suspected based on MRI findings, serum, and CSF serologies. He is currently on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for 28 days.

2. Agitation/altered mental status: The patient is experiencing agitation and altered mental status primarily due to encephalitis. Other factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infection, and medication-related causes may also contribute to this condition.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, with periods of apnea when sleeping. There is an improvement in the chest X-ray, making pneumonia less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, with bicarbonate normalization. The urine chloride was normal, suggesting that he is not volume depleted. The source of metabolic alkalosis is unclear and may not be related to hypokalemia since potassium levels are normal.

5. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. This may be related to medication side effects or interactions.

6. Fever: The patient had"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted for neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He continues to have altered mental status and fever. The patient's respiratory status has improved, making pneumonia less likely. The patient is on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for planned 4 weeks. Persistent neurological deficits are expected, and neurology is following up. The patient's agitation may be multifactorial, including electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, and medication-related factors. Seroquel has been increased and then decreased due to sedation and apnea. Tracheostomy tube trial is planned today. The patient has metabolic alkalosis with normalized bicarb, but the source is unclear. Hypotension episodes have occurred, possibly related to Seroquel. Antibiotics were started for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia but have since been discontinued due to negative cultures. Other issues include corneal ulcer, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and an accelerated idioventricular rhythm."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - Plan was that we were d/c'ing ABx and waiting for an infection to
   declare itself if there was one present. If he continues to be febrile
   and WBC's increase will need to reconsider adding ABx, wiill watch
   through today
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone which is to end today.  With some persistent neurologic
   deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28, and will d/c after
   today
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period so trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more
   recently. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs.
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired respiration/gas exchange and is on standby ventilation mode. There is a need to monitor ABG to reassess the respiratory status.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has altered bicarbonate levels, which need to be monitored and further investigated.

3. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of low blood pressure, especially after certain medication doses. It is important to adjust the timing of medications and consider stopping antihypertensives to improve the blood pressure.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, and it is necessary to restart free water administration and monitor electrolyte levels regularly.

5. Fever: The patient has persistent low-grade temperatures despite being on antibiotics. This requires close monitoring, and if the fever persists, recultures of everything should be done.

6. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, likely due to neurologic deficits. It is important to continue with the prescribed ophthalmic medications and follow up with ophthalmology recommendations.

7. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient had elevated LFTs, which have since normalized. It is essential to continue monitoring the liver function.

8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient experienced an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which was deemed benign by cardiology. The patient is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and ITP admitted with neurological changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course of ceftriaxone for 28 days but still has persistent neurologic deficits. The patient's current conditions include agitation/altered mental status, respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, fever, corneal ulcer, elevated liver function tests, hypernatremia, and an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. The patient's medications include clonidine, seroquel, methadone, furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, and various other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he has had periods of apnea while sleeping. The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with slightly elevated creatinine and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, except for elevated sodium levels. The patient's recent imaging shows stable atelectasis and no overt pulmonary edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory status indicates impaired respiration/gas exchange, and he has periods of apnea while sleeping. This may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an ongoing metabolic alkalosis, which needs to be"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab screening
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; added PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night given that he was agitated last night
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period of  trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurological changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He is currently in the ICU with continued altered mental status and fevers. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, there are some abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum albumin.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired respiration and gas exchange, and there is a mention of respiratory failure, possibly due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort is crucial.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an alteration in elimination related to constipation, which may contribute to metabolic alkalosis. Close monitoring of bicarbonate levels and urine chloride is necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient has previously experienced episodes of hypotension, requiring IV fluids and antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is important to monitor blood pressure regularly and adjust medication doses accordingly.

4. Agitation and altered mental status: The patient exhibits agitation and confusion, which could be attributed to encephalitis or other factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, or medication side effects. Frequent reorientation and minimizing medication use are"

   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period of  trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, intracranial thrombosis, and Lyme disease. He was admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for four weeks but still has persistent neurologic deficits.

2. The patient's agitation and altered mental status are primarily due to encephalitis, but could also be caused by electrolyte abnormalities, other concurrent infections, or medications. The patient responds well to haloperidol (Haldol) on an as-needed basis, but efforts will be made to minimize chemical sedation and restraints.

3. The patient is currently on methadone for chronic pain control, but a gradual tapering off will be attempted as it is unclear if the patient is in pain and if he needs it.

4. The patient's respiratory failure is improving, with a recent chest X-ray showing improvement. The patient has been on extended time period tracheostomy collar and does well with it. Inhaled medications will continue to be administered for bronchospasm.

5. The patient has metabolic alkalosis, with bicarbonate levels normalized. The source of the alkalosis is unclear, but it is not related to hypokalemia as the potassium levels are normal. Monitoring will continue, and an arterial blood"

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab?
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period so trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired respiration and gas exchange, indicating a risk of respiratory failure. This is further supported by the presence of atelectasis or pneumonia on the chest X-ray.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels have normalized, but the cause of metabolic alkalosis remains unclear. It is important to monitor and reassess the ABG to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension with SBPs in the 80s. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or fluid imbalances. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluids and medications are necessary to manage this condition.

4. Fever: Despite being on ceftriaxone, the patient continues to have low-grade temperatures. This could indicate an ongoing infection or a non-infectious cause. Further investigation, including cultures and blood tests, is needed to identify the underlying cause.

5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulceration that is likely related to neurologic deficits and an inability to protect the eye. Ophthalmology follow-up is recommended for proper management.

6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient initially had elevated LFTs, but they have since normalized. The etiology of the elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided note. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement followed by worsening symptoms. The patient is on various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis and fibresource HN for nutrition. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but the patient exhibits agitation and impaired cognitive function. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, and constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired respiration/gas exchange and reliance on a tracheostomy tube suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying lung disease or complications from mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation and impaired cognitive function may indicate delirium, which is common in ICU patients. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, worsening respiratory status, and other complications.
3. Constipation: The patient's altered elimination related to constipation is a concern. Prolonged bed rest and certain medications can contribute to constipation, which may further compromise the patient's overall condition if not managed appropriately.
4. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests indicate possible kidney dysfunction. This can lead to electrolyte"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided information. However, based on the progress note, it can be inferred that the patient is experiencing respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis as indicated by the ABG results (7.43/57/117/39). The patient has been discussed on renal rounds tomorrow and will be seen by an ophthalmologist. The patient's allergies include Ativan (Lorazepam), Ibuprofen, and Unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was Ceftriaxone on [**2102-10-23**] at 07:26 AM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation. Other medications include changes to the medical and family history. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 101 bpm (range: 77-111 bpm), blood pressure of 96/61 mmHg (range: 69-151/93-106 mmHg), respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (range: 10-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight is 85.6 kg (admission weight: 83.1 kg) and height is 70 inches. The fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,932 mL with 460 mL given by PO, 1,752 mL given by TF, and 1,120 mL given by IVF. The total output includes 1,860 mL of urine and 385 mL of NG output. The respiratory support includes delivery through a trach mask with an SpO2 of 96% and ABG results of 7.43/57/117/35/11. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 234.

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic examination. The labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, TCO2, and glucose levels. The electrolytes are within normal range except for slightly low potassium and bicarbonate levels. The other lab results include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), amylase, lipase, LDH, and lactic acid levels.

The assessment and plan include impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, balance, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and elimination. The patient is also diagnosed with respiratory failure, Lyme disease, altered mental status, and Bell's palsy. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in mental status, infection due to prolonged ICU stay, and potential complications related to constipation and immobility."

 LYME DISEASE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] (morning,
   afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night. Patient also
   required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis after a 4-week treatment course with ceftriaxone. He has been transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on a tracheostomy collar since Sunday and tolerating it well. He has an improved chest X-ray, making pneumonia less likely. However, he still has respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, suggesting chronic COPD.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are normalized, and urine chloride is normal, suggesting he is not volume depleted. The cause of metabolic alkalosis is unclear, and further discussion with the renal attending is planned.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. This may be related to medication side effects or interactions. Adjustments to antihypertensive medications and IV fluids have been made to address this issue.

4. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Recent cultures have been negative, and the source of infection is unclear. It is important to continue monitoring his temperature and consider recultures if he develops fevers again.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, intracranial thrombosis, and Lyme encephalitis. He has been admitted with neurologic changes and fevers.
- He was previously treated with ceftriaxone for Lyme encephalitis but continues to have altered mental status and agitation.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is tolerating well with the tracheostomy collar. His CXR shows improvement, making pneumonia less likely.
- The patient was also diagnosed with corneal ulceration and received eyelid suturing and antibiotic treatment.
- His laboratory results show elevated levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and blood urea nitrogen. There are also elevated liver enzymes and a slightly elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/61 mmHg to 151/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's balance, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange are impaired. He also has impaired transfers and altered elimination related to constipation.
- The patient's medical complications include agitation/altered mental status, respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, fever, corneal ulcer,"

   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and admitted with neurologic changes due to Lyme encephalitis. He was previously treated with ceftriaxone for four weeks and then transferred to another facility with continued altered mental status and fevers.

The patient is currently experiencing agitation and altered mental status, which is primarily attributed to Lyme encephalitis, but could also be due to electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, or medication-related issues. The patient has been prescribed Seroquel at a dose of 12.5 mg [**Hospital1**] with an additional 25 mg PRN for agitation at night. He also required Haldol for agitation last night.

The patient has respiratory failure, with previous tracheostomy and tolerance. A chest X-ray showed improvement, making pneumonia less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative, and the patient is expected to continue with inhaled medications for bronchospasm.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, with normalized bicarbonate levels. The cause of this condition is unclear, but it is likely related to his respiratory acidosis. The patient's renal attending believes that it is mostly related to respiratory acidosis.

The patient previously had hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids and antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was also started on metoprolol for an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, but this has been resolved after"

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain.
   -KUB in setting of pain to assess for free air
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q4 HCT
   -GI consult
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: unclear if patient is having pain due to poor history.
   -Lactate
   -LFTs, lipase
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis after a four-week treatment course of ceftriaxone. He was transferred to the ICU with continued altered mental status and fevers. The patient's current concerns include agitation/altered mental status, respiratory failure, bloody bowel movement, and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation/Altered Mental Status: The patient has been experiencing agitation and altered mental status, primarily due to Lyme encephalitis. However, it could also be multifactorial, including electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, and medication-related effects. The patient is currently on Seroquel for agitation, and the dose is being adjusted.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on a tracheostomy collar since Sunday and tolerating it well. His recent CXR showed improvement, making pneumonia less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative. The patient most likely has chronic COPD, and inhaled medications are being continued for bronchospasm.

3. Bloody Bowel Movement: The patient had a large bloody bowel movement, which raised concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. Further assessment is needed, including a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) ultrasound to rule out free air, abdominal pain, and ongoing blood loss.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has an elevated"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of Bell's palsy, Lyme disease, and is on methadone for pain management. 

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with an increase in HCT from 10-25% to 34.4% at 3 am on 10/26, indicating possible hemoconcentration due to dehydration. The patient's sodium level is high at 145 mEq/L, suggesting hypernatremia. 

The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but there is a significant drop in systolic blood pressure from 113 mmHg to 92 mmHg over the last 24 hours. The patient's heart rate is stable, but there is a slight increase in respiratory rate.

The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 95%, indicating adequate oxygenation. 

The patient has a history of constipation, as evidenced by the large bloody bowel movement at 2130. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but other lab values including hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, pH within normal range, and slightly elevated bicarbonate level. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient in pain this morning when examined on prerounds;
   received 2mg IV morphine and was seen by surgery, at that point no
   longer in pain. Per his report pain was in the RUQ. Possible etiologies
   of pain in RUQ that resolves include biliary colic, ulcer disease;
   could also be MI. Lactate normal making ischemia less of a concern.
   Patient may have acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of ceftriaxone
   use for 28 days.
   -LFTs, lipase
   -RUQ ultrasound
   -EKG
   -Serial troponins x 3
   -IV PPI
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain. Patient may also have bleeding related to ulcer.
   -PEG tube lavage to assess for UGI bleed.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q6 HCT
   -GI consult  for possible EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

   Disposition:
","The patient has a history of Lyme disease and was treated with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks. However, they continue to have altered mental status and fevers. The patient also has a pain complaint in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), which could be due to biliary colic, ulcer disease, or acalculous cholecystitis, especially considering prolonged use of ceftriaxone. Further evaluation with LFTs, lipase, RUQ ultrasound, EKG, serial troponins, and IV PPI is recommended. The patient also experienced bloody bowel movements, which could be related to hemorrhoids or an upper gastrointestinal bleed. A PEG tube lavage has been performed to assess for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient is on NPO status with active tissue and surgical consults. The patient's agitation and altered mental status may be attributed to Lyme encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, or chronic narcotic use. Methadone is being tapered, and Seroquel has been increased. The patient has a history of chronic pain and has been on methadone 10 mg TID, currently on day 1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with significant smoking history, and inhaled medications will be continued. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, fever, and"

   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current symptoms, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on a tracheostomy collar since Sunday and is tolerating it well. There is an improvement in the chest X-ray, making pneumonia less likely. However, the patient's history of chronic COPD and respiratory acidosis indicates the possibility of respiratory failure.

2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an alteration in elimination related to constipation, which may lead to metabolic alkalosis. This is supported by the presence of fecal loading in the colon.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, and it is important to maintain his sodium at exactly 140. This should be monitored closely.

4. Hypotension: The patient has previously experienced periods of low blood pressure, which responded to intravenous fluids. This may indicate a potential complication related to circulatory issues.

5. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures since [**Date range (1) 9233**]. Although the patient was on ceftriaxone initially, several more antibiotics were added but later pulled off due to the lack of clear infectious source. The presence of fever indicates a possible ongoing infection.

6. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that is likely related to the inability to protect the eye due to neurologic deficits.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient
s pain has resolved. [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to
   constipation given amount of stool in colon. LFTs normal, RUQ
   ultrasound normal, EKG unchanged. Will restart tube feeds and monitor.
   Bowel regimen.
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient no longer having bloody bowel
   movements, HCT has actually returned to baseline without transfusion.
   PEG tube lavage negative, upper source for GI bleeding exceedingly
   unlikely. Patient does not require PPI. GI did not do scope as bleeding
   had stopped.
   -Pt has active T&S
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #2 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding. Recheck
   Na+ in evening. Patient
s sodium dropped dramatically with stopping of
   tube feeds, will need to check salt content of tube feeds.
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and Lyme disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of confusion, disorientation, and difficulty ambulating. Upon arrival, the patient was found to have a fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and evidence of renal dysfunction. The patient was promptly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management of his critical condition.

In the ICU, the patient has been receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and supportive care. His vital signs have been stabilized, and he has shown improvement in his renal function. However, the patient continues to experience altered mental status, which has been attributed to a combination of factors including sepsis, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's recent progress note indicates that he experienced transient right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, which resolved by the time of rounds. The pain prompted the cessation of tube feeds and initiation of nothing by mouth (NPO) status. Lactate levels were measured and found to be within normal range. Liver function tests (LFTs) were also obtained and revealed no abnormalities.

Subsequent laboratory results showed an increase in hematocrit (Hct) from 30.2% to"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient in pain this morning when examined on prerounds;
   received 2mg IV morphine and was seen by surgery, at that point no
   longer in pain. Per his report pain was in the RUQ. Possible etiologies
   of pain in RUQ that resolves include biliary colic, ulcer disease;
   could also be MI. Lactate normal making ischemia less of a concern.
   Patient may have acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of ceftriaxone
   use for 28 days.
   -LFTs, lipase
   -RUQ ultrasound
   -EKG
   -Serial troponins x 3
   -IV PPI
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain. Patient may also have bleeding related to ulcer.
   -PEG tube lavage to assess for UGI bleed.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q6 HCT
   -GI consult  for possible EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o man with
          Acute abdominal pain
 resolved, reassuring imaging and
   serial exams.  ?constipation
          Ongoing encephalopathy and delirium
   o         Differential includes Lyme encephalitis, medication effects,
   general illness, and a combination of above.
   o         Continues to improve
   o         Today, feels somewhat paranoid but easily redirectiible.
   o         We will plan
   1.       Complete methadone taper
   2.       Complete clonidine taper
   3.       Continue seroquel
   4.       Replete free water for hypernatremia (seems quite sensitive)
          Respiratory failure
   o         Resolved -- Doing well on TC now for several days
   o         When on PMV, use nasal cannula
   o         Continue bronchodilators
   o         Continue suctioning
          Fever
   o         Resolved
   o         Off ABX
          AIVR
   o         Currently controlled; seen by cards
   o         Continue metoprolol
          Lyme encephalitis
   o         Now off ceftriaxone
   o         Per neurology, no need for repeat LP
          Metabolic alkalosis
   o         No response to saline challenge.  Etiology unclear, but no
   present need to attempt to correct.
          Corneal ulcer
   o         On rx per ophtho.
   o         Follow-up as per ophtho note
   Discontinue PPI.  Discontinue PICC line and change to PIV.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 63-year-old man with a chief complaint of Lyme encephalitis. He has been in the ICU for multiple complications, including acute abdominal pain, fever, respiratory failure, AIVR (atrial arrhythmias), Lyme encephalitis, metabolic alkalosis, and a corneal ulcer.

The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, with reassuring imaging and serial exams. However, he continues to experience ongoing encephalopathy and delirium, which is being treated with medications such as methadone, clonidine, and seroquel.

The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now doing well on TC (likely tracheal cuff) for several days. He will continue to receive bronchodilators, suctioning, and use of a nasal cannula when on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient's fever has also resolved, and he no longer requires antibiotics.

The patient's Lyme encephalitis is now being treated off ceftriaxone, as per neurology, and there is no need for repeat lumbar puncture (LP).

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which did not respond to a saline challenge. The etiology is unclear, but there is no present need to attempt to correct it.

The patient has a corneal ulcer, which is being treated per ophthalmology notes.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition consists of receiving Fibers"
