","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, and chronic heart failure who presented to the hospital with poor oral intake, nausea, fatigue, hypotension, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. She has been diagnosed with chronic diastolic heart failure, high pulmonary pressures likely due to left atrial myxoma inflow obstruction, and pre-renal acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 121/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the lungs, a non-displaced posterior wall myocardial infarction, and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Her extremities are warm and well-perfused.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, ASA, imdur, and lasix.

Plan:

1. Continue ASA 325mg.
2. Restart imdur pending SBP stability.
3. Restart Lasix 40mg daily.
4. Monitor and bolus fluids as needed for hypotension.
5. Check labs tomorrow and dose"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, and chronic heart failure who presented with hypotension and acute-on-chronic renal failure. She was found to have diastolic heart failure with elevated pulmonary pressures. Her blood pressure has stabilized with fluid boluses and she is off pressors. She also has hypothyroidism and is on a heart-healthy, low-salt diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening of her renal function.
2. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's pre-renal etiology of acute-on-chronic renal failure needs to be closely monitored for any deterioration in kidney function.
3. Hypotension: Despite initial improvement with fluid boluses, the patient's hypotension needs to be monitored and managed to prevent further episodes.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires ongoing management with home medication and regular follow-up.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis: As the patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobilization in the ICU, prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is recommended.
6. Nutritional Support: Given the patient's poor oral intake, nutritional support may be necessary to ensure adequate caloric intake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of cardiovascular issues and is currently on prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention. The patient's vital signs indicate a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, the patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is slightly elevated at 16 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input of 3,140 mL with an output of 635 mL through urine and 270 mL through blood products. This indicates adequate hydration but may suggest a potential risk for fluid overload.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there is a slight elevation in creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The troponin-T levels are within normal range, suggesting no ongoing myocardial infarction.

The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in potassium and magnesium levels. The blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 98%. The ABG results are not mentioned in the progress note.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's hypotension, along with the elevated CVP, could indicate a possible cardiac issue or inadequate fluid resuscitation. The positive fluid balance raises concern for fluid overload, which may lead to"

- The patient is well-appearing and comfortable with no signs of distress.
- Physical examination reveals clear lungs, a non-displaced posterior myocardial infarction (PMI), regular rhythm without murmurs, good air movement, and warm lower extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, magnesium, and calcium.
- The patient's echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular function and evidence of high filling pressures consistent with diastolic heart failure.
- The patient's condition has improved with fluid boluses and is now off pressors.
