   # RHYTHM:  Patient with multiple recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no
   EKG of VT in records or EPS performed at OSH.  Unclear if patient
   symptomatic during episodes.  Per records, some attempt at ablation,
   but aborted [**2-10**] to hypoxia/hypotension.  Patient currently in
   A-sense/V-paced rhythm.  Was transfered on amioderone/lidocaine gtt.
   Only PVC's on telemetry since admission.  Poor LV lead placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and an implanted biventricular (BIV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient experienced multiple recurrent VT episodes and ICD firings, but no electrocardiogram (EKG) of VT or electrophysiological study (EPS) performed. The patient is currently in an A-sense/V-paced rhythm due to poor LV lead placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2 rectally, blood pressure of 88/52 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic.

Physical examination findings include a displaced right precordial motion index (PMI), paradoxically split second heart sound (S2), and an early initiated blowing murmur loudest at the apex. There are no thrills or lifts. The patient has trace upper extremity edema, no pre-tibial edema, and a possibly infected papule in the left upper extremity.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.0 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of"

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICD) due to recurrent VT and ICD firings. On admission, he was started on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions. The patient's temperature spiked to 101.2 degrees rectally, and he was deversed with Tylenol. He is currently in an A-sense/V-paced rhythm and has been on amiodarone since admission. His blood pressure is low at 88/52 mmHg, and his heart rate is within normal limits at 72 beats per minute. The patient appears uncomfortable and is moaning in pain. There are no signs of chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and his lungs are clear. He has trace upper extremity edema but no pre-tibial edema. His right pupil is reactive and round, but his left pupil is deviated outward and anisocoric. His blood glucose level is elevated at 103 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT). He experienced episodes of NSVT while asymptomatic, and VSS was performed. Lidocaine was administered, but the patient continued to have runs of VT. Amiodarone was started as a bolus and continuous infusion.
- The patient's pacemaker was interrogated, showing that both leads are functioning, and no evidence of atrial fibrillation was found. However, it is unclear if the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
- The patient's chest X-ray revealed retrocardiac opacity consistent with pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were initiated, but culture data showed no growth.
- The patient's allergies include codeine, Demerol (Oral), and unknown. His last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 88 bpm (range 70-92), blood pressure 107/57 mmHg (range 69-111/72-80), respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute (range 16-30), and oxygen saturation 91% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis, appears uncomfortable, and moaning in pain. He is oriented x3, with mood and affect appropriate. Right pupil reactive and large, left pupil small and non-reactive, anisocoria, conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, no xanthalesma, supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm, laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1, paradoxically split S2, + S4, early initiated blowing murmur loudest at apex, no thrills or lifts, no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, unlabored respirations, no accessory muscle use, no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi, soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, no abdominal bruits, trace upper extremity edema, no pretibial edema, and possibly infected papule in left upper extremity, left lower extremity slightly cool.
- The patient's pulses are as follows: right carotid 2+, right femoral 2+, right popliteal 1+, diminished dorsalis pedis (DP), left carotid 2+, left femoral 2+, left popliteal 1+, diminished DP.
- Lab results show a white blood cell count of 16."

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with ventricular tachycardia (VT). He presented with recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no EKG of VT was available. The patient's left ventricular (LV) lead was turned off due to ineffective location and left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG. He is currently in A-sense/V-paced rhythm and being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine infusions.

The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions, mild bibasilar atelectasis, and increased airspace opacity involving both lungs, which is consistent with pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. Blood cultures/urine cultures are pending.

The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but he has a markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, indicating hypothyroidism. His lipid profile is abnormal, and he is on simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He also has a history of anxiety and/or altered mental status, for which he was on benzodiazepines at the other hospital.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)/ventricular tachycardia (VT) on amiodarone. He presented with VT and ICD firings to an outside hospital (OSH) and was transferred for further care. The patient has recurrent VT episodes, and an electrophysiology (EP) study and ablation were planned. He also has pneumonia in the right lower lobe (RLL) and small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's lead placement on the left ventricle (LV) was abnormal, so it has been turned off. He is currently in atrioventricular (A-V) paced rhythm with frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). His blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures are negative. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and he is being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for his infection. His medication regimen includes carvedilol, spironolactone, lasix, and amiodarone. Further tests and procedures are planned, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), cardiac catheterization, and potential ablation. The patient's"

   ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior,
   inferolateral and lateral walls, as well as the distal [**1-11**] of the
   ventricle. Anterior and septal wall function is relatively preserved,
   though not normal (LVEF = 20-25%). The right ventricular cavity is
   mildly dilated with severe focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall,
   and milder hypokinesis of the rest of the free wall. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is bileaflet systolic tenting,
   secondary to LV dilatation and chordal tension. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. A slightly eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
   moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with an inferobasal LV aneurysm and
   severe regional systolic dysfunction. Regional right ventricular
   dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)/intracranial device (ICD) with ineffective left ventricular (LV) lead. The patient presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ICD firings to an outside hospital (OSH). He was transferred for further care.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. He had an attempted VT ablation that could not induce rhythm during the procedure. He was extubated post-procedure but then reintubated due to respiratory difficulties, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) as seen on chest X-ray. He also developed hypotension, which is unclear in origin but may be secondary to infection or cardiogenic shock. The patient has had a fever spike of 102°F and worsening leukocytosis and left shift. His blood cultures have shown no growth to date.

The patient's medical history includes idiopathic CM, CHF, reported biventricular ICD/ICD, VT, and ICD firings. He has been on amiodarone and lidocaine but is currently on PO amiodarone and IV lidocaine. The LV lead has been deactivated. The patient's medications include carvedilol, spironolactone, and lasix, and"

   mildly dilated with severe focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall,
   and milder hypokinesis of the rest of the free wall. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is bileaflet systolic tenting,
   secondary to LV dilatation and chordal tension. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. A slightly eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
   moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with an inferobasal LV aneurysm and
   severe regional systolic dysfunction. Regional right ventricular
   dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT) on amiodarone. He presented with VT and ICD firings to an outside hospital (OSH), and was transferred for further care. The patient has severe regional biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). There is also evidence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient's right ventricular (RV) lead is currently disabled, but will be reactivated. He is being treated with IV lasix, carvedilol, spironolactone, and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and evidence of poor systemic perfusion suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of recurrent VT and ICD firings indicate an increased risk for future episodes of VT, which can be potentially fatal if not promptly treated.
3. Pneumonia: The worsening left lower lobe opacification on chest X-ray suggests"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 74 y/o male with a hx of idopathic CM, CHF w/ reported BIV/ICD/
   VT on amioderone, p/w VT and ICD firings to an OSH, now transfered for
   further care.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient denies history of MI or CP, and no hx of CAD per
   OSH records.  Will try to tease out more history from PCP on friday.
   .
   # PUMP:  Per report, hx of idiopathic CM, unknown EF.  Patient
   currently euovelemic on exam, with no impressive LE edema, no fluid
   overload on CXR, CVP at 7cm.  Patient with severe regional
   biventricular dysfunction with EF of 20% on TTE.  Also with 3+ MR and
   2+ AR.  Patient has Biv-ICD, but with an ineffective LV lead now
   disabled.  Patient with cold extremities, with evidence of poor
   systolic function.  Patient given 20mg and 60mg of IV lasix yesterday
   with 1.5 L of urine output.  Reportedly even for the day, but may be
   inaccurate.
   - cont home regimen of [**Last Name (un) **], Carvedilol, Spironolactone, an lasix (may
   need larger IV dose in cath lab intake was larger).  Will hold morning
   doses in the secondary to hypotension.
   - hold digoxin in setting of VT
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient with multiple recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no
   EKG of VT in records or EPS performed at OSH.  Unclear if patient
   symptomatic during episodes.  Per records, some attempt at ablation,
   but aborted [**2-10**] to hypoxia/hypotension.  Patient currently in
   A-sense/V-paced rhythm.  Was transfered on amioderone/lidocaine gtt.
   Had frequent NSVT after stopping lidocaine, with patern suggesting left
   posterolateral origin, likely more epicardial focus.  Despite
   infection, VT ablation performed yesterday due to concern of stability
   over weekend.  Patient always ATP paced out of rhythm.  Could not
   induce arrhythmia on endocaridal ablation, and only a few lesions
   made.
   - cont amio, but switched to PO
   - cont lidocaine
   - likely epicardial mapping and possible repeat ablation on monday
   - unclear why patient was on coumadin, no evidence of AF on
   interrogation in last month, will clarify on Monday with cardiologist
   - deactivated LV lead
   .
   # Fever:  Patient with temp of 102 again yesterday.  Improving
   leukocytosis and left shift, which was attributed to stress at OSH.
   Likely PNA, as seen in RLL on CXR with slight worsening.  UA
   unremarkable, and BCX no growth to date.  Sputum Cx without grown.  On
   vanc/zosyn, day [**3-19**].  Patient had to be re-intubated post-procedure.
   - CIS
   - cont vanc/zosyn, but will downgrade tomorrow if cultures remain
   negative
   - f/u CXs
   - tylenol PRN
   - send repeat sputum culture while intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory difficulties:  Patient had a PNA prior to intubation, but
   had been oxygenating well, although was slightly tachypnic.  After
   extubation, did not oxygenate well, requiring re-intubation.  Worsening
   of PNA on CXR.
   -cont vac/zosyn
   - ween vent over course of the day.
   .
   #Hypotension: Unclear why new hypotension.  Most likely secondary to
   infection.  While may be due to sedation, has worsened since going down
   on medications.  Not significantly fluid up to suggest worsened heart
   failure. No pulsus, muffled heart sounds, elevated JVP, to suggest
   tamponade post procedure.  Pressures improved with fluid bolus.
   -          cont to monitor, start vasopressin (less arrythmogenic) if
   pressures cont to be low.
   -          Hold BP and diuretic meds
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Patient with markedly elevated TSH at OSH.  Normal
   here.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  will cont lipitor
   .
   # Anxiety/?AMS:  Patient on benzo's at OSH.  While appears anxious,
   unclear if MS altered from baseline.
   - hold anxietolytics for now
   - will check lytes, LFts, CBC
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator/pacemaker (ICD/P) with ventricular tachycardia (VT). He presented with recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no electrocardiogram (EKG) of VT in records or electrophysiological study (EPS) performed at the other hospital. The patient is currently in atrioventricular-sense (A-sense)/ventricular-paced (V-paced) rhythm. He had frequent nonsustained VT after stopping lidocaine, with a pattern suggesting left posterolateral origin, likely more epicardial focus. Despite infection, VT ablation was performed yesterday due to concern over the weekend's stability. The patient could not be induced into rhythm during the procedure, and only a few lesions were made.

The patient has been experiencing fever with a temperature of 102 degrees again yesterday, improving leukocytosis and left shift, which was attributed to stress at the other hospital. He likely has pneumonia (PNA), as evidenced by worsening left lower lobe opacification on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's urine output has been decreasing, and he is oliguric. He required reintubation post-procedure. He has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected pneumonia, but his sputum culture remains negative.

The patient had respiratory difficulties prior to intubation, but was oxygenating well. After extubation, he did not oxygenate well, requiring re-intubation. His worsening PNA on CXR is a concern. His blood cultures are negative.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. His heart sounds are muffled, and his jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac tamponade post-procedure. Pressures improved with a fluid bolus. His medication regimen includes amiodarone, lidocaine, carvedilol, spironolactone, and lasix. His digoxin will be held in the setting of VT. He is also on aspirin and atorvastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of recurrent VT, and it has been a concern for his stability. VT ablation was attempted but could not be induced during the procedure.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient likely has pneumonia, as evidenced by fever, leukocytosis, left shift, and worsening left lower lobe opacification on CXR. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), but his sputum culture remains negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. He presented with VT and ICD firings and was transferred for further care. On admission, he was intubated due to hypoxia and hypotension during an attempted VT ablation procedure. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a medical history. He has been on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions, and an NG tube was placed. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 101.8°F, leukocytosis, and left shift, which was initially attributed to stress. There is concern for possible endocarditis with prominent mitral regurgitation. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20-25% with akinesis in the inferior, inferolateral, and lateral walls of the left ventricle (LV), as well as severe focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle (RV). His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. He also has hypothyroidism with a markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.

   or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. [Intrinsic left ventricular
   systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
   valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate
   (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. Severe (4+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   augmented with fluid boluses, arguing for more septic picture.
   However, MR [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] on exam, and with chilled extremities,
   cardiogenic shock also highly considered.
   - cont home regimen of [**Last Name (un) **], Carvedilol, Spironolactone, an lasix (may

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was transferred to the ICU due to VT and ICD firings, and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 115/66 mmHg and heart rate between 65-90 bpm. His respiratory rate is 12-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a history of severe biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). He also has moderate aortic regurgitation and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's LV lead is currently disabled, but will be reactivated and optimized with TTE guidance.

The patient's recent events include optimization of LV lead, improvement in mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet during simultaneous LV pacing, and augmentation of blood pressures with LV pacing. He has also experienced episodes of nonsustained VT and PVCs, for which he is being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine.

The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 x 10^3/mm^3, and elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging shows moderately dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, severely dilated left ventricular cavity with severe regional systolic dysfunction, and mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, but moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation and severe (4+) mitral regurgitation are noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and cold extremities suggest poor systemic perfusion, which may indicate cardiogenic shock due to severe biventricular dysfunction and significant valvular regurgitation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and worsening pneumonia on chest X-ray indicate a possible infectious process, leading to sepsis.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's intubation and sedation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of recurrent VT and ICD firings, and ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient's condition appears complex, with multiple potential medical complications that need close monitoring and appropriate management."

   pacing, with systolics > 100 throughout the day.  Decision was made to
   hold on PA catheter and hemodynamic assessment.
   -- Patients FiO2 decreased to 40% and switched over to pressure
   support, and tolerated well.
   -- amioderone was switched to 400mg PO BID and lidocaine was reduced to
   0.5mg/min, with infrequent PVCs and no NSVT until overnight, where he
   had 2 episodes of NSVT, 12 beats longest in duration, self-broken.
   Potassium was low, and was repleted.  Held off on increasing lidocaine
   back to 1mg/min
   --Did well on PS during the day. RSBI this AM was 82, but with
   significant tachypnea. Placed back on AC
   --Spironolactone, carvedilol, lasix, held secondary to hypotension.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severe regional systolic dysfunction including akinesis of the
   inferolateral and anterolateral walls. Overall LVEF is ~25%. No masses
   or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. [Intrinsic left ventricular
   systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
   valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate
   (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. Severe (4+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 74 y/o male with a hx of idopathic CM, CHF w/ reported BIV/ICD/
   VT on amioderone, p/w VT and ICD firings to an OSH, now transfered for
   further care.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient denies history of MI or CP, and no hx of CAD per
   OSH records.  Will try to tease out more history from PCP.
   .
   # PUMP:  hx of dilated idiopathic CM, but has regional dysfunction on
   TTE, anterolateral and inferolateral akinesis.  Patient with severe
   regional biventricular dysfunction with EF of 20% on TTE.  Also with 3+
   MR and 2+ AR.  Patient has Biv-ICD, and with an ineffective LV lead
   disabled.  Hypotensive [**1-5**] to SBP 80
s, unclear if hypotension was
   due to cardiogenic vs. septic shock.  Underwent EP study [**1-5**] with LV
   lead increased to 7 amps.  Also  reset PPM to DDD-R, with increasing HR
   to 75 to augment CO.    Blood pressure subsequently improved to SBP
   100
s.  Crackles on exam [**1-6**], with bilateral upper extremity 3+
   edema.  Will restart lasix, continuing to hold spironolactone, and
   carvedilol.
   -Lasix 60mg IV
   -goal output 1000cc

   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient with multiple recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no
   EKG of VT in records or EPS performed at OSH.  Unclear if patient
   symptomatic during episodes.  Per records, some attempt at ablation,
   but aborted [**2-10**] to hypoxia/hypotension.  Was transfered on
   amioderone/lidocaine gtt.  Had frequent NSVT after stopping lidocaine,
   with pattern suggesting left posterolateral origin, likely more
   epicardial focus.  Patient always ATP paced out of rhythm.  Despite
   infection, VT ablation performed yesterday due to concern of stability
   over weekend.  Could not induce arrhythmia on endocaridal ablation.
   Lidocaine weaned down to .5mg/min [**1-5**].  Had two runs of NSVT
   overnight, K was repleted.
   - cont amiodarone at 400mg PO BID
   - discontinue lidocaine
   - start mexilitine 150mg PO TID
   - patient unlikely to tolerate epicardial mapping and possible repeat
   ablation at this time
   - unclear why patient was on coumadin, no evidence of AF on
   interrogation in last month, will clarify with cardiologist
   - hold digoxin in setting of VT
   .
   # PNA:  Patient with history of fever and leukocytosis, b/l infiltrates
   on CXR  On vanc/zosyn, day [**4-19**].  Patient had to be re-intubated
   post-procedure.
   - CIS
   - cont vanc/zosyn [**4-19**]
   - f/u CXs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Respiratory Status:  Patient had a PNA prior to intubation, but had
   been oxygenating well, although was slightly tachypnic.  After
   extubation, did not oxygenate well, requiring re-intubation.  Worsening
   of PNA on CXR.  RSBI 82 but very tachypneic. Bilateral crackles on exam
   [**1-6**], was 1L positive over 24 hours.  Will diurese today 1L, rest on
   AC, attempt extubation [**1-7**].
   -cont vac/zosyn for pneumonia
   - lasix 60mg IV, diurese goal negative 1L.
   .
   #Hypotension: Septic vs. cardiogenic shock.   Pressures improved with
   fluid bolus, and increasing LV lead to 7 amps, increasing HR to 75.
   BP meds were held [**1-5**].  Will continue to hold carvedilol and
   spironolactone [**1-6**].
   -Hold spironolactone and carvedilol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Patient with markedly elevated TSH at OSH.  Normal
   here.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  will cont lipitor
   .
   # Anxiety/?AMS:  Patient on benzo's at OSH.  While appears anxious,
   unclear if MS altered from baseline, if so, may be secondary to
   infection vs. lidocaine toxicity.  Patient now sedated for intubation

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and an implanted biventricular (BIV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient presented to the hospital with multiple recurrent VT and ICD firings but no electrocardiogram (EKG) of VT in records or electrophysiological study (EPS) performed at the outside hospital. 

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes hypotension, severe biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and moderate aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient underwent an EP study with left ventricular (LV) lead adjustment, increasing the LV lead to 7 amps, and resetting the pacemaker to DDD-R mode to augment cardiac output. Blood pressure subsequently improved to systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100mmHg.

The patient also has bilateral upper extremity edema and crackles on examination, indicating possible fluid overload. The patient is currently on amiodarone/gentamicin (amidated) and lidocaine infusions, but frequent non-sustained VT (NSVT) episodes occurred after stopping lidocaine. VT ablation was performed due to concern over the patient's stability over the weekend, but the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with ineffective left ventricular (LV) lead. The patient presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ICD firings, which were initially thought to be secondary to an overdose of amiodarone. However, further evaluation revealed that the hypotension was not due to cardiogenic or septic shock but rather ineffective LV lead. The LV lead was increased to 7 amps, and the patient's blood pressure improved.

The patient also has a history of pneumonia, for which he is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. He required reintubation due to worsening respiratory status and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist/autoflow mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 32, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, and plateau pressure (Pplat) of 19 cmH2O. The patient's oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and his blood gases show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 455.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral upper extremity edema and crackles on examination. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 98/55 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.9 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.2 mEq/L, and glucose level of 93 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension (not shock), pneumonia (hospital-acquired), cardiomyopathy (other), and fever (unknown origin). Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, cardiogenic shock, worsening respiratory distress, and further episodes of VT."

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), biventricular pacing (BIV)/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)/ventricular tachycardia (VT), transferred for further care. He has severe regional biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), along with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient's lead was ineffective, but it was increased to 7 amps after an electrophysiological (EP) study. The patient's blood pressure improved to 100 systolic after resetting the pacemaker to DDD-R mode with an increasing heart rate to 75 to augment cardiac output.

The patient also has a history of fever and leukocytosis, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and is currently on vancomycin (VAN)/piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for pneumonia (PNA). He required reintubation due to poor oxygenation. His respiratory status is worsening, with a recent increase in positive fluid balance. The patient has crackles on examination, indicating fluid overload. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   symptomatic during episodes.  Per records, some attempt at ablation,
   but aborted [**2-10**] to hypoxia/hypotension.  Was transfered on
   amioderone/lidocaine gtt.  Had frequent NSVT after stopping lidocaine,
   with pattern suggesting left posterolateral origin, likely more
   epicardial focus.  Patient always ATP paced out of rhythm.  Despite
   infection, VT ablation performed yesterday due to concern of stability
   over weekend.  Could not induce arrhythmia on endocaridal ablation.
   Lidocaine weaned down to .5mg/min [**1-5**].  Had two runs of NSVT
   overnight, K was repleted.
   - cont amiodarone at 400mg PO BID
   - discontinue lidocaine
   - start mexilitine 150mg PO TID
   - patient unlikely to tolerate epicardial mapping and possible repeat

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
- The patient presented with ventricular tachycardia and ICD firings, but no EKG of VT was recorded. An attempt at ablation was made, but it was aborted due to hypoxia/hypotension.
- The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
- The patient has a severe regional biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
- The patient also has moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and moderate aortic regurgitation (AR).
- The patient was previously on amiodarone and lidocaine, but these medications were discontinued and replaced with mexilitine due to frequent NSVT episodes.
- The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was acquired during hospitalization (hospital-acquired pneumonia).
- The patient required reintubation after experiencing worsening respiratory symptoms and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. The cause of hypotension is unclear, as it could be due to septic"

   # Respiratory Status:  Patient had a PNA prior to intubation, but had
   been oxygenating well, although was slightly tachypnic.  After
   extubation, did not oxygenate well, requiring re-intubation.  Worsening
   of PNA on CXR.  RSBI 82 but very tachypneic. Bilateral crackles on exam
   [**1-6**], was 1L positive over 24 hours.  Diuresed well to IV Lasix bolus
   yesterday, with improved lung sounds and aeration on exam today.
   - transition from AC to PS ventilation, attempt SBT and extubation
   today
   .
   #Hypotension: Septic vs. cardiogenic shock.   Pressures improved with
   fluid bolus, and increasing LV lead to 7 amps, increasing HR to 75.
   BP meds were held [**1-5**].  BP improved and stabilized after resumption
   of Lasix.
   - continue home doses of carvedilol, spironolactone, and Lasix
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Patient with markedly elevated TSH at OSH.  Normal
   here.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  will cont lipitor
   .
   # Anxiety/?AMS:  Patient on benzo's at OSH.  While appears anxious,
   unclear if MS altered from baseline, if so, may be secondary to
   infection vs. lidocaine toxicity.
   - lighten sedation for extubation
   - reassess post-extubation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient experienced VT and ICD firings before being transferred to the hospital for further care.

The patient has severe biventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), as well as moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and mild aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient also has bilateral upper extremity edema and crackles on exam, suggesting fluid overload. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) study with increased output from the left ventricular lead and reset pacemaker mode to DDD-R to improve cardiac output.

The patient has recurrent VT and ICD firings, but no electrocardiogram (EKG) of VT or EP study performed at the outside hospital. VT ablation was attempted, but aborted due to hypoxia/hypotension. The patient is currently on amiodarone and mexilitine for rhythm control.

The patient also has pneumonia (PNA) with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, for which he is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient required reintub"
