The patient received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse INR for ERCP today. His vital signs are stable with a MAP ranging from 76-81 and no pressor requirement. The patient has a history of receiving antibiotics, specifically meropenem and ciprofloxacin, on [**2115-5-26**] at 10:30 PM and 11:00 PM respectively.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild abdominal pain and right upper quadrant pain. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F) with a maximum temperature recorded at 37.2°C (98.9°F) and a current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F). The patient's heart rate is 64 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 62-74 bpm. Blood pressure readings range from 118/61 mmHg to 119/70 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 10 breaths per minute with a range of 10-22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 95% and the patient is on room air. The patient's rhythm is junctional.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with non-operable pancreatic cancer who has undergone biliary stenting and is now presenting with cholangitis. The patient received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the elevated INR for an upcoming endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/61 mmHg to 119/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a junctional rhythm, and the abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 140, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has cholangitis based on the history of non-operable pancreatic cancer, indwelling biliary stents, elevated white blood cell count, hypotension, and suspected Gram-negative bacterial septicemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem + c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of inoperable pancreatic cancer and a stent. He was transferred from another hospital with cholangitis and is awaiting an ERCP procedure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/57 to 119/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress noted during the physical examination. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but within normal ranges for creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient has a history of GNR bacteremia from previous cultures and is currently on ciprofloxacin, which will be changed to zosyn for hospital-acquired bowel/gn coverage. The patient's conditions include cholangitis, hypotension, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus with surgical site infection. The patient is NPO pending ERCP and will receive regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on 05/26/2115. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and ventilator-associated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with non-operable pancreatic cancer who presented with cholangitis after biliary stenting. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure to change the stent and remove an existing one due to pus and dilated CBD. Blood cultures showed E. coli sensitivity to Zosyn, so a seven-day course of Zosyn was administered. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an SpO2 of 99%. His vital signs are stable, but he exhibits mild epigastric pain. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and normal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, and electrolyte levels are also within normal range. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not promptly treated. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Pancreatic Cancer: The patient has inoperable pancreatic cancer, which may cause pain and complications related to tumor progression.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac complications such as stroke or arrhythmias.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored for glycemic control, as hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
5. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): BPH can cause urinary retention, especially in the context of a Foley catheter. Monitoring the patient's urinary output and adjusting the management of BPH accordingly is important.
6. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but close monitoring is still required due to potential nephrotoxicity from medications or complications related to sepsis or cholangitis.
7. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory distress or failure. Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation parameters, as well as weaning trials, is crucial for the patient's respiratory status.

It is important to regularly assess and manage these potential complications to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with non-operable pancreatic cancer who has been experiencing cholangitis following an ERCP procedure to change his biliary stent. The patient has a history of antibiotic use, including ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/79 mmHg to 158/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on a ventilator with an ABG showing pH of 7.20. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds with crackles bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 140 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and slightly low calcium level of 7.3 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and cardiac enzymes are normal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of inoperable pancreatic cancer and cholangitis. He was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure, where a new stent was placed and an old stent was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and showed improvement overnight. He has a history of bacteremia caused by E. coli, which has been treated with a 7-day course of Zosyn. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 132/79 mmHg to 158/86 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 96%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.20. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of cholangitis and recent ERCP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by E. coli, which has been treated with antibiotics. However, there is still a risk of infection due to the invasive nature of the ERCP procedure.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially experienced hypotension, which was resolved with IV fluids. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is necessary to ensure the patient remains hemodynamically stable.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has atrial fibrillation and requires anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is"
