   # Hypotension: Ddx GI bleed v. infectious etiology.
   - EGD today
   # GI Bleed: Per report, had BM in ED that was dark and strongly guaic
   positive.  That with the combination of hypotension concerning for
   significant bleed.  Hct on presentation at 30, with an unknown
   baseline.  Report prior cscope 2 years prior w/o abnormalities.  Had

   contributing etiologies, without signs of infection.  UA negative, no
   fever, no leukocytosis.
   - TSH low, will check free T4
   - trend hct
   - will notify pt's neurologist that she is in house and see if they
   want her seen during hospitalizaiton by neurology service.  Has not
   been seen in 3 years.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). She was admitted to the MICU with complaints of weakness and concern of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 72 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates a total input of 5,397 mL with a total output of 5,135 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.9 thousand/mm³, hematocrit (Hct) of 28.8%, platelet (Plt) count of 243 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and lactate level of 0.5 mmol/L. Imaging studies reveal transverse colon thickening, but the etiology is uncertain.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: Intermittent symptomatic hypotension is likely due to an infectious etiology or autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS. The patient is being monitored with levophed as needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with a history of secondary progressive MS who come
   in with complaints of 6 months of weakness, admitted to the MICU with
   concern of GI Bleed.
   .
   # Hypotension: Intermittent symptomatic hypotensive episodes. Likely
   not [**3-7**] GI bleed as evidence of this and Hct stable after transfusion.
   Most likely due to infectious etiology though autonomic dysfunction in
   setting of MS is a possible dx of exclusion.
   - Monitor BP with levophed prn to maintain MAP
   - F/u pending cx
   - CIS
   - Monitor Hct
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - Will call Neuro outpatient attg and possible Neuro c/s regarding
   question of autonomic instability
   # GI Bleed: Per report, had BM in ED that was dark and strongly guaic
   positive.  That with the combination of hypotension concerning for
   significant bleed.  Hct on presentation at 30, with an unknown
   baseline.  Report prior cscope 2 years prior w/o abnormalities.  Had
   negative NG lavage.  Stable Hct overnight suggests this is not etiology
   of ongoing hypotension.
   - F/u GI recs; hold off on EGD for now
   - will follow q12 Hct
   - cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], RIJ in place, T&S x 4 units and transfuse for Hct
   <25, NPO for now
   .
   # Transverse colon thickening: Ischemic v. infectious v. inflammatory.
   Pt with mild epigastric tenderness but lactate nl
   - Discuss significance of finding with GI
   - Trend lactate and abdominal exam
   .
   #  Weakness: Does not appear from description of symptoms that her
   presenting complaints related to GI bleed.  Given coplicated neurologic
   history, complaints of muscle wekaness and confusion would seem more
   the consequence of her MS than that of GI bleed with stable hct or
   hypoprofusion from hypotension.  No prominent evidence of other
   contributing etiologies, without signs of infection.  UA negative, no
   fever, no leukocytosis. Tox screen negative
   - TSH low, will check free T4
   - trend hct
   - F/u cx
   - will notify pt's neurologist that she is in house and see if they
   want her seen during hospitalization by neurology service.  Has not
   been seen in 3 years.
   - will hold provigil for now
   .
   # MS: Again, will d/w pt's outpatient neurologist and clarify if they
   feel a consult is needed.
   - cont baclofen
   - cont amitriptilene, copaxone, tizanidine
   - cont keppra, but unclear why pt is on medication, and will need to
   clarify.
   .
   # Renal failure: Now resolved, likely prerenal
   - hold etodolac and lisinopril for now
   .
   # Hypertension: hold lisinopril/hctz given presenting hypotension
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: check T4, cont synthroid for now
   .
   # Constipation: Some degree of autonomic dystregulation in setting of
   MS.  cont bowel regimen
 pt on standing suppository at home.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont zocor and holding baby aspirin

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who was admitted to the MICU with complaints of weakness and concern for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She is currently being treated for several conditions, including hypotension, potential autonomic dysfunction, GI bleed, transverse colon thickening, weakness, MS, renal failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, constipation, and hyperlipidemia.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's hypotension is not likely due to a GI bleed as evidenced by stable hemoglobin (Hct) levels after transfusion. It is likely caused by an infectious etiology or autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS.
- The patient had a positive guaiac-positive black and tarry stool in the emergency department, but her Hct has remained stable overnight, suggesting that this is not the cause of ongoing hypotension.
- The patient's transverse colon thickening is being discussed with the GI team, and lactate levels are being trended along with abdominal exams.
- The patient's weakness does not appear to be related to the GI bleed or hypotension. It may be a consequence of her MS. No prominent evidence of other contributing etiologies has been found.
- The patient's renal failure has now resolved, likely due to prerenal causes.
- The patient's hypertension has been managed by holding lisinopril/hctz given her presenting hypotension.
- The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with synthetic thyroid hormone replacement, and her TSH level is low.
- The patient's constipation may be due to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS. Her bowel regimen is being continued.
- The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with zocor, and baby aspirin is being held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Autonomic Dysfunction: The patient's intermittent symptomatic hypotensive episodes may be due to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS. This condition can lead to orthostatic hypotension, which may result in falls and injuries.
2. GI Bleed: Although the patient's Hct levels have remained stable overnight, there is still a concern for ongoing GI bleed. This can lead to significant blood loss and potentially require blood transfusions.
3. Infection: The patient's symptoms of weakness and confusion could also be due to an infection, particularly in the context of MS where fever may be an early sign of infection.
4. Transverse Colon Thickening: The thickening of the transverse colon wall could be indicative of ischemic changes, which can lead to bowel ischemia and necrosis if not appropriately managed.

Further evaluation and management are needed for the patient's conditions, including ongoing monitoring of vital signs, trend lactate levels, follow-up cultures, and communication with the neurology team regarding possible autonomic instability and MS progression."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with complaints of weakness and was admitted to the MICU with concerns of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been experiencing intermittent symptomatic hypotensive episodes, which are likely not due to GI bleed as evidenced by stable hematocrit (Hct) levels after transfusion. The most likely cause of hypotension is infectious etiology, although autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS is a possible diagnosis of exclusion.

The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible transverse colon thickening, which could be ischemic, infectious, or inflammatory. Further evaluation and discussion with the gastroenterology team are needed to determine the significance of this finding.

The patient has also been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by enterococcus and gram-positive cocci. The current antibiotic regimen should cover these organisms unless vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is suspected. Sensitivities and further antibiotic adjustments will be made as able.

The patient's weakness does not appear to be related to the GI bleed or hypotension. It is more likely a consequence of her MS, exacerbated by a possible UTI and poor neurological reserve. Monitoring Hct levels, following up on cultures, and arranging an outpatient neurological appointment will be important in managing her weakness.

The patient's MS is now resolving after treatment of acute myelopathy syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who was admitted to the MICU with complaints of weakness and concern of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotensive episodes, which are likely not due to GI bleed as evidenced by stable hematocrit levels since transfusion. The hypotension is most likely caused by an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), considering other cultures are negative. The patient also has a history of autonomic dysfunction, which may contribute to her lower blood pressure reserves. 

The patient had a positive guaiac test for blood in the stool, suggesting a possible GI bleed, but this is not supported by negative nasogastric lavage and stable hematocrit levels. There is also evidence of transverse colon thickening on imaging, which could be due to ischemia, infection, or inflammation. 

The patient's urine culture showed the presence of enterococcus and streptococcus viridans. Ampicillin was started for a 10-day course to treat the UTI. 

The patient's symptoms of weakness do not appear to be related to the GI bleed. Instead, they are more likely attributed to her MS and poor neurological reserve, possibly exacerbated by a UTI. 

The patient is resolving acute mental status changes (AMS) associated with her MS, and her renal failure has resolved, likely due to prerenal causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with complaints of weakness, confusion, and hypotension. She was admitted to the MICU with concerns of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's medical history includes a previous colonoscopy that was normal, a recent episode of shingles affecting the right side of her face, chronic weakness, and hypothyroidism. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several medical complications. She had intermittent symptomatic hypotensive episodes, which were initially thought to be due to a GI bleed. However, the stable hematocrit (Hct) levels since transfusion and the presence of enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) suggest that the hypotension is more likely related to the UTI rather than the GI bleed. Autonomic dysfunction in the setting of MS may also contribute to the hypotension.

The patient also had an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, which was likely ketosis from being nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status. This resolved with intravenous fluids and the patient tolerating a regular diet.

Additionally, the patient had evidence of a transverse colon thickening, which was more consistent with ischemic causes rather than infectious or inflammatory etiologies. The patient's lactate levels were normal, suggesting that there was no ongoing hypoperfusion.

The patient's urine culture showed enterococcus and strep virid"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who was admitted to the MICU with complaints of weakness and concerns of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
2. The patient experienced intermittent symptomatic hypotensive episodes, which are not likely due to a GI bleed as evidenced by stable hematocrit (Hct) levels since transfusion. Instead, the hypotension is likely caused by an enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), considering other cultures were negative.
3. The patient also had an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, which was resolved with intravenous fluids and the patient is now tolerating oral intake.
4. The patient had a reported bloody stool that was guaiac positive, suggesting a possible GI bleed. However, the stable Hct levels suggest this is not the cause of ongoing hypotension.
5. The patient had transverse colon thickening seen on imaging, which is more consistent with ischemic changes rather than infection or inflammation. This could be related to hypoperfusion in the setting of infection, given the patient's low reserve.
6. The patient had a positive enterococcus urine culture along with a low count of Strep viridans. Treatment with ampicillin for a 10-day course has been initiated.
