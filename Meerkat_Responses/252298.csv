   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Acute decompensation of chronic
   hypercarbic resp failure, now s/p intubation. Probable progression of
   GVHD, however need to rule out. His acute decompensation can be
   secondary to mucus plug, infection/sepsis, bronchospasm.  CTA w/o
   evidence of PE and head CT w/o evidence of primary central process to
   explain acute decompensation. CXR w/o evidence of flash pulm edema.
   Bronchoscopy notable for plugs, sputum sent for cultures. Probably
   being overventilated as PC02 of 40, whereas baseline in 60s.
   - Reduce respiratory rate and/or tidal volume

   - F/u on sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia
   - Pending ruled out infection (if so likely chronic atypical given
   longstanding LLL infiltrate), may benefit from higher dose steroids if
   GVHD related.
   - Daily SBTs, RISBI
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Hypotension.  Normotensive prior to intubation but now with prolonged
   low BPs
 hypovolemia vs positive pressure effect vs. sedation meds vs.
   sepsis (in the setting of fevers).  Patient required pressor support
   (neo) overnight, now off.  Has also been hydrated w/ ivfs. CTA negative
   for PE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He has been experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute decompensation of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure may be secondary to mucus plug, infection/sepsis, bronchospasm, or GVHD-related inflammation. The goal is to reduce respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, monitor ABGs with a target pCO2 of 60s and pH 7.37, and continue HAP therapy with cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Sputum cultures should be followed up, and if infection is ruled out, higher-dose steroids may be beneficial for GVHD-related complications.

2. Hypotension: The patient was normotensive before intubation but now presents with prolonged low blood pressures. Possible causes include hypovolemia, positive pressure effect, sedation medications, sepsis (in the setting of fevers), or a combination of these factors. Pressor support was required overnight, and the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. He required intubation and invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of hypotension, which was managed with pressors. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing LLL consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and acyclovir. He is currently on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3°C, tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm, and stable blood pressure. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but normal hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema, a small left pleural effusion, and moderate intra-abdominal ascites. The patient's current assessment includes hypotension and acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The plan includes ongoing ICU care, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) status post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who has developed multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease. He presented with dyspnea and cough and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, as well as antiviral medication for presumed pneumonia. Bronchoscopy showed mucus plugs, and sputum samples have been sent for culture.

The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) show a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. His lactate levels are elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis. The patient's blood culture results are pending.

The patient has a history of NHL s/p alloBMT and is currently in remission. He also has a history of gastric varices, hypothyroidism, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline from GVHD.

The patient's current medical plan includes daily spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs), respiratory infection scoring index (RISBI), and monitoring of ABGs with a goal partial pressure of carbon"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Acute decompensation of chronic
   hypercarbic resp failure, now s/p intubation. Probable progression of
   GVHD, however need to rule out infectious etiology. His acute
   decompensation can be secondary to mucus plug, infection/sepsis,
   bronchospasm.  CTA w/o evidence of PE and head CT w/o evidence of
   primary central process to explain acute decompensation. CXR w/o
   evidence of flash pulm edema.  Bronchoscopy notable for plugs, sputum
   sent for cultures. Probably being overventilated as PC02 of 40, whereas
   baseline in 60s.
   - Reduce respiratory rate and/or tidal volume
   - Monitor ABGs goal pCO2 ~ 60s, and goal pH 7.37
   - Continue HAP tx w/ cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin for now.
   - F/u on sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia
   - Pending ruled out infection (if so likely chronic atypical given
   longstanding LLL infiltrate), may benefit from higher dose steroids if
   GVHD related.
   - Daily SBTs, RISBI
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Hypotension.  Normotensive prior to intubation but now with prolonged
   low BPs
 hypovolemia vs positive pressure effect vs. sedation meds vs.
   sepsis (in the setting of fevers).  Patient required pressor support
   (neo) overnight, now off.  Has also been hydrated w/ ivfs. CTA negative
   for PE.
   - f/u TTE
   - F/u culture data
   - IVFs as needed, goal of MAP > 60
   .
   # Fever. Fever to 100.9 ([**2-17**]).  Has been on broad spec abx prior to
   transfer.  Also w/ new ascites though abdomen not tense. Lines look

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient presented with dyspnea, cough, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A bronchoscopy showed mucus plugs, and sputum cultures were sent for analysis. The patient has also been febrile and has ascites, likely secondary to portal hypertension from cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to GVHD and recent interventions, there is a high risk of infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the culture results are pending. Additionally, prophylactic measures against ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute decompensation may be due to mucus plugs, infection, bronchospasm, or overventilation. Reducing the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, monitoring ABGs, and continuing HAP treatment are part of the management plan.
3. Hypotension: The patient's prolonged low blood pressure may be attributed to hypovolemia, positive pressure effect, sedation medications, or sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Baseline lung disease from
   bronchiolitis obliterans with CO2 retention, severe restrictive disease
   on PFTs and very low diffusion capacity.  Admitted with pneumonia and
   new left pleural effusion, now s/p full treatment with cefepime and
   levofloxacin with mild general improvement.  However, today with severe
   respiratory compromise and failure leading to intubation.  Events
   leading to decompensation unclear.  Differential includes worsening
   infection, aspiration, bronchospasm, primary CNS process (head bleed),
   PE, respiratory muscle weakness, infection/sepsis or other global
   decompensation (though hemodynamics initially okay).  PE a concerning
   possibilitiy given acuity of change and lack of DVT prophylaxis.  CNS
   process also a concern given some posturing and tremor following
   intubation (though more likely med related).
   Mucus plug
   No PE, flash pulm edema
   Infection
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure as detailed above
   Could potentially be fungal or atypical mycobacterium.
   - PECT now.  Will hold off on empiric treatment for now.
   - Head CT now.
   - Keep intubated on AC while undergoing workup.  ABG and Aline now.
   Goal pCO2 likely in 60-70 range (aim for very slightly acidemic pH
   given chronicity of respiratory acidosis).
   - Will continue treatment for HAP with cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin for
   now.
   - ?benefit from higher dose steroids if GVHD related.
   - Send sputum culture, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Consider eval of left pleural effusion, though small and may be
   difficult.
   - Send viral panel.
   - Likely bronch now that intubated given desire to do as outpatient and
   lack of resolution of symptoms with current regimen for pneumonia
   (though vanc new today).
   .
   # Hypotension.  Normotensive prior to intubation but now with prolonged
   low BPs - ?positive pressure effect vs. sedation meds vs. worsening
   infection vs. obstructive process/PE vs. cardiogenic cause.
   - Repeat ECG (cannot find floor ECG here).
   - TTE.
   - CTA as above.
   - Check lactate.
   - Reculture.
   - Consider stress dose steroids (increase from current 30 mg pred).
   - Neosynephrine via PICC for now, consider change to norepi if
   continues.
   .
   # Tremor.  Occurring on BMT floor prior to events, though ?med effect
   from tacro.  Low suspicion for seizure activity given chronicity and
   with normal mental status prior.
   - Continue to monitor for now.
   - Holding tacro.
   .
   # Edema.  New this admission.  ?Effect of getting IVFs.  Past echos
   within normal limits.
   - Check TTE.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He has multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention.
- He presented with dyspnea and cough and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient received cefepime and levofloxacin for pneumonia, but his respiratory compromise worsened, leading to intubation.
- Possible causes for the respiratory decompensation include worsening infection, aspiration, bronchospasm, primary CNS process, pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory muscle weakness, or infection/sepsis.
- A CT angiography (CTA) showed no evidence of PE but revealed left lower lobe consolidation and abdominal ascites.
- The patient has hypotension, which could be due to positive pressure effect, sedation medications, worsening infection, obstructive process/PE, or cardiogenic cause.
- Other conditions include tremor (possibly related to medication or CNS process), edema (possibly due to IV fluids), elevated liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline from GVHD, hypothyroidism, and gastric varices.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Likely secondary to intravascular voulme
   depletion, BP dropped when intubated on positive pressure.  Now
   resolved with IVFs and neo weaned off this morning.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) ON CHRONIC:  Patient with
   GVHD/BO and chronic LLL infiltrate treated broadly for bacterial
   processes with decompensation, possible mucus plugging vs. him tiring
   out as he had been working hard to breath for a number of days on the
   floor. Bronch yesterday notable for multiple small mucus plugs in LLL.
   Fluid sent for studies bacterial culture, fungal/AFB/modified AFB
   stain, viral/fungal/AFB cultures, and cytology.  Continues
   cefipime/vanco/levofloxicin.
 TREMORS:  Head CT negative. Not clinically consistent with fevers as
   he was responsive and able to follow commands during episodes when not
   sedated.  Will follwo for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various interventions including the placement of a PICC line, invasive ventilation, and an arterial line. A bronchoscopy was also performed. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. They have been treated with multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, acyclovir, cefepime, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/77 mmHg to 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The results of arterial blood gas analysis indicate a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 64 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 1,360 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 30 mEq/L, and base excess of -10 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), presenting with acute decompensation of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of acute decompensation of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory compromise. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support respiratory function.
2. GVHD: The patient's history of multi-organ GVHD increases the risk for ongoing inflammation and damage to various organs, including the lungs. Monitoring and management of GVHD symptoms are crucial to prevent further organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state post-transplantation, there is a significant risk of infection. Antibiotic therapy is being continued, and cultures are being monitored to identify any potential bacterial infections.
4. Abdominal Issues: The patient's tense abdomen may contribute to difficult ventilation. Further evaluation, such as abdominal ultrasound and possible paracentesis, should be considered to assess for any underlying abdominal pathology.
5. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which have responded to intravenous fluids."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to mucus plugging, infection, or bronchospasm. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood gases show a pCO2 of 40, indicating overventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is likely due to mucus plugging, infection, or bronchospasm. He requires intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been normotensive prior to intubation but now presents with low blood pressures. This could be due to hypovolemia, positive pressure effect from mechanical ventilation, sedation medications, or sepsis.
3. Fever: The patient has had a fever of 100.9°F. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and also has new-onset ascites. His lines are clean and dry, but the fever"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies, but no known drug allergies. He has received antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated. Fluid balance is positive with a total input of 2,765 mL and output of 2,175 mL. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and nosocomial infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of infection or deterioration in respiratory status."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. They are sedated and intubated, unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives. They have been monitored closely with vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure on top of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in further deterioration of respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to have hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ damage.
3. Distended Abdomen: The patient's distended abdomen may contribute to the restrictive component of respiratory failure. If not addressed, this could worsen the respiratory distress.
4. Infection: Although all cultures from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have been negative so far, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's compromised immune system. This could potentially lead to pneumonia or other infectious complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures"

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease, leading to acute respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 126/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a mild elevation in leukocyte count and platelet count.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose of 168 mg/dL. Imaging reveals moderate ascites with a largest pocket measuring 13 cm in the right lower quadrant.

The patient's primary diagnoses include respiratory failure due to severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, hypotension (not in shock), and constipation. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, levoflox"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include:
- Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) without any growth, discussed with BMT team, and started on steroids for GVHD.
- Aggressive bowel regimen initiated.
- Some ascites observed on ultrasound but deferred therapeutic paracentesis until improvement with bowel management.

The patient's allergies are unknown, as history was obtained from previous hospital records. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin on 02/19/2162.

Current infusions include midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour and fentanyl (Concentrate) at 50 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nutritional support via tube feeds and pain management.

Flowsheet data as of 02/20/2162 at 08:09 AM shows stable vital signs, including a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/82 to 132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 48.4 kg at admission to 58.3 kg currently.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI) is 233, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O, and plateau pressure is 21 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 255, and ventilation rate (Ve) of 7.2 L/min.

Physical examination reveals a thin and anxious-appearing patient with an endotracheal tube in place. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and mild distention. Extremities show mild edema in both lower extremities, which has improved. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, follow simple commands, and respond to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count within normal range, hemoglobin at 9.0 g/dL, platelet count at 100,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 35 mg/dL, creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL, glucose at 131 mg/dL, sodium at 138 mEq/L, potassium at 4.2 mEq/L, and magnesium at 1.7 mg/dL. Liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, with AST at 67 U/L and ALT at 51 U/L. Imaging studies reveal moderate ascites with a largest pocket measuring 13 cm in the right lower quadrant.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Alteration in elimination related to constipation: Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
2. Hypotension (not in shock): Responded to intravenous fluids. Now normotensive.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Continue mechanical ventilation, BAL cultures have been negative, likely due to progression of GVHD. Increase steroids as discussed with BMT team.
4. Tense abdomen: Abdomen less tense today. Still has not had a bowel movement. Work on bowel movement today. If no improvement, consider paracentesis.
5. Elevated PTT: Likely too high heparin sodium. Decrease heparin sodium to 2500 units tid.
6. Fever: Afebrile now. Continue antibiotics, follow-up culture data.
7. Lower extremity edema: Likely due to FK506. Improved.
8. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p alloBMT: Monitor counts and toxicities. Follow-up with BMT recommendations.
9. GVHD: Continue respiratory steroids. PPx with bactrim DS and acyclovir. Follow-up with BMT recommendations.
10. Elevated LFTs: At baseline from GVHD. Now actually trending down. Continue to monitor.
11. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
12. Gastric varices: Restart beta blockers as normotensive.

ICU care includes nutrition support via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids at 62.5 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained, and various prophylactic measures are in place, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin sodium, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention."

   MICU WEEKEND COVERAGE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   24 hour events
 started steroids after neg BAL and d/w BMT.  Ascites
   unable to be seen well on bedside U/S, no tap.  To PSV this AM.
   T98.6 P70s, BP126/80s, A/C 40%  350x18/PEEP10, Sat 100%
   PSV 18 TV 280-350s.  No evidence of continued expiratory flow.
   Compliance ~20.
   7.4/54/102
   I/O: +300
   Awake alert, NAD.  No new complaints.  Abd feels better than a few days
   ago.
   Thin man in NAD.  RRR S1 S2 lungs CTA ant.  Abd with increased tone,
   +BS.
   No LE edema.
   Labs: WBC 6.7, Plt 95 (stable from yest).  Bicarb 32, Cr 0.3.
   ALT/AST trending down.
   CXR reviewed, stable.
   Meds include: solumedrol 50 IV BID, levoflox, acyclovir, bactrim, vanc,
   cefepime.
   38 y/o with NHL s/p BMT now with LLL pneumonia, GVHD lung, resp
   failure.
   Resp failure due to GVHD lung, though appears much more fibrotic than
   obstructive on vent.  Able to tolerate PSV today, will continue
   antibiotics and steroids and hope for improvement..  Bowel regimen, BM
   and abd decompression may help resp status.  Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now presenting with multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he has been intubated for acute decompensation of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medications include methylprednisolone, cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and acyclovir. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 126/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, his liver function tests (ALT/AST) are elevated but trending down. Other lab values such as blood glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal the presence of moderate ascites with a largest pocket measuring 13 cm in the right lower quadrant. No new growth was observed in the microbiology report.

The assessment and plan include the following:

","The patient is a 67-inch tall and 58.3 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 126/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 255 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%. 

The patient's medical history includes a bone marrow transplant and allergies, although no specific drug allergies are mentioned. The patient has received multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications since admission. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nutritional support through tube feeds and pain management.

Physical examination findings include thinness, anxiety, clear breath sounds, distended abdomen, bilateral lower extremity edema, and no skin changes. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows"

   24 Hour Events:
   -metoprolol restarted at 12.5 mg PO BID
   -lactulose given to encourage bowel movements
   -NIF was only -20 (should be at least 25) suggesting there is some
   restrictive defect preventing normal inspiratory pressures (perhaps
   combination of deconditioning, tight abdomen secondary to constipation,
   and some intrinsic lung defect)
   -Platelets on lower side, if continue to drop consider d/c vanc
   -clarify with GI about whether they want to do imaging study prior to
   extubation (last week they may have wanted ? MR enterography to
   evaluate small bowel) - hem onc feels it would be better to get such a
   study done before extubation b/c it was tricky for him to do it
   previously (couldnt lie still, trouble swallowing contrast)

   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - pCO2 yesterday was 82 on pressure
   support; needed transition to assist with improvement in pCO2 to 55.
   Likely multifactorial secondary to progression of GVHD.  Although Low
   NIF (-20) could be from GVHD likely compounded by tense abdomen
   secondary to constipation and deconditioning.  Also being treated
   empirically for HAP.  Steroids have been increased per BMT 2 d ago.
   - continue methylprednisolone 50mg IV BID
   -Had several BM yesterday in response to laxatives; ensure continued
   bowel regimen to decrease tense abdomen
   -Also has significant ascites on US; can consider therapeutic
   paracentesis to remove fluid
   -Is and Os goal of -500 daily; if not reaching, rebolus with lasix
   -With bowel movements, can repeat NIF, attempt to wean to pressure
   support as tolerated
   - Continue HAP tx w/ cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin pending final
   cultures negative; completes course on [**2-23**].

   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as
   manifestation of GVHD c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices, GI bleeds,
   now appears to have ascites.
   -Would consider therapeutic tap today to improve respiratory status as
   likely is contributing to restrictive defect
   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN (could not
   estimate PA pressures on last echo) or hepatopulmonary disease; if
   still no improvement in respiratory function could re-assess with echo
   to evaluate for PA pressures + bubble study to check for HPS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now presenting with multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/85 mmHg to 168/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 100 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profiles.

Imaging studies reveal a retrocardiac opacity suggestive of pneumonia and increased interstitial markings indicating noncardiogenic edema. An abdominal ultrasound shows"

   24 Hour Events:
   -metoprolol restarted at 12.5 mg PO BID
   -lactulose given to encourage bowel movements
   -NIF was only -20 (should be at least 25) suggesting there is some
   restrictive defect preventing normal inspiratory pressures (perhaps
   combination of deconditioning, tight abdomen secondary to constipation,
   and some intrinsic lung defect)
   -Platelets on lower side, if continue to drop consider d/c vanc
   -clarify with GI about whether they want to do imaging study prior to
   extubation (last week they may have wanted ? MR enterography to
   evaluate small bowel) - hem onc feels it would be better to get such a
   study done before extubation b/c it was tricky for him to do it
   previously (couldnt lie still, trouble swallowing contrast)

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and has severe baseline lung disease with CO2 retention. The patient presents with dyspnea and cough, and his pCO2 levels have been elevated (82) on pressure support. He is being treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and steroids have been increased per BMT recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's high pCO2 levels indicate respiratory failure, likely secondary to progression of GVHD. Factors contributing to this may include tense abdomen due to constipation, deconditioning, and restrictive lung defect.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has gastric varices, which could lead to GI bleeding. This is a concern due to portal hypertension as a manifestation of GVHD.
3. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: Given the patient's liver disease and ascites, hepatopulmonary syndrome is a potential complication that could contribute to worsening respiratory status.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for HAP, and there is an increased retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient has an elevated PTT, indicating a potential risk for thrombotic events"

   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN (could not

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 11717**]
s above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events:
   Bowel regimen increased, now with good stool output.
   Changed from PSV to A/C after PCO2 to 82 in setting of decreased MV and
   somnolence, no apparent dyspnea / tachypnea.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] of -20, checked x2
   Given additional lasix to run I/O negative.
   This AM, no new complaints.  Breathing comfortable, though complains of
   tube being uncomfortable.  Abd feels slightly better than yesterday.
   VS: T98.3, P70-100, BP100-160/80-100 on 100% A/C 350x18 / 40% / 10.
   I/O: -400cc
   Exam notable for very thin man in NAD, RRR S1 S2, lungs with few
   crackles posteriorly, abd tone still increased, +BS, no LE edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 6.5, Hct 28, Plt 89.  Bicarb 35.
   CXR reviewed with increased interstitial markings (stable),
   retrocardiac opacity (increased per read, seems stable to my eye).
   Meds notable for vanc, cefepime, levoflox, bactrim, cellcept, midaz /
   fent, acyclovir, metoprolol, solumedrol.
   38 y/o s/p BMT with GVHD with resp failure.
   Resp failure is multifactorial
 GVHD lungs with baseline FVC and FEV1
   just under 1L as of 1 month ago before acute illness, now with ?pna
   ?worsened GVHD, also low NIFs c/w neuromuscular weakness, abdominal
   distention from cirrhosis / ascites.
   Currently still requiring a high degree of vent support, failing on
   14/5, try again with PSV today.  Not a candidate for NIPPV.
   Unclear how much of current illness is reversible.   Will likely need
   to get to tolerate more hypoventilation (allow HCO3 and PCO2 to rise).
   Would consider initiating discussion re: tracheostomy.  In meantime
   continue with antibiotics and steroids in hopes of some improvement,
   diuresis and bowel regimen for ascites and abdominal distention.
   Etiology of low [**Name (NI) **] unclear, ?contribution of immunsuppressants,
   critical illness.  Continue to follow mechanics.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now presenting with multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), severe baseline lung disease, and carbon dioxide retention. The patient's current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal distention due to cirrhosis and ascites, and elevated platelet count.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated pCO2 levels indicate respiratory failure, which is likely due to a combination of factors such as progression of GVHD, neuromuscular weakness, and abdominal distention.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of GVHD increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including pneumonia. The presence of a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray suggests a possible infection.

3. Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH): Given the patient's liver cirrhosis and ascites, there is a risk of developing PoPH, which can contribute to worsening respiratory status.

4. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS): Another complication associated with liver disease is HPS, characterized by abnormal oxygenation due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatations.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He has a history of mechanical heart valve and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient had an increase in redness in the lower extremities, leading to the removal of TEDs to prevent extravasation. He was successfully extubated without any complications and is now on pressure support. The patient's urine osmolality suggests a prerenal etiology. An order has been placed for an echo. The patient has multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levofloxacin, Acyclovir), sedatives (Midazolam), analgesics (Fentanyl), diuretic (Furosemide), antacid (Famotidine), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

1. Pneumonia: The patient is already diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's increased redness in the lower extremities could indicate the development of DVT. Proper prophylaxis measures should be in place to prevent this complication.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The imaging shows signs of pulmonary vascular congestion and borderline pulmonary edema, indicating potential fluid overload. Monitoring the patient's fluid balance and adjusting the treatment accordingly is crucial to prevent worsening of this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial secondary to
   progression of GVHD.  Although Low NIF (-20) could be from GVHD likely
   compounded by tense abdomen secondary to constipation and
   deconditioning.  Also being treated empirically for HAP.  Steroids have
   been increased per BMT 3 d ago.
   - continue methylprednisolone 50mg IV BID
   -Ensure continued bowel regimen to decrease tense abdomen
   -Also has significant ascites on US; can consider therapeutic
   paracentesis to remove fluid
   -Is and Os goal of -500 daily; if not reaching, rebolus with lasix
   -With bowel movements, can repeat NIF, attempt to wean to pressure
   support as tolerated
   - Continue HAP tx w/ cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin pending final
   cultures negative; completes course on [**2-23**].
   - F/u on sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis with superimposed respiratory alkalosis: on most
   recent ABG.
   -Could be due to overdiuresis, bowel regimen or more likely, renal
   losses.
   - For vent settings, pt would likely benefit from decreased TV.
   .
   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as
   manifestation of GVHD c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices, GI bleeds,
   now appears to have ascites.
   -Would consider therapeutic tap to improve respiratory status as likely
   is contributing to restrictive defect
   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN (could not
   estimate PA pressures on last echo) or hepatopulmonary disease; if
   still no improvement in respiratory function could re-assess with echo
   to evaluate for PA pressures + bubble study to check for HPS.
   .
   # Elevated PTT
   PT normal.
   - continue  HSQ at 2500 TID
   .
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT: Most recent PET scan with no
   evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
   -Monitor counts and toxicities
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   # GVHD.
   - Respiratory/steroids as above.
   - PPx with bactrim DS and Acyclovir
   - BMT recs,

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He has been experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and has developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to the progression of GVHD and severe baseline lung disease with carbon dioxide retention. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis with superimposed respiratory alkalosis, liver cirrhosis/ascites, elevated PTT, hypothyroidism, and gastric varices. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive GVHD: The patient's symptoms, such as multi-organ involvement and respiratory failure, may worsen due to the ongoing progression of GVHD.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory arrest or the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis with Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may have significant consequences on cardiac function and neuromuscular excitability, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other metabolic disturbances.
4. Liver Cirrhosis/Ascites: Complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and gastrointestinal bleeding may arise due to the progression of liver disease secondary to GVHD.
5. Elevated PTT: The prolonged partial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a rate of 14 breaths per minute with an FiO2 of 0.40. There has been some improvement in CO2 retention compared to the previous day. However, as bedtime approached, the patient's tidal volumes started decreasing, leading to a switch back to assist-control (AC) ventilation. The patient continues to experience thrombocytopenia, and famotidine has been discontinued as a result. There have been ongoing discussions regarding the possibility of extubation with the attending physician.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is acute respiratory failure, which is characterized by impaired gas exchange and inadequate ventilation. This can lead to hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels in the blood). The patient's reliance on mechanical ventilation indicates the severity of this condition.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's persistent thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is concerning. Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which may be related to decreased mobility and inadequate bowel care while in the ICU. Constipation can lead to discomfort"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Yesterday again placed on PSV 14/10 FIO2 .40 w/ less CO2 retention
   after several hours and did better than yesterday overall
   -As got closer to bedtime, tidal volumes started getting smaller and
   smaller, therefore was switched back to AC until AM when we plan to
   switch him back to PSV.
   -DC'd famotidine given persistent thrombocytopenia
   -BMT was again pushing for extubation

   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 5 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial secondary to
   progression of GVHD.  Although Low NIF (-20) could be from GVHD likely
   compounded by tense abdomen secondary to constipation and
   deconditioning.  Also being treated empirically for VAP.  Steroids have
   been increased per BMT 3 d ago.
   - continue methylprednisolone 50mg IV BID, although ?benefit given
   small likelihood that steroids are affecting pt
s course.
   -Ensure continued bowel regimen to decrease tense abdomen.
   -Also has significant ascites on US; can consider therapeutic
   paracentesis to remove fluid.
   -Is and Os goal of -500 daily; if not reaching, rebolus with lasix
   -With bowel movements, can repeat NIF, attempt to wean to pressure
   support as tolerated
   - Continue VAP tx w/ cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin; completes course on

   - To date, sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia negative except for
   1000 mL of yeast on sputum culture. Follow-up final culture data.

   # Acute respiratory alkalosis on chronic respiratory acidosis: on most
   recent ABG.
   - For vent settings, pt could benefit from decreased TV.
   - Will need to discuss goals of care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and patient, since
   high likelihood that patient will require tracheostomy in near future.
   - Will repeat ABG this PM.
   .
   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as
   manifestation of GVHD c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices, now appears
   to have ascites.
   -Considered therapeutic tap to improve respiratory status as likely is
   contributing to restrictive defect, but US with only moderate ascities
   present.
   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**]. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial secondary to progression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. He has been treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being weaned off pressure support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing CO2 retention and progression of GVHD.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): There is a risk of developing VAP, which has been treated empirically with antibiotics.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a tense abdomen likely due to constipation and deconditioning. He also has ascites, which could contribute to respiratory compromise.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient likely has liver cirrhosis secondary to GVHD, leading to portal hypertension and ascites.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires continuous"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-inch tall individual who weighs 58 kg and is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's main complaint is low oxygen saturation at the clinic. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and acyclovir. They were also given cefipime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and acyclovir on different dates. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 77-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/90 mmHg to 157/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with a range of 12-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a weight gain of 9.6 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,039 mL and output of 1,710 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,329 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and is on mechanical ventilation mode.

Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. However, the patient has elevated levels of creatinine, TCO2"

   Assessment and Plan:
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 6 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial secondary to
   progression of GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans.  Although Low NIF (-20)
   could be from GVHD likely compounded by tense abdomen secondary to
   constipation and deconditioning.  Also being treated empirically for
   VAP.  Steroids have been increased per BMT 4 d ago.
   - continue methylprednisolone 50mg IV BID, consider decreasing dose as
   unclear benefit
   -Ensure continued bowel regimen to decrease tense abdomen.
   -Also has significant ascites on US; can consider therapeutic
   paracentesis to remove fluid.
   -Is and Os goal of -500 daily; if not reaching, rebolus with lasix
   -With bowel movements, can repeat NIF, attempt to wean to pressure
   support as tolerated
   - stop VAP tx today, day [**8-1**]
   - To date, sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia negative except for
   1000 mL of yeast on sputum culture. Follow-up final culture data.
   - Plan for tracheostomy this week, consult thoracic surgery
   .
   # Acute respiratory alkalosis on chronic respiratory acidosis: on most
   recent ABG.
   - For vent settings, pt could benefit from decreased TV.
   - Will need to discuss goals of care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and patient, since
   high likelihood that patient will require tracheostomy in near future.
   .
   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as
   manifestation of GVHD c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices, now appears
   to have ascites.
   -Considered therapeutic tap to improve respiratory status as likely is
   contributing to restrictive defect, but US with only moderate ascities
   present.
   - continue to diurese
   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN.
   .
   # Elevated PTT; PT normal.
   - continue  HSQ at 2500 TID
   .
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT: Most recent PET scan with no
   evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
   -Monitor counts and toxicities
   - f/u BMT recs

   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial secondary to
   progression of GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans.  Also being treated
   empirically for VAP.  Steroids have been increased per BMT 4 d ago.
   - decrease methylprednisolone to 30mg IV, s/w BMT
   - diurese, lasix 20mg IV now, goal -500 daily
   - repeat sputum culture
   - continue abx one more day, today is day [**8-1**].
   - follow sputum cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], MAC, nocardia negative except for 1000
   mL of yeast on sputum culture. Follow-up final culture data.
   - Plan for tracheostomy later this week (Thursday or Friday), with PEG
   placement, consult thoracic surgery
   .
   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as
   manifestation of GVHD c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices, now appears
   to have ascites.  Could complicate approach for PEG placement.
   -Considered therapeutic tap to improve respiratory status as likely is
   contributing to restrictive defect, but US with only moderate ascities
   present.
   - continue to diurese

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). 

The patient's current medications include methylprednisolone, lasix, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The plan is to decrease the dose of methylprednisolone, continue diuresis with lasix, repeat sputum culture, and continue antibiotic therapy for one more day. Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement are planned later this week, with consultation from thoracic surgery.

The patient also has evidence of liver cirrhosis and ascites, which may complicate the PEG placement. Therapeutic paracentesis has been considered to improve respiratory status, but only moderate ascites is present. Diuretic therapy will continue.

The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) while the prothrombin time (PT) remains normal. He is being continued on heparin subcutaneously.

Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in remission, and gastric varices. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a cachectic appearing male with low oxygen saturation who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There have been discussions regarding the need for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain management, and sedation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 101/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological examination shows that he responds to commands and is interactive, but movement, tone, and reflexes have not been assessed. The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies have been performed but are not mentioned in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Tracheostomy Complications: If the tracheostomy procedure is performed, there is a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures.
3. PEG Tube Placement Complications: Similarly, if the PEG tube is placed, there"

   failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial secondary to
   progression of GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans.  Although Low NIF (-20)
   could be from GVHD likely compounded by tense abdomen secondary to
   constipation and deconditioning.  Also being treated empirically for
   VAP.  Steroids have been increased per BMT 4 d ago.
   - continue methylprednisolone 50mg IV BID
   -Ensure continued bowel regimen to decrease tense abdomen.
   -Also has significant ascites on US; can consider therapeutic
   paracentesis to remove fluid.
   -Is and Os goal of -500 daily; if not reaching, rebolus with lasix
   -With bowel movements, can repeat NIF, attempt to wean to pressure
   support as tolerated
   - Continue VAP tx w/ cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin; completes course on

   # Acute respiratory alkalosis on chronic respiratory acidosis: on most
   recent ABG.
   - For vent settings, pt could benefit from decreased TV.
   - Will need to discuss goals of care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] and patient, since
   high likelihood that patient will require tracheostomy in near future.

   #Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to liver disease as

   to have ascites.
   -Considered therapeutic tap to improve respiratory status as likely is
   contributing to restrictive defect, but US with only moderate ascities
   present.
   - continue to diurese
   -Given portal HTN and related complications, unclear if worsening
   respiratory status could be secondary to portopulmonary HTN.
   # Elevated PTT; PT normal.
   - continue  HSQ at 2500 TID

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**]. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and worsening ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's recent CXR shows new right infrahilar consolidation, worsening left lower lobe consolidation, leftward mediastinal shift, and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - The patient is experiencing difficulty exhaling carbon dioxide, leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be caused by various factors, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and worsening VAP.
2. Bronchiolitis obliterans - This is a lung condition that can occur after lung injury or infection, leading to scarring and narrowing of the small airways. It can cause difficulty breathing and respiratory failure.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient's worsening lung condition may be due to pneumonia acquired while on mechanical ventilation. VAP is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
4. Liver cirrhosis/ascites - The patient may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. His current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial due to GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and worsening ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture from [**2-23**] is contaminated by oral flora. The plan includes switching Methylprednisolone to Prednisone 30mg, diuresis with Lasix, repeating sputum culture, discontinuing antibiotics, planning for tracheostomy and PEG placement with thoracic surgery consultation, and monitoring liver function tests and coagulation parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient has worsening VAP, and there is suspicion for pulmonary infection due to new right infrahilar consolidation seen on CXR. Repeat sputum culture is planned to identify the causative organism.
2. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient may have developed liver cirrhosis/ascites secondary to GVHD. This could complicate the approach for PEG placement, but thoracic surgery did"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and developed multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including liver cirrhosis/ascites, depression, anemia, elevated PTT, hypothyroidism, and gastric varices.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient may have developed liver cirrhosis and ascites secondary to GVHD and portal hypertension. This could complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening pneumonia on the chest X-ray indicates a potential bacterial infection. The sputum culture results will help guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Depression: The prolonged ICU course and need for further interventions may contribute to the patient's depression. It is important to discuss a social worker visit with the patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes a planned tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) by Thoracic surgery scheduled for Friday. 

The patient has shown increasing white blood cell count (WBC) with a recent chest X-ray revealing new right infrahilar consolidation, which could be either asymmetric edema or new pneumonia. There is also worsening consolidation in the left lower lobe and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion that is stable. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/81 mmHg to 148/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), total bilirubin (T Bili), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lactic acid. The blood glucose level is also high. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a complicated medical history including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's recent imaging shows new right infrahilar consolidation, worsening left lower lobe consolidation, leftward mediastinal shift, and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Microbiology results are pending. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on Friday due to his severe respiratory failure and need for long-term ventilation support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and worsening lung disease, there is a risk of developing VAP. The CXR findings suggest worsening pneumonia, and the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure and pneumonia, with plans for a tracheostomy on 2/26. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to obstructive bronchitis from GVHD, pneumonia, and diaphragmatic weakness with decreased negative inspiratory force (NIF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant hypercarbic respiratory failure and requires prolonged ventilator support. Cefepime and Levofloxacin will be discontinued since the patient is clinically stable. A trial in spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today, with continued full support at night. An arterial blood gas (ABG) will be checked at the completion of SBT for evaluation. Diuretics will be continued.
2. GVHD: The patient has substantial GVHD, and the BMT team will guide medication dosing. Mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone will be administered at a dose of 30mg q 12 hours.
3. Lymphoma: The patient has completed BMT and will be supported with medication intervention and respiratory support as mentioned above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and has been in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has completed an 8-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is doing progressively better but still requires assisted ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. This condition can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia vs. Atelectasis: The dense opacification of the left lower lobe seen on the chest X-ray may represent pneumonia or atelectasis. If it is pneumonia, the patient may require additional antibiotics or interventions to treat the infection.
3. Liver Cirrhosis/Ascites: The patient likely has liver cirrhosis/ascites secondary to GVHD and portal hypertension. This could complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Monitoring liver function tests and coag"

   failure.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial [**1-26**] to GVHD,
   bronchiolitis obliterans. CT surgery planning for tracheostomy & PEG
   placement on Friday. WBC 8.3 this AM, CXR mildly improved. Suspicion

   portal HTN), per thoracic surgery
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Could complicate approach for PEG
   placement, but thoracic surgery did not feel therapeutic paracentesis
   was necessary given moderate ascites

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently in remission. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 7 in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. His current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, liver cirrhosis/ascites, depression, anemia, elevated PTT, hypothyroidism, and gastric varices.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has a history of severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, which puts him at risk for further respiratory complications. These may include pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Liver Cirrhosis/Ascites: The patient's liver cirrhosis may lead to complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. These conditions can complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

3. Depression: The patient's prolonged ICU course and need for further interventions increase the risk of developing depression. This may affect his recovery and overall well-being.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable but mildly iron deficient."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. The patient's condition has been managed with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement planned for Friday, antibiotics stopped, pressure support ventilation (PSV) initially, then changed to continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) overnight due to periods of apnea. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) at 8 PM showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 155 mmHg, and HCO3- 39 mEq/L. A repeat chest X-ray (CXR) is ordered for the morning to assess interval changes. Diuretics are continued with a goal of -500cc daily. The patient's line is noted to be kinked but still able to draw off, so it is not changed. The plan is to avoid PEG tube due to portal hypertension. The patient's allergies, medications, and medical history are documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The dense opacification of the left lower lobe seen on the CXR may represent pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and symptoms of infection.
2. Atelectasis: The dense opacification of the left lower lobe could also indicate at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's recent events include being on pressure support ventilation (PSV) from 11:00 to 22:00 yesterday with a PSof of 18/12, then put back on assist control (AC) with a tidal volume (TV) in 200s. The patient's 9PM arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 65, PaO2 of 93, HCO3- of 42, BE of -11, and O2 saturation of 97%. The patient's goal is to be negative 0.5L, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 410 cc over the past 24 hours. The patient's sputum culture showed op flora. The patient's prednisone dosage was tapered to 20 mg PO BID, and they will discuss the goal of immunosuppression with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)]. The patient also discussed their plan for nutrition with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)]. The patient is mildly iron deficient but will not receive supplementation at this time. The patient's vitamin D levels are pending. The arterial line was stopped at 01:00 PM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post alloBMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) complicated by multi-organ GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on 02/04/2162, day 8 in Hospital Unit 44 for hypercarbic respiratory failure, intubated but tolerating PSV (pressure support ventilation) for several hours a day.

The patient has completed an 8-day course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) tomorrow, with possible extubation. If the patient cannot tolerate this, he will be reintubated and a tracheostomy will be planned for Monday.

The patient also has liver cirrhosis/ascites, likely secondary to GVHD causing portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. Esophageal varices may complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, but thoracic surgery did not feel therapeutic paracentesis was necessary given moderate ascites. No paracentesis will be performed at this time.

Other conditions mentioned in the progress note include depression, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post alloBMT in remission"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and has been in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated but tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) for several hours a day. His recent sputum culture showed multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - The patient is likely experiencing this due to GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and severe baseline lung disease with CO2 retention. He has completed an 8-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is doing progressively better with PSV during the day. The plan is to perform spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) tomorrow and consider extubation. If the patient cannot tolerate SBT, he will be reintubated and tracheostomy will be planned for Monday.
2. Liver cirrhosis/ascites - This is likely secondary to GVHD causing portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. The patient's approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement may be complicated by this condition. However, thoracic surgery did not feel therapeutic paracentesis was"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient, a 38-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). The patient also has multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO).
- The patient was extubated yesterday and has been using CPAP intermittently. His ABG results show a pH of 7.31, which indicates respiratory acidosis.
- The patient has been on a course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has completed an 8-day treatment.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, and he has mildly elevated PTT levels. He is being monitored for any signs of liver cirrhosis or ascites, which could be secondary to GVHD.
- The patient has anemia, which is likely due to chronic inflammation or occult GI losses from hemorrhoids/varices. His Hct has improved from 30.0 to 33.7 today.
- The patient's thyroid function tests are normal, indicating no hypothyroidism.
- The patient has gastric varices but is currently normotensive. He is being monitored for any changes in his blood pressure.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.1,"

The patient is a 67-inch tall, 58 kg adult male who was admitted with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently extubated but experienced fatigue with breathing around 3 PM, prompting the initiation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and Bactrim) as well as acyclovir. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 109/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis and lansoprazole (Prevacid). Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for fatigue with breathing. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 212 mL, including 52 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2050 mL, with 450 mL of urine output. The patient's weight is currently 58 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 48.4 kg. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 7.6 to 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin levels from 10.6 to 13.1 g/dL, platelet count from 136 to 164 K/uL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is using CPAP intermittently. He is currently receiving prednisone, Lasix, and other medications as per BMT recommendations. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver cirrhosis/ascites secondary to GVHD. There are also signs of depression, anemia, elevated PTT, hypothyroidism, gastric varices, anxiety, hypotension, leukocytosis, and potential medical complications related to his previous conditions. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is responding well off the ventilator. Further management includes close monitoring, BiPAP therapy, encouraging oral intake, and continued treatment for GVHD."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been extubated. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and severe baseline lung disease. He is also likely to have liver cirrhosis/ascites secondary to GVHD, esophageal varices, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Close monitoring of his condition and repeat ABG analysis is necessary.
2. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient's ascites could complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile is needed.
3. Esophageal varices: The patient's risk of bleeding from esophageal varices is increased. Gastric varices are also present. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and consideration for therapeutic paracentesis may be required.
4. Depression: The patient's prolonged ICU course and need for further interventions may increase the risk of depression. A social worker visit should be scheduled to discuss the patient's mental health.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and was extubated on February 26th. The patient is still using BiPAP intermittently and has been tolerating oral intake with Ensure supplements. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of dyspnea and cough on February 4th led to his admission for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Although he was extubated on February 26th, there is a need for continued monitoring and management of his respiratory status.
2. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO): As a complication of GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans can cause severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest persistent or worsening BO.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite completing a 20-day course of antibiotics, the persistence of left"

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a background of multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease.

The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on 2/4/2162 and is now day 9 in the hospital unit. He was intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure but was successfully extubated on 2/26/2162. The respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, contributed by GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient completed an 8-day course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) intermittently when feeling fatigued.

The patient's liver function tests show evidence of cirrhosis/ascites, which is likely secondary to GVHD and may complicate the approach for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. There are no plans for therapeutic paracentesis at this time due to moderate ascites. The patient's coagulation profile shows mildly elevated PTT, but PT/INR is normal. The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis.

The patient also has anemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been extubated. The patient has multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease, leading to his current condition. He also has leukocytosis, esophageal varices, ascites, and depression.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is using BiPAP intermittently and needs close monitoring.
2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has multi-organ GVHD, which can affect various systems, including the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. He is receiving immunosuppressive therapy to manage this condition.
3. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO): The patient has severe baseline lung disease and BO, which can lead to progressive scarring and obstruction of the small airways. This can further worsen his respiratory function.
4. Esophageal varices: The patient has esophageal varices likely secondary to liver cirrhosis/ascites due to GVHD. There is a risk of bleeding from these varices, and the patient"

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is extubated on 02/26. The patient has a complex medical history, including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and interactive, with no jugular venous distention or neck stiffness. His lungs are clear to auscultation, with decreased breath sounds at the left base. The patient has no edema or abnormal pulses, and his neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 184 K/uL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 39 mg/dL, creatinine is 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose is within normal limits. Imaging reveals unchanged opacification of the left lower lobe on chest X-ray, and sputum culture is negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued treatment for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial and related to GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is also being treated for leukocytosis, which may be a response to extubation or due to a pulmonary infection. Repeat VBG and lateral chest film are planned to assess pH, CO2, and evaluate the left lower lobe opacity. The patient's nutrition plan includes tolerating PO with Ensure supplements but no plan for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to esophageal varices. The patient's liver cirrhosis and ascites are likely secondary to GVHD and portal hypertension, with no immediate need for paracentesis. The patient's depression will be followed by BMT social work, and his anemia is improving but may be related to chronic inflammation and occult GI losses. The patient's elevated PTT will be managed with subcutaneous heparin, and his hypothyroidism is stable on levothyroxine. The patient's gastric varices are currently normotensive, and he is on metoprolol for prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is using CPAP intermittently. He has completed a 20-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but there is persistent opacity on the chest X-ray. The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17,000/mm^3, mostly neutrophils. He also has an elevated temperature and heart rate, which are concerning for a new infection or venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - likely multifactorial due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is extubated and using CPAP intermittently. He completed a 20-day course of antibiotics for VAP, but there is persistent opacity on the chest X-ray, which raises concern for a new or persistent infection.
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO BID as per BMT recommendations.
   - Perform a PA/lat chest X-ray.
2. Leukocytosis - WBC increased to 17,000/mm^3 with 90% neutrophils. This is concerning for a new infection, especially given the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been extubated. The patient has severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. He presents with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was admitted to the ICU. His recent imaging shows persistent loss of the left hemidiaphragm, likely representing pleural fluid and consolidation. The patient is still experiencing leukocytosis and has an increased white blood cell count. There are concerns about new or persistent infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline lung disease and CO2 retention put him at risk for respiratory failure. The use of CPAP intermittently may help manage this condition.
2. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO): This is a complication of stem cell transplantation and can cause airflow obstruction.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient has been extubated, there is a concern for persistent infection, and further work-up is needed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count indicates an ongoing inflammatory response, which could be due to infection or other causes.
5. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient likely has liver disease secondary to GVHD, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure. The patient's condition has improved slightly, with less shortness of breath observed in the morning. The patient is currently on various medications, including acyclovir and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

24-hour events reveal that the patient received antibiotics (acyclovir) on February 27th at 3:47 PM. Heparin sodium was administered on February 28th at 11:50 PM for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for hyperglycemia mentioned under endocrine. No significant changes are noted in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integumentary (skin), or neurologic systems.

Physical examination findings indicate that the patient appears well-nourished, is not in acute distress, and shows no signs of edema or cyanosis. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, with SpO2 levels at 100%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/86 to 107/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) and is now presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for this condition and has been extubated but requires intermittent CPAP support. The patient's leukocyte count has been increasing, reaching 22 today, with 91% neutrophils and 3 bands, which raises concerns for a new infection given his immunosuppressed status. The patient is currently receiving fluconazole for suspected fungal infection.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no significant changes in left basal consolidation and small to moderate left pleural effusion. The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction, and there is a small amount of right pleural effusion that cannot be excluded.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 131/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but there are elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total"

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a complicated medical history including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease.

The patient's recent presentation includes dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**], which led to his admission to the hospital unit for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [**2-26**] and has been using CPAP intermittently when feeling fatigued.

His current vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/90 to 135/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a cachectic appearing male who is alert and interactive. His lungs have distant breath sounds with no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. There is no jugular venous distention (JVD), and his extremities show no edema with distal pulses (DPs) and posterior tibial pulses (PTs) present.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a complicated medical history, including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease. He presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and has been in the hospital since then.

The patient's leukocyte count has been increasing, reaching 22 today, with 91% neutrophils and 3 bands. This could be concerning for a new infection, especially considering the patient's immunosuppressed status. The patient has started on fluconazole.

The patient's temperature rose to 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday evening. Repeat urinalysis, urine culture, and sputum culture have been ordered. A blood culture will be done if there is a spike. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses may be considered if other sources are negative.

The patient is still experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He was extubated on January 29th and is using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) intermittently when feeling fatigued. He completed a 20-day course for ventilator"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He presented with dyspnea and cough on day 9 in the hospital and was diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU, extubated, and using CPAP intermittently when feeling fatigued. The patient has been on a prolonged ICU course and has multiple medical complications including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, liver cirrhosis/ascites, anemia, elevated PTT, depression, hypothyroidism, gastric varices, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, which raises concern for a new infection. The presence of fever and worsening leukocytosis suggests a possible bacterial infection. Further investigations, such as repeat urine analysis, urine culture, blood cultures, and sputum culture, are needed to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Sinus infection: The patient's BMT team is concerned about a possible sinus infection due to his cough. Although the patient is currently afebrile, the rising temperature warrants further investigation, including imaging studies like a CT scan of the sinuses.

3. GVHD: The patient has a history of multi-organ GVHD."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure. They are not on a ventilator and have shown no change in cough. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is climbing, but there is no clear source of infection. The patient's platelet count (plt ct) is also rising. The patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, airway clearance, balance, gait, respiration/gas exchange, and ventilation. Additionally, the patient exhibits anxiety, alteration in elimination related to constipation, hypotension, respiratory failure (not ARDS), anemia, depression, and alteration in nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The increasing WBC count suggests a possible infection. It is crucial to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The rising plt ct could indicate thrombocytopenia or low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and should be monitored closely.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure indicates compromised lung function. Continued monitoring and supportive care will be necessary to manage this condition.

4. Impaired nutrition: The patient's poor oral intake and reliance on tube feeds suggest an alteration in nutrition. Nutritional support should be optimized to prevent malnutrition and associated complications.

5. Anxiety and depression: The presence of anxiety and depression may impact the patient's overall well-being and recovery"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and has been in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure since then.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 37.2 C (98.9 F), HR: 74 bpm, BP: 96/64 mmHg, RR: 21 breaths/min, SpO2: 96%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a PICC line inserted on [**2162-2-17**] at 12:02 PM.
- Fluid balance: Total input of 1,400 mL and total output of 875 mL since [**63**] AM, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 525 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on CPAP intermittently when feeling fatigued.
- Oxygenation: SpO2 stable at 99-100%.
- ABG results: pH: 7.26, PCO2: 116 mmHg, PO2: 57 mmHg, HCO3: 44 mEq/L.
- Imaging: CT sinuses show mucosal thickening with aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells, and minimal in the maxillary sinus, suggesting an acute component. CT chest reveals peribronchovascular ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe (RLL) > right middle lobe (RML), which could represent infection or aspiration. There is also mucus plugging noted in the RLL, consolidation, and atelectasis of the basilar segments of the left lower lobe (LLL), as well as a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with consolidation and atelectasis.
- Microbiology: Blood cultures x 2 are pending, and urine culture is also pending.

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been experiencing worsening leukocytosis. The patient has chronic pulmonary disease, which makes significant long-term improvement in respiratory status unlikely. The current plan of care includes continuing prednisone, antibiotics, and encouraging the use of CPAP when the patient feels fatigued. The patient's recent imaging studies show mucosal thickening with aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells, and minimal involvement of the maxillary sinus. There are also peribronchovascular ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe (RLL) with possible infection or aspiration. Additionally, there is a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with consolidation and atelectasis of the basilar segments of the left lower lobe (LLL). 

The patient has multiple medical conditions including liver cirrhosis/ascites, anemia, depression, hypothyroidism, gastric varices, and anxiety. He is currently on several medications including prednisone, Cellcept, Bactrim, acyclovir, and levothyroxine. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slight improvement in hemoglobin level, and normal potassium, sodium, and chloride levels. The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been extubated. The patient has multiple medical complications including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), severe baseline lung disease, and CO2 retention. He presents with dyspnea and cough and is now showing signs of worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's CT sinus and chest indicate possible infection, but he remains afebrile without clinical change. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been recommended by the BMT team, and he is currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with pending cultures. The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and possibly sinopulmonary infection. He is being encouraged to use CPAP intermittently when feeling fatigued.

The patient also has liver cirrhosis/ascites, most likely secondary to GVHD and portal hypertension. He has stable coags and LFTs. He remains in remission from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient has anemia, depression, hypothyroidism, gastric varices, and anxiety. He is being followed by BMT social work"

The patient has been diagnosed with mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells, and minimal involvement in the maxillary sinus, which may indicate an acute component. Additionally, there is evidence of increased left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, and the patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole for broad coverage.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate in the 170s (tachycardia), and blood pressure ranging from 96/64 mmHg to 72/101 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is stable at 99-100%. The patient's weight is currently 58 kg, with a height of 67 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,400 mL and output of 875 mL, resulting in a net fluid balance of 525 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with BiPAP and has an ABG showing pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and PaO2 of 116 mmHg.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 9.4 to 22.2 K/u"

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated yesterday after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ? LLL infection causing
   chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress and since extubation on [**2-26**],
   patient has required frequent CPAP to prevent respiratory fatigue.
   Yesterday PM, patient became hypoxic after eating, tachycardic to the
   230
s, hypotensive to the 70
s, with pO2 <40 on BiPAP, ultimately
   requiring re-intubation.  Patient
s acute hypoxic respiratory failure
   from aspiration may have driven a catecholemine surge causing
   tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV
   filling leading to hypotension. His already poor respiratory status
   left him unable to compensate for his new aspiration event. This is
   supported by the fact that after the patient was intubated, his heart
   rate returned to the 80
s with IV Dilatiazem 10mg x 1 and his blood
   pressures subsequently improved. He did ultimately require
   phenylephrine as his sbp
s dropped with sedation, but repeat ABG after
   intubation was greatly improved and he maintained a normal heart rate
   and blood pressure without rate control agents overnight.
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 3
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - IV Diltiazem:PRN tachycardia
   - Wean pressors as sedation is weaned
   - Wean respiratory rate to target baseline pCO2 of 60-80
   - Treat active pulmonary processes
   # ? Aspiration pneumonia: Seen in RLL on CTA from [**3-4**] in the context
   of patient eating dinner just prior to respiratory failure. Currently
   on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with infectious studies pending
   including glucan/galactomannan, blood cultures pending.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 3
   - D/C Vancomycin if blood cultures x 48 hours negative
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray

   negatives with Cipro/Flagyl
   # LLL Pneumonia: WBC down slightly to 11.8 today. Seen on CT from [**3-2**]
   demonstrating worsening, severe, left lower lobe pneumonia, complicated
   by obstructing adenopathy or phlegmon at the segmental level. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/Vori as above
   - Treatment otherwise as above
   - Plan for repeat Bronchoscopy today

   baseline anemia of chronic inflammation, but acute drop in Hct likely
   partly dilutional after fluid repletion as all cell counts down, but
   also in context of A-line placement, frequent blood work during
   respiratory event yesterday night. Suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage
   or occult bleed low, but given patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been intubated. The patient has a history of multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on 02/04 and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by several events, including hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, left lower lobe pneumonia, anemia, liver cirrhosis/ascites, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced an episode of hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration. This can be a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, as evidenced by new consolidation in the right lower lobe seen on the CT scan. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and sepsis.
3. Left lower lobe pneumonia: The patient has severe left lower lobe pneumonia, which may require further treatment and may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped significantly, indicating acute blood loss or ongoing bleeding. This can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and may require urgent blood transfusion.
5. Liver cirrhosis"

   Yesterday PM, patient became hypoxic after eating, tachycardic to the
   230
s, hypotensive to the 70
s, with pO2 <40 on BiPAP, ultimately
   requiring re-intubation.  Patient
s acute hypoxic respiratory failure
   from aspiration may have driven a catecholemine surge causing
   tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV
   filling leading to hypotension. This is supported by the fact that
   after the patient was intubated, his heart rate improved with IV
   Dilatiazem and his pressures subsequently came up. He did require

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes multi-organ graft versus host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and severe baseline lung disease. 

The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [2162-2-4] and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [2-26] but required re-intubation yesterday after an aspiration event. The patient's recent events include tachycardia to 230 bpm, hypotension to 70 mmHg, and hypoxia requiring re-intubation. The patient's ABG after intubation showed significant improvement.

The patient has multiple complications and conditions that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress and requires frequent CPAP to prevent respiratory fatigue. The recent aspiration event led to acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was managed by intubation. The patient may have experienced a catecholamine surge causing tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV filling leading to hypotension. This is supported by the fact that after intubation, his heart rate improved with IV Dil"

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure from aspiration: The patient experienced acute hypoxic respiratory failure after eating, leading to re-intubation. This may have been caused by aspiration pneumonia.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has new consolidation in the right lower lobe on chest CT, suggesting aspiration pneumonia. He is currently receiving antibiotics for this.
3. Left lower lobe pneumonia: The patient has severe left lower lobe pneumonia, which is worsening despite treatment. Bronchoscopy may be considered for further evaluation.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 34.7 to 27.3, likely due to fluid repletion and possible occult bleed. Pulmonary hemorrhage or esophageal varices could be contributing factors.
5. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient likely has portal hypertension secondary to GVHD, leading to esophageal varices and ascites. Coagulation and liver function tests are stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated yesterday after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ? LLL infection causing
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Since extubation on [**2-26**], patient has
   required frequent CPAP to prevent respiratory fatigue. Yesterday PM,
   patient hypoxic after eating, tachycardic to 230
s, hypotensive to the
   70
s, with pO2 <40 on BiPAP.  Patient endorsed respiratory exhaustion
   and was re-intubated. CTA demonstrated a new aspiration in the RLL.
   Repeat ABG after intubation was greatly improved.
   - Continuing Prednisone 20mg PO BID
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 3
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   # ? Aspiration pneumonia: Seen in RLL on CTA from [**3-4**] in the context
   of patient eating dinner just prior to respiratory failure. Currently
   on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with infectious studies pending
   including glucan/galactomannan, blood cultures pending.

   # Anemia: Hct down to 27.3 today from 34.7 yesterday AM. Patient with
   baseline anemia of chronic inflammation, but acute drop in Hct likely
   partly dilutional after fluid repletion as all cell counts down, but
   also in context of A-line placement, frequent blood work during
   respiratory event yesterday night. Suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage
   or occult bleed low, but given patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post allo BMT, complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated twice and re-intubated due to aspiration events. He has a new consolidation in the right lower lobe suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. His ABG after intubation showed improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and possible left lower lobe infection causing hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event during dinner, along with the new consolidation seen in the right lower lobe on CTA, suggests aspiration pneumonia. He is currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with pending infectious studies.
3. Left lower lobe pneumonia: The worsening severe left lower lobe pneumonia seen on CT from [**3-2**] is being treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Vori. A bronchoscopy may be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 34.7 to 27.3, which could be partly dilutional after fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [2162-2-4] and is now on day 9 in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated on [2-26] but required re-intubation yesterday due to an aspiration event. He has a new consolidation in the right lower lobe suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. The patient's ABG after intubation showed significant improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. He is currently on antibiotics, but pending infectious studies including glucan/galactomannan, blood cultures are pending. Antibiotics should be continued, and if blood cultures are negative after 48 hours, vancomycin can be discontinued.
2. Left Lower Lobe Pneumonia: The patient has severe left lower lobe pneumonia that is worsening. He is already on vancomycin/cefepime/voriconazole. Treatment should be continued as above, and a bronchoscopy may be considered.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 34.7 to 27.3 today. This could be due to dilutional effects after fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was admitted to the hospital unit for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. He was extubated on February 26th but re-intubated yesterday after an aspiration event. The patient's condition is complicated by multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and possible lower left lobe infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and possible LLL infection, which is causing hypercarbic respiratory failure. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood and potential organ damage.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had an aspiration event, resulting in a new consolidation in the right lower lobe. This can lead to a secondary infection and further respiratory compromise.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has multi-organ GVHD, which can affect various organs including the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to liver dysfunction, skin rash, and diarrhea.
4. Bronchiolitis obliterans: The patient has severe bronchiolitis obliter"

   improved to 93 on CPAP.  Based on patient
s chronic pulmonary disease,
   patient
s respiratory status is unlikely to improve significantly
   long-term and a coordinated plan of care with BMT may be useful in
   planning for treatment long-term.
   - Continuing Prednisone 20mg PO BID

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. He was extubated on [**2-26**] but required intermittent CPAP due to respiratory distress. His condition worsened overnight, leading to tachycardia, tachypnea, and restlessness. The patient's VBG demonstrated significant hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, and possible sino-pulmonary infection contribute to his current respiratory failure. This condition can lead to decreased oxygenation and acid-base disturbances.
2. Sino-pulmonary infection: The patient has leukocytosis and imaging suggesting infection in the sinuses and lungs. This infection can worsen respiratory distress and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Liver cirrhosis/ascites: The patient likely has liver cirrhosis secondary to GVHD, which can lead to portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. These complications can result in gastrointestinal bleeding and increased risk of infection.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male who presented to the hospital with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's 24-hour events include a negative urine culture, initiation of voriconazole therapy, tachycardia with frequent changes in heart rate and blood pressure, placement on BiPAP without response, administration of IV fluids and lopressor, EKG demonstrating atrial tachycardia or AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, placement of arterial line, ABG showing respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia, intubation, administration of IV diltiazem, stabilization of blood pressure, CTA chest revealing new consolidation in the right base suggestive of aspiration, placement of Dobhoff catheter, and initiation of phenylephrine infusion for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents. The patient is currently on fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine infusions, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate ranging from 84-176 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73-100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 58 kg, with a total fluid input of 4,771 mL and a balance of -230 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 176. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels, as well as elevated lactate levels. The patient's imaging reveals new consolidation in the right lung base consistent with aspiration, and there is also a small right pleural effusion. The patient's urine culture is negative, and blood cultures are pending. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TF), glycemic control, lines (PICC line and arterial line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated yesterday after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ? LLL infection causing
   chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress and since extubation on [**2-26**],
   patient has required frequent CPAP to prevent respiratory fatigue.
   Yesterday PM, patient became hypoxic after eating, tachycardic to the
   230
s, hypotensive to the 70
s, with pO2 <40 on BiPAP, ultimately
   requiring re-intubation.  Patient
s acute hypoxic respiratory failure
   from aspiration may have driven a catecholemine surge causing
   tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV
   filling leading to hypotension. His already poor respiratory status
   left him unable to compensate for his new aspiration event. This is
   supported by the fact that after the patient was intubated, his heart
   rate returned to the 80
s with IV Dilatiazem 10mg x 1 and his blood
   pressures subsequently improved. He did ultimately require
   phenylephrine as his sbp
s dropped with sedation, but repeat ABG after
   intubation was greatly improved and he maintained a normal heart rate
   and blood pressure without rate control agents overnight.
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 3
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - IV Diltiazem:PRN tachycardia
   - Wean pressors as sedation is weaned
   - Wean respiratory rate to target baseline pCO2 of 60-80
   - Treat active pulmonary processes
   # ? Aspiration pneumonia: Seen in RLL on CTA from [**3-4**] in the context
   of patient eating dinner just prior to respiratory failure. Currently
   on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with infectious studies pending
   including glucan/galactomannan, blood cultures pending.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 3
   - D/C Vancomycin if blood cultures x 48 hours negative
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray
   - Sputum culture ordered
   - Consider expanding antibiotic coverage for anaerobes & double gram
   negatives with Cipro/Flagyl
   # LLL Pneumonia: WBC down slightly to 11.8 today. Seen on CT from [**3-2**]
   demonstrating worsening, severe, left lower lobe pneumonia, complicated
   by obstructing adenopathy or phlegmon at the segmental level. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/Vori as above
   - Treatment otherwise as above
   - Plan for repeat Bronchoscopy today
   # Nutrition: Completed calorie counts, now with Dobhoff in place.
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Restart TF
   # Anemia: Hct down to 27.3 today from 34.7 yesterday AM. Patient with
   baseline anemia of chronic inflammation, but acute drop in Hct likely
   partly dilutional after fluid repletion as all cell counts down, but
   also in context of A-line placement, frequent blood work during
   respiratory event yesterday night. Suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage
   or occult bleed low, but given patient
s known esophageal varices and
   recent Dobhoff placement, will trend Hct.
   - PM Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Active T&S
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Coags and LFT
s stable.
   - Trend LFT
s, coags
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg PO BID
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Depression: In the context of prolonged ICU course and need for
   further interventions.
   - Followed by BMT social work.
   # Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH & free T4 from [**12/2161**]
   - Continue Levothyroxine 125mcg PO daily
   # Gastric varices:  Normotensive.
   - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated yesterday after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and ? LLL infection causing
   chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress and since extubation on [**2-26**],
   patient has required frequent CPAP to prevent respiratory fatigue.
   Yesterday PM, patient became hypoxic after eating, tachycardic to the
   230
s, hypotensive to the 70
s, with pO2 <40 on BiPAP, ultimately
   requiring re-intubation.  Patient
s acute hypoxic respiratory failure
   from aspiration may have driven a catecholemine surge causing
   tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV
   filling leading to hypotension. His already poor respiratory status
   left him unable to compensate for his new aspiration event. This is
   supported by the fact that after the patient was intubated, his heart
   rate returned to the 80
s with IV Dilatiazem 10mg x 1 and his blood
   pressures subsequently improved. He did ultimately require
   phenylephrine as his sbp
s dropped with sedation, but repeat ABG after
   intubation was greatly improved and he maintained a normal heart rate
   and blood pressure without rate control agents overnight.
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO BID
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 3
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - IV Diltiazem:PRN tachycardia
   - Wean pressors as sedation is weaned
   # ? Aspiration pneumonia: Seen in RLL on CTA from [**3-4**] in the context
   of patient eating dinner just prior to respiratory failure. Currently
   on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole with infectious studies pending
   including glucan/galactomannan, blood cultures pending.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 3
   - D/C Vancomycin if blood cultures x 48 hours negative
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray
   - Sputum culture ordered
   - Consider expanding antibiotic coverage for anaerobes & double gram
   negatives with Cipro/Flagyl
   # LLL Pneumonia: WBC down slightly to 11.8 today. Seen on CT from [**3-2**]
   demonstrating worsening, severe, left lower lobe pneumonia, complicated
   by obstructing adenopathy or phlegmon at the segmental level. On
   Vanc/Cefepime/Vori as above
   - Treatment otherwise as above
   - Consider bronchoscopy
   # Nutrition: Completed calorie counts, now with Dobhoff in place.
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Restart TF
   # Anemia: Hct down to 27.3 today from 34.7 yesterday AM. Patient with
   baseline anemia of chronic inflammation, but acute drop in Hct likely
   partly dilutional after fluid repletion as all cell counts down, but
   also in context of A-line placement, frequent blood work during
   respiratory event yesterday night. Suspicion for pulmonary hemorrhage
   or occult bleed low, but given patient
s known esophageal varices and
   recent Dobhoff placement, will trend Hct.
   - PM Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Active T&S
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Coags and LFT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post allo BMT (bone marrow transplant) who is currently experiencing multi-organ GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and severe baseline lung disease. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [2/4] and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [2/26] but required re-intubation yesterday after an aspiration event.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and possible left lower lobe infection causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. After extubation, the patient required frequent CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) to prevent respiratory fatigue. He became hypoxic after eating, tachycardic, and hypotensive, ultimately requiring re-intubation. The hypoxic respiratory failure from aspiration may have driven a catecholamine surge causing tachycardia poorly responsive to beta-blockade and resulting in poor LV (left ventricular) filling leading to hypotension.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) who is now presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has had several events since admission.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension after being extubated and placed on CPAP for six days. This led to the need for re-intubation due to aspiration. The patient's worsening lung pathology, including pre-existing lung disease such as GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia (PNA), contributed to this event. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and will require a tracheostomy in the next week.

2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral lower lobe PNA, which is likely complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction caused by secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon. This condition was worsened by a likely aspiration event on [**3-4**]. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, voriconazole, and metronidazole. Infectious studies, including glucan/galactomannan and blood cultures, are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated yesterday after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA causing chronic
   hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-4**], after having been extubated
   and on CPAP for 6 days, patient became hypoxic, tachycardic and
   hypotensive requiring re-intubation.  This was likely secondary to
   aspiration as in the setting of PO intake vs wosening GVHD or BOOP vs
   other intrathoracic inflammatory process associated with his underlying
   malignancy.
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM for now, consider
   increasing tonight
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 4
   - Wean respiratory rate to target baseline pCO2 of 60-80
   - decrease sedation as tolerated
   - will likely require trach, plan for Monday at the moment
   # Bilateral pneumonia: Patient with worsening bilateral LL PNA
   complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to
   secretions, edema and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CTA. This is
   likely worsened in the setting of likely aspiration causing respiratory
   failure (as above) on [**3-4**] vs other inflammatory process (as above).
   Currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole and metronidazole (stated
   [**3-4**]) with infectious studies pending including glucan/galactomannan,
   blood cultures pending. [**3-4**] bronch revealed 3+ PMN
s but not organisms
   were seen.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 4
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray
   - f/u BAL cultures
   # Nutrition: Completed calorie counts, now with Dobhoff in place.
   Patient (+) at least 5L LOS.
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - cont TF
s, check for residuals
   - will diurese with IV lasix today
   - f/u pm lytes
   # Anemia: Hct down to currenlty stable at  26.0 today from 26.4
   yesterday but decreased from [**3-3**] when it was 34. Patient with baseline
   anemia of chronic inflammation and acute drop likely dilutional after
   fluid repletion as all cell counts down.
   - daily Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Active T&S
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Coags and LFT
s stable.
   - Trend LFT
s, coags
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg qAM, 10mg qPM
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Depression: In the context of prolonged ICU course and need for
   further interventions.
   - Followed by BMT social work.
   # Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH & free T4 from [**12/2161**]
   - Continue Levothyroxine 125mcg PO daily
   # Gastric varices:  Not likely bleeding as no blood in stomach after
   Dobhoff placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [date] and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated but required re-intubation after an aspiration event.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia (PNA), leading to chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He became hypoxic, tachycardic, and hypotensive, requiring re-intubation due to aspiration.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral lower lobe PNA complicated by distal bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon. This is likely worsened by aspiration causing respiratory failure. He is currently on antibiotics, and infectious studies are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 26.4% to 26.0% today, likely due to dilutional effects after"

   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated [**3-4**] after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA causing chronic
   hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-4**] required re-intubation after
   being on CPAP for 6 days.  This was thought to be secondary to
   witnessed aspiration event. Patient underwent bronchoscopy/BAL cultures
   are growing GN rods. Last ABG revealed metabolic alkalosis 7.49/55/38
   likely contraction alkalosis due to lasix gtt started [**3-4**].
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM for now
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 5
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - trach plan Monday at the moment
   # Bilateral pneumonia: Patient with worsening bilateral LL PNA
   complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to
   secretions, edema and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CTA. This was
   ikely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure (as above) on [**3-4**].
   Currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole and metronidazole (stated
   [**3-4**]). Bronchoscopy/BAL cultures are growing GN rods which could be
   consistent with aspiration or pseudomonal PNA.

   # Anemia: Hct down to currenlty stable at  26.0 today from 26.4
   yesterday but decreased from [**3-3**] when it was 34. Patient with baseline
   anemia of chronic inflammation and acute drop likely dilutional after
   fluid repletion as all cell counts down.

   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg qAM, 10mg qPM

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) post alloBMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) who is currently experiencing multi-organ GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO).

2. The patient presented with dyspnea (shortness of breath) and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated on [**2-26**] but required re-intubation on [**3-4**] after an aspiration event.

3. The patient has pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia (PNA) causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-4**], he required re-intubation after being on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) for 6 days.

4. Bronchoscopy/BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) cultures are growing GN (gram-negative) rods, which could be consistent with aspiration or pseudomonal PNA.

5. The patient has worsening bilateral lower lobe PNA complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema,"

   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated [**3-4**] after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA causing chronic
   hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-4**] required re-intubation after
   being on CPAP for 6 days.  This was thought to be secondary to
   witnessed aspiration event. Patient underwent bronchoscopy/BAL and
   cultures are growing GN rods. Last ABG revealed metabolic alkalosis
   7.49/55/38 likely contraction alkalosis due to lasix gtt started [**3-4**].
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM for now, consider
   increasing tonight
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 4
   - Wean respiratory rate to target baseline pCO2 of 60-80
   - decrease sedation as tolerated
   - will likely require trach, plan for Monday at the moment
   # Bilateral pneumonia: Patient with worsening bilateral LL PNA
   complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to
   secretions, edema and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CTA. This is
   likely worsened in the setting of likely aspiration causing respiratory
   failure (as above) on [**3-4**] vs other inflammatory process (as above).
   Currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole and metronidazole (stated
   [**3-4**]) with infectious studies pending including glucan/galactomannan,
   blood cultures pending. [**3-4**] bronch revealed 3+ PMN
s but not organisms
   were seen.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 4
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray
   - f/u BAL cultures
   # Nutrition: Completed calorie counts, now with Dobhoff in place.
   Patient (+) at least 5L LOS.
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - cont TF
s, check for residuals
   - will diurese with IV lasix today
   - f/u pm lytes
   # Anemia: Hct down to currenlty stable at  26.0 today from 26.4
   yesterday but decreased from [**3-3**] when it was 34. Patient with baseline
   anemia of chronic inflammation and acute drop likely dilutional after
   fluid repletion as all cell counts down.
   - daily Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Active T&S
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Coags and LFT
s stable.
   - Trend LFT
s, coags
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg qAM, 10mg qPM
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Depression: In the context of prolonged ICU course and need for
   further interventions.
   - Followed by BMT social work.
   # Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH & free T4 from [**12/2161**]
   - Continue Levothyroxine 125mcg PO daily
   # Gastric varices:  Not likely bleeding as no blood in stomach after
   Dobhoff placement.
   - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post alloBMT, complicated by multi-organ GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He required re-intubation after being on CPAP for 6 days due to a witnessed aspiration event. Cultures are growing GN rods. The patient's most recent ABG revealed metabolic alkalosis 7.49/55/38 likely contraction alkalosis due to Lasix gtt started on [**3-4**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral LL PNA complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CTA. This is likely worsened in the setting of likely aspiration causing respiratory failure on [**3-4**] vs other inflammatory process (as above).
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires re-intubation after being on CPAP for 6 days due to a witnessed aspiration event. He also has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the hospital unit due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [**2-26**] but required re-intubation on [**3-4**] after an aspiration event.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia (PNA). The recent aspiration event has worsened his respiratory status, leading to the need for re-intubation.

2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral lower lobe PNA complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CT angiogram. This is likely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure. The patient is currently on vancomycin/cefepime/voriconazole and metronidazole"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has underlying lung disease including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and pneumonia (PNA) which are contributing to chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. 

The patient was extubated on 2/26 but required re-intubation on 3/4 due to an aspiration event. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are growing gram-negative rods. The patient's most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.49, likely due to contraction alkalosis from the administration of lasix gtt started on 3/4.

The patient has bilateral pneumonia, complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). This is believed to be secondary to aspiration causing respiratory failure on 3/4. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, voriconazole, and metronidazole. The BAL cultures are growing gram-negative rods, which could be consistent with aspiration or pseudomonal PNA"

   38 yo male with NHL s/p allo-BMT complicated by GVHD and BOOP admitted
   with respiratory failure in large part attributable to obliterative
   bronchiolotis and muscle weakness in the setting of prolonged
   intubation.
   1)Respiratory Failure__this is related to significant obliterative
   bronchiolitis, some volume overload, possible continued pneumonia and
   aspiration event in the setting of modest weakness seen.
   -Cefepime/Vanco/Voriconazole/Flagyl all in place for bacterial and
   fungal infection with GNR
s seen on bronch
   -Fent 25, Versed 0.5
   -Obliterative Bronchoiolitis-Albuterol and treatment with
   mycophenilate/Prednisone continuing with Bactrim porphylaxis
   -Lasix in place to work to goal negative fluid balance today which has
   been achieved
we have elevated HCT at this time and exam is quite
   reasonable at this time for improved volume overload and now has had
   -2.1 liters this morning and will hold on lasix gtt and follow exam and
   oxygenation across the day.
   -Goal PCO2 is 55-60 which will be difficult in the setting of possible
   contraction alkalosis
   -Given the multifactorial issues at play and the poor tolerance of
   extubation prior will have to move to planned tracheostomy for Monday
   [**2162-3-8**].

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He was admitted with respiratory failure, primarily due to obliterative bronchiolitis and muscle weakness caused by prolonged intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/72 to 114/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube.

The patient has been receiving various medications including cefepime, vancomycin, voriconazole, metronidazole, and fentanyl. He also has Heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prevention. Other medications include furosemide for fluid management and midazolam for sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, his creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and his blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

   fluid collection (previously this was layering out). Pulmonary vascular
   markings are within normal limits. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal
   contours are normal. There is a feeding tube seen with the tip in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant, who presented with dyspnea and cough. He was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and required reintubation after an aspiration event. The patient's baseline lung disease includes GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia, which caused chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He underwent bronchoscopy/BAL, which was positive for ESBL Klebsiella. The patient is currently on meropenem, prednisone, and other medications. His current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumonia, fluid overload, anemia, liver cirrhosis/ascites, and hypothyroidism. The patient is planned for a bedside tracheostomy and thoracic surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia, along with the positive findings for ESBL Klebsiella, pose a risk for further respiratory distress and failure.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient's worsening bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon, may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential septicemia.
3. Fluid overload:"

   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**2162-2-4**], transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] because of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, extubated [**2-26**] & re-intubated [**3-4**] after aspiration
   event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA causing chronic
   hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-4**] required re-intubation after
   being on CPAP for 6 days.  This was thought to be secondary to
   witnessed aspiration event. Patient underwent bronchoscopy/BAL, gram GN
   rods. Last ABG revealed metabolic alkalosis 7.49/55/38 likely

   # Bilateral pneumonia: Patient with worsening bilateral LL PNA
   complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to
   secretions, edema and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-4**] CTA. This was
   likely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure (as above) on
   [**3-4**]. Currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole and metronidazole
   (started [**3-4**]). Bronchoscopy/BAL cultures are growing GN rods which
   could be consistent with aspiration or pseudomonal PNA. Beta glucan

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**]. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and required re-intubation after an aspiration event on [**3-4**]. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumonia, fluid overload, anemia, liver cirrhosis/ascites, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and medications for these conditions. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of bilateral pneumonia leading to sepsis, exacerbation of fluid overload resulting in congestive heart failure, further deterioration of anemia requiring transfusion, worsening of liver cirrhosis/ascites leading to hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding, and potential hypothyroidism-related complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory results to detect any changes or deteriorations in these conditions promptly. Additionally, appropriate adjustments in the treatment plan should be made based on the patient's response to therapy and any new developments."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a ventilator.
   - Antibiotics have been administered, including Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl, and Voriconazole.
   - Further adjustments to the antibiotic regimen will be made based on the results of a bronchoscopy culture.
   - Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs have been prescribed.
   - The patient will undergo tracheostomy tomorrow, with plans for a bedside tracheostomy.
   - Continuous airway pressure (A/C) support will continue.

2. Obliterative Bronchiolitis:
   - Mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone have been prescribed to manage this condition.
   - The patient is also being treated with MMF and Solumedrol for the component of obliterative bronchiolitis.

3. BMT:
   - The patient will continue to receive treatment with MMF and Solumdrol for the component of obliterative bronchiolitis.

ICU Care:
   - Nutrition: The discussion regarding PEG tube placement has been postponed due to concerns about ascites. The patient will continue with a nasogastric tube (NGT) for now.
   - Glycemic control measures are in place.
   - The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line and an arterial line.
   - Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are being implemented.

Overall, the patient's primary concern is persistent respiratory failure, and appropriate interventions have been initiated to manage this condition. The patient is also being treated for obliterative bronchiolitis and complications related to the BMT. ICU care is focused on supporting the patient's respiratory function, managing nutrition, maintaining glycemic control, and implementing prophylactic measures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**]. He has severe baseline lung disease, chronic CO2 retention, and multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient underwent bronchoscopy/BAL, which tested positive for ESBL Klebsiella. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has been weaned from sedation as tolerated. Tracheostomy was performed today by thoracic surgery, and coagulation studies and typing/sensitivity testing were done before the surgery. The patient's blood cultures are being followed, and galactomannan testing is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia, has resulted in chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He required re-intubation after a witnessed aspiration event on [**3-4**]. This suggests a high risk of recurrent aspiration and subsequent respiratory failure.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, likely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure on [**3-4**]. This increases the risk of progression to septic shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilatory support. The patient has been unsuccessful with extubation attempts and PSV weaning. A percutaneous tracheostomy has been planned and will be performed today. The patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies are provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a known pneumonia, which is a common complication in individuals with respiratory failure. This can be confirmed by the presence of Klebsiella in the sputum and the need for antibiotics.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up trials are being implemented to reduce this risk.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased circulation due to mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is being administered to prevent DVT.
4. Graft versus host disease (GVHD): As the patient is a BMT recipient, there is a risk of developing GVHD. Prophylaxis with Cellcept and Bactrim is being provided to prevent this complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [date] and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [date] but required re-intubation on [date] after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on [date] and is doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He required re-intubation after an aspiration event and is now on mechanical ventilation.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, which is likely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure. He is positive for ESBL Klebsiella and is being treated with meropenem.
3. Fluid overload: The patient may have fluid overload, but currently shows no evidence of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of electrolytes and signs of fluid overload is recommended.
4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia of chronic inflammation with a hematocrit of 27%. Daily monitoring of hematocrit is recommended"

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an alloBMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) complicated by multi-organ GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated but required re-intubation on [**3-4**] after an aspiration event.

The patient has severe baseline lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA (pneumonia) causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 143 K/uL, and serum creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. Blood cultures have grown ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with significant GVHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) and obliterative bronchiolitis. He underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy for chronic ventilatory failure. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella, for which he is being treated with meropenem.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be extubated soon. He is being weaned off sedatives such as versed/fentanyl and will be managed with PRN (as-needed) use for anxiety. The patient is also undergoing rehabilitation screening and will require discussion about placement location with his family.

In terms of medical complications, the patient has been diagnosed with GVHD, for which he is receiving prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and bactrim. Additionally, he is being treated with acyclovir following bone marrow transplantation.

ICU care for the patient includes tube feeds, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and various lines such as a PICC line and arterial line. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous UF heparin for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis includes head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), severe baseline lung disease, and chronic CO2 retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on 02/26 but required re-intubation on 03/04 after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on 03/08, and the patient is tolerating tracheostomy collar trials well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He required re-intubation due to an aspiration event and has a tracheostomy in place.

2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has bilateral lower lobe pneumonia complicated by distal bronchial obstruction due to secretions, edema, and adenopathy or phlegmon. This was likely due to aspiration causing respiratory failure.

3. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload, but currently shows no evidence of pulmonary edema. Monitoring of electrolytes and signs of fluid overload is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 56.3 kg male admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/74 mmHg to 114/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and lactate levels. The patient has a history of positive galactomannan test suggestive of Aspergillus infection, but negative beta-D-glucan results. The patient is receiving various medications including voriconazole, vancomycin, meropenem, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or abdominal examination findings. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) who presented with dyspnea and cough on 02/04/2162. He was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, extubated on 02/26/2162, and re-intubated on 03/04/2162 after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on 03/08/2162.

The patient reported a possible new aspiration event yesterday and has been experiencing mild improvement in right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation. He has been started empirically on Vancomycin and repeat chest X-ray (CXR) is pending. The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's medical history includes multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, pneumonia, anemia of chronic inflammation, liver cirrhosis/ascites, and hypothyroidism. He remains in remission from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His current medications include Cellcept, Bactrim, Acyclovir, Prednisone, and Levothyroxine.

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times, most recently on [**3-4**], after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on [**3-8**]. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support ever since. 

The patient reported a possible new aspiration event yesterday with transient low-grade fever, but the chest X-ray (CXR) showed only mild improvement in right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation. Sputum and blood cultures are pending. The patient's condition remains complicated by severe baseline lung disease, CO2 retention, and ongoing hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, voriconazole, prednisone, cellcept, bactrim, acyclovir, and levothyroxine. The patient's blood work shows anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 31.6%. The liver function tests (LFTs) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple complications including aspiration events, pneumonia, and hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. New Aspiration Event: The patient reported a possible new aspiration event yesterday. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential infections.
2. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support due to pre-existing lung disease, GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory failure and inadequate oxygenation.
3. Bilateral Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe consolidation that has not improved despite antibiotic treatment. This indicates a possible antibiotic-resistant infection or inadequate treatment, which can lead to worsening pneumonia and sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is 31.6, indicating anemia. If left untreated, it can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is in the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. They reported aspiration after the accidental removal of their NG tube and had a post-pyloric NG tube placed by an interventional radiologist. They are currently on vancomycin due to a temperature of 100.7. Prednisone has been decreased to 20mg PO daily per BMT recommendations. The patient is awaiting placement at Hospital1. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The chest X-ray shows a small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation, which may indicate an existing infection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient reported aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. The chest X-ray also shows right lower lobe consolidation, which has almost resolved, suggesting a previous episode of aspiration.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. They are receiving prophylactic SQ UF heparin to reduce this risk.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is on pantoprazole (Protonix) to prevent stress ulcers, which are common in critically ill patients.
5. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is hypercarbic respiratory failure, which requires careful monitoring and management of their ventilation parameters."

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with persistent ventilatory failure in the setting of obliterative bronchiolitis following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The patient has been on prolonged ventilator weaning and is being transitioned to another hospital for continued ventilator weaning.

The patient's medical history includes known klebsiella pneumonia, for which he is being treated with meropenem. There is also a significant pulmonary infiltrate, which has had limited resolution with previous anti-microbials, so voriconazole is being continued.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/68 mmHg to 128/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on SpO2.

Physical examination findings include thin general appearance, distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 5.5 to 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 137 to 216 K/uL, sodium level of 118 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes shortness of breath, anxiety, and depression. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 96/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,604 mL and output of 1,825 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 779 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 30.2%, platelet count of 143 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The patient's imaging shows no evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus, but there is diffuse density overlying the abdomen likely secondary to ascites. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a pulmonary diet, and the patient is receiving medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is ICU"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention, which complicates his condition.

The patient experienced aspiration events on March 4th and March 7th, resulting in reintubation and the placement of a tracheostomy on March 8th. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support and requires ongoing respiratory care.

His recent assessment shows improvement in left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation but still has right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation. The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, and blood cultures are pending. He is currently on meropenem and voriconazole for treatment.

Additionally, the patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 29%. He has liver cirrhosis and ascites likely secondary to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's liver function tests and coagulation profile are stable but have fluctuated throughout his admission.

The patient also has a history of hypothyroidism and gastric varices. He is currently on multiple medications including Cellcept, Bactrim, acyclovir, prednisone, and levothyroxine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) status post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) who is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated on [**2-26**] but required reintubation on [**3-4**] after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on [**3-8**].

The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support in the context of resolving pneumonia and a possible new aspiration event. There are no signs of pulmonary edema. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 96/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neurological assessment is not detailed in the note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. The patient has chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular weakness, which are contributing to his respiratory issues. He has been placed on a tracheostomy and is undergoing ventilatory weaning. The patient also has leukocytosis, GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), and diarrhea, but there is no evidence of C. diff infection. He is being treated with various medications including Meropenem, Voriconazole, and Bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular weakness put him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and continued efforts towards weaning from the ventilator are necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammatory response. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. GVHD: The patient's symptoms of GVHD, such as diarrhea and leukocytosis, should be closely monitored and managed with immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Obstructive Bronchiolitis: The patient's imaging shows persistent mix of effusion and collapse in the left lower lobe, indicating obstructive bronchiolitis. This condition can lead to further respiratory compromise and may require additional interventions.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's main complaint is shortness of breath. The patient has a history of depression and anxiety.

During the 24-hour period, the patient was restarted on multivitamins, did not have a bed available at Hospital1, and may get one on Monday. The patient's BMT wants to start rituxan on Saturday, and the patient had tracheostomy collar for an hour in the morning. There were discussions about possible IVIg for GVHD, as the patient has received it in the past.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 03/11/2162 at 08:15 AM, voriconazole on 03/11/2162 at 09:26 PM, acyclovir on 03/12/2162 at 08:30 PM, and meropenem on 03/13/2162 at 05:57 AM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. Other medications include unspecified changes to medical and family history.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm (with a normal range of 93-123 bpm), blood pressure of 93/56 mmHg (with a normal range of "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially extubated on February 26th but required re-intubation on March 4th after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on March 8th, which he is tolerating well. The patient continues to require respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He requires ongoing respiratory support and may be at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral pneumonia, with consolidation in the right lower lobe almost resolved but unchanged in the left lower lobe. This indicates ongoing infection and potential complications related to the respiratory system.
3. Aspiration events: The patient has experienced multiple aspiration events, which can lead to further lung infections and complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Anemia: The patient has a stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is currently experiencing complications from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [**2162-2-4**] and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been intubated multiple times, most recently on [**3-4**] after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was performed on [**3-8**], and the patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 12/5. The patient has also been treated for resistant Klebsiella pneumonia with meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure with recent aspiration event: The patient's pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia, continues to cause chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient required re-intubation after being on CPAP for 6 days following an aspiration event. The tracheostomy placed on [**3-8**] has been well-tolerated, but the patient continues to require PSV 12/5. There is a possibility of another aspiration event or worsening respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on February 26th but re-intubated on March 4th after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on March 8th, and the patient is currently on treatment for resistant Klebsiella with meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration event: The patient reported a possible new aspiration event from an accidental disconnection from the ventilator. Although he is afebrile and without leukocytosis, this remains a concern and should be monitored closely.
2. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient continues to require pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and the need for ongoing respiratory support.
3. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, with consolidation in the right lower lobe almost resolved"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with GVH, bronchiolitis, recent pneumonia, and has undergone tracheostomy. Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient is tolerating short-term tracheostomy collar trials and ambulated with assistance. Lab results show stable hemoglobin levels, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and prophylactic medications. The patient's nutritional intake is being met through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and recent pneumonia put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy-related infections.
2. Bleeding Disorders: The elevated INR and prolonged PTT suggest a coagulation disorder, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests indicate possible liver dysfunction, which could be related to GVH or other underlying conditions. This may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
4. Nutritional Deficiencies: Prolonged tube feeding can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly managed. Monitoring the patient's nutritional status and ensuring adequate intake is essential.

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  Patient noted
   increased dyspnea starting approximately 2 hours after retuximab
   infusion yesterday.  Infusion given per protocol albeit he noted this
   was faster than previously done.  No symptoms reported during the
   infusion.  Feels breathing is a bit better this am.  Exam unchanged, no
   increased FiO2 requirements
   Agree with detailed assessment and plan as above.  Completing course of
   meropenim today for Klebsiella in sputum.  Continue prednisone as per
   BMT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). He presented with dyspnea and cough on 02/04/2162 and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He required re-intubation on 03/04 after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on 03/08, and he is currently on treatment for resistant Klebsiella pneumonia with meropenem. His current condition includes hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumonia, anemia, liver cirrhosis/ascites, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in remission. He is being managed with multiple medications including prednisone, meropenem, voriconazole, and others as per the treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying lung disease and ongoing infection. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Aspiration events: Given the patient's recent aspiration event leading to re-intubation, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration events. Ensuring proper positioning and airway protection measures are in place is crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He has been experiencing multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), which have resulted in severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on February 26th but required re-intubation on March 4th after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on March 8th, and the patient is currently tolerating it well while requiring pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 12 cmH2O. The patient's recent CXR showed improvement, indicating resolution of right lower lobe consolidation. However, there is still an area of consolidation in the left lower lobe, which may be due to distal bronchial obstruction seen on the CT angiogram (CTA) from March 4th. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with meropenem and voriconazole.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough. The patient has a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currently being treated for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with rituximab. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 117/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. The patient's weight has increased from 48.4 kg at admission to 56.3 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,873 mL, including 594 mL given orally, 1,083 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 790 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 770 mL of urine and 230 mL of blood products. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated AST and ALT levels.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 227 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 137 K/uL. Renal function is relatively preserved, with serum creatinine levels ranging from 0.2-0."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT). He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), along with severe baseline lung disease and carbon dioxide retention. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on February 4th and was transferred to the hospital unit due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on February 26th but required re-intubation on March 4th after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on March 8th.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He continues to require pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is dependent on the ventilator.

2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation that is almost resolved, but the left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation remains unchanged. This could indicate a persistent infection or segmental bronchial obstruction.

3. Klebsiella infection: The patient has been treated with meropenem for an infection caused by extended-s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to multi-organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and severe baseline lung disease. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough on [date] and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated on [date] but required reintubation on [date] after an aspiration event. A tracheostomy was placed on [date]. The patient is currently on treatment for resistant Klebsiella pneumonia with meropenem and is also receiving Rituxan for GVHD. He continues to require pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a rate of 12/5. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's pre-existing lung disease, including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and previous pneumonia, contribute to chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The need for re-intubation indicates a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has consolidation in the right lower lobe (RLL) which is almost resolved, but the left lower lobe (LLL) shows no change, suggesting a possible infection or obstruction in that area.
3. Klebsiella pneumonia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) and is now presenting with several medical complications.

1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has pre-existing lung disease including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bronchiolitis obliterans, and pneumonia (PNA) causing chronic hypercarbic respiratory distress. He required reintubation after an aspiration event and continues to require pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to ongoing respiratory distress.

2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray on [**3-10**] showed resolution of right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation but no change in the appearance of left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, which is consistent with distal bronchial obstruction seen on [**3-4**] computed tomography angiography (CTA). Blood cultures from [**3-4**] were positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella.

3. Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube and will defer full swallow evaluation until rehabilitation. The nutrition team will provide further recommendations.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 30.1%, which is stable. He has baseline anemia of chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/80 to 129/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube, using a mode of ventilation that includes mandatory minute volume (MMV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and autoflow. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound from March 15th reveals ascites, likely causing the thickened gallbladder wall, mildly echogenic kidneys suggesting chronic kidney disease, and no acute abdominal process. The patient has a history of antibiotic use, including voriconazole and meropenem.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are also within normal limits.

Microbiology tests are pending for blood cultures and sputum gram stain. Imaging studies include an abdominal ultrasound performed on March 15th, which showed ascites, chronic kidney disease, and no acute"

   38 yo male with GVHD and obliterative bronchiolitis now with persistent
   respiratory failure and moving to chronic ventilator weaning facility
   for care at this time. We have limitation to weaning of obstructive
   lung disease---he has had some substantial limitation in capacity for
   expiratory flow and with tachypnea this may be made worse with dynamic
   hyperinflation.  This is further complicated by some mild retriction
   from abdominal distention and mild ascites which we hope to have
   response to diuretics with continued treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of GVHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) and obliterative bronchiolitis, currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. He has been moved to a chronic ventilator weaning facility for further care. The patient has limitations in weaning due to obstructive lung disease, substantial limitation in expiratory flow, tachypnea, dynamic hyperinflation, mild restriction from abdominal distention, and mild ascites. Treatment includes continuing with PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation), tracheostomy mask trials as tolerated, suctioning as needed, and ongoing management of GVHD. The patient is also scheduled for rehabilitation at a different hospital and will be transferred to a long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure poses a significant risk. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to obstructive lung disease, tachypnea, dynamic hyperinflation, and abdominal distention.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Proper measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system bedside index (RSBI) will be crucial in preventing VAP.
3. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): The patient's history of GVHD requires ongoing management to prevent further complications"
