   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end
   stage COPD who presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in
   the setting of rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the
   MICU for worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He is transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.  Decision made to intubate pt in PM of [**2-18**] for increasing
   respiratory distress.  No complications of intubation.  CXR with ETT in
   good position, remains severely hyperinflated.
   - continue intubation for now, anticipate that pt will remain intubated
   for potentially prolonged course.
   - given hypotension found on [**Last Name (LF) 939**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] lighten sedation to off until
   BP issues resolved.  Was sedated well with fentanyl/versed
   - continue high dose steroids with methylprednisolone 125 mg IV TID
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - continue azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
   - will do sputum culture gm stain/cx/PCP/fungal cx today from ETT
   aspirate
   - will check LDH given concern for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cont to follow ABG
s while intubated
   - will hold off on CT chest for now
   .
   Hypotension:  Found to be hypotensive on morning [**Name Initial (PRE) 939**].  With
   combination of UOP decreasing as well as sedation for intubation and
   overall positive pressure ventilation, likely related to hypovolemia.
   - IVF boluses, assess for response.
   - at this point, pt requires [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] plan to place today
   - cont HD monitoring with a-line in place
   HIV:  Patient with recent virologic breakthrough and decrease in CD4
   count to below 200.  Has been on bactrim prophylaxis.  Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 266**].
   - continue home HIV regimen
   - continue bactrim at prophylaxis doses
   COPD:  As above, end stage disease with FEV1 of 0.5 which is 20%
   predicted.  He is on [**12-21**] liters home oxygen.  His outpatient
   pulmonologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**].
   - holding spiriva
   - receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebluizers
   - azithromycin day 3
   - pulse dose solumedrol
   - intubated
   - will contact [**Name (NI) 267**] pulmonologist/PCP concerning new intubation and
   potential course of patient
   .
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures elevated currently in the setting of
   respiratory distress.
   - continue doxazosin
   GERD: Stable.
   - continue H2 blocker
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit is 36.  Currently at 31.4 without signs of
   active bleeding.

His blood pressure has been a concern, and he required fluid boluses. He has a history of HIV, for which he is on home HIV regimen and bactrim prophylaxis. He also has end-stage COPD and is on home oxygen. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, but he is still hypotensive. The plan is to continue intubation for now and anticipate potential prolonged intubation. He will be sedated with fentanyl/versed, and his ABG will be monitored. He will also receive methylprednisolone, azithromycin, ipratropium, and albuterol nebulizers. Sputum culture and LDH will be checked, and a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 35-year-old male admitted to the MICU for increasing respiratory distress. The patient required non-invasive ventilation during the day and increased work of breathing at night, leading to intubation without complications in the evening. An arterial line was placed, and the patient did well on the ventilator overnight. Sedation with fentanyl and versed was administered, and hydralazine was given for blood pressure control.

The patient received various medications including lorazepam, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ranitidine (prophylaxis), midazolam (versed), and propofol. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/67 mmHg to 128/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted. The patient was on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to hemodynamic instability and an unstable airway. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 64 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 95, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 317.

The patient's laboratory results included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 32.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 201 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, chronic, and HIV (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, arterial line monitoring, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end
   stage COPD who presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in
   the setting of rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the
   MICU for worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He is transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.
   - continue high dose steroids with methylprednisolone 135 mg IV TID
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - continue azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
   - sputum gram stain and culture if produces sample
   - will check LDH given concern for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] transfer to MICU for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
   - repeat ABG on BIPAP
   HIV:  Patient with recent virologic breakthrough and decrease in CD4
   count to below 200.  Has been on bactrim prophylaxis.  Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 266**].
   - continue home HIV regimen
   - continue bactrim at prophylaxis doses
   COPD:  As above, end stage disease with FEV1 of 0.5 which is 20%
   predicted.  He is on [**12-21**] liters home oxygen.  His outpatient
   pulmonologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**].
   - holding spiriva
   - receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebluizers
   - azithromycin day 3
   - pulse dose solumedrol
   - BIPAP
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures elevated currently in the setting of
   respiratory distress.
   - continue doxazosin
   GERD: Stable.
   - continue H2 blocker
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit is 36.  Currently at 31.4 without signs of
   active bleeding.
   - continue to monitor
   Chronic back pain: Stable
   - home tylenol with codeine as needed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of HIV and end-stage COPD who presented with worsening shortness of breath and was transferred to the MICU for worsening respiratory distress. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Barotrauma: The high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressure may lead to barotrauma, which is damage to the lung tissue caused by excessive pressure.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Similar to barotrauma, high levels of airway pressures can cause VILI, resulting in further lung damage.
4. Pneumothorax: The positive pressures used during mechanical ventilation can potentially dislodge any existing blebs or areas of weakened lung tissue, leading to pneumothorax.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or bacterial infections.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and history of potential cardiac ischemia raise concerns for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
7. Bleeding: The use of anticoagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end stage COPD who
   presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of
   rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the MICU for
   worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He was transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.  Decision made to intubate pt in PM of [**2-18**] for increasing
   respiratory distress.  No complications of intubation.  CXR with ETT in
   good position, remains severely hyperinflated.
   - continue intubation for now, will attempt to lighten sedation and try
   SBT today.
   - wean steroids, methylprednisolone, to 60 mg IV BID
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - s/p azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
   - f/u sputum culture, gm stain/cx/PCP/fungal cx from ETT aspirate
   - cont to follow ABG
s while intubated
   - will hold off on CT chest for now
   - will need to touch base with family regarding goals of care.
   Hypotensive episodes:  Found to be hypotensive on morning rounds.  With
   combination of UOP decreasing as well as sedation for intubation and
   overall positive pressure ventilation, likely related to hypovolemia.
   - IVF boluses as needed, assess for response.
   - pt received CVL due to concern for hypotension yesterday
   - cont HD monitoring with a-line in place
   HIV:  Patient with recent virologic breakthrough and decrease in CD4
   count to below 200.  Has been on bactrim prophylaxis.  Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 266**].
   - continue home HIV regimen
   - continue bactrim at prophylaxis doses
   COPD:  As above, end stage disease with FEV1 of 0.5 which is 20%
   predicted.  He is on [**12-21**] liters home oxygen.  His outpatient
   pulmonologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**].
   - holding spiriva
   - receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebluizers
   - s/p azithromycin
   - pulse dose solumedrol
   - intubated
   - will contact [**Name (NI) 267**] pulmonologist/PCP concerning new intubation and
   potential course of patient
   .
   Hypertension:  With weaning of sedation, the patient does record
   elevated blood pressures
   - will continue doxazosin, can consider other medications in future is
   BP remains elevated.
   GERD: Stable.
   - continue H2 blocker
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit is 36.  Currently in low 30
s without
   signs of active bleeding.
   - continue to monitor
   Chronic back pain: Stable
   - home tylenol with codeine as needed
   FEN:  NPO currently due to intubation, will consider feeding tube and
   consult nutrition if cannot be extubated soon.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with HIV and end-stage COPD who presented with worsening shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, and productive cough. He was transferred to the MICU for worsening respiratory distress. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has chronic respiratory acidosis, and his ABG shows an increased work of breathing and distress. The likely etiology of his symptoms is a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral infection. Other concerns include cardiac ischemia, pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections), and pulmonary embolism.

The patient was found to be hypotensive on morning rounds, which was likely due to hypovolemia related to positive pressure ventilation. IVF boluses were given as needed, and the patient received a central venous line due to concern for hypotension. The patient's HIV regimen and bactrim prophylaxis should be continued. His COPD management includes holding Spiriva, receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers, taking azithromycin, and pulse dose solumedrol.

The patient's blood pressure has been elevated with weaning of sedation, so doxazosin will be continued, and other medications may be considered if the blood pressure remains elevated. His GERD is stable, and H2 blocker will be continued. Anemia is present without signs of active bleeding, and monitoring will continue. Chronic back"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end stage COPD who
   presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of
   rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the MICU for
   worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He is transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.  Decision made to intubate pt in PM of [**2-18**] for increasing
   respiratory distress.  No complications of intubation.  CXR with ETT in
   good position, remains severely hyperinflated.
   - continue intubation for now, anticipate that pt will remain intubated
   for potentially prolonged course.
   - given hypotension found on [**Last Name (LF) 939**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] lighten sedation to off until
   BP issues resolved.  Was sedated well with fentanyl/versed
   - continue high dose steroids with methylprednisolone 125 mg IV TID
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - continue azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
   - will do sputum culture gm stain/cx/PCP/fungal cx today from ETT
   aspirate
   - will check LDH given concern for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cont to follow ABG
s while intubated
   - will hold off on CT chest for now
   .
   Hypotension:  Found to be hypotensive on morning [**Name Initial (PRE) 939**].  With
   combination of UOP decreasing as well as sedation for intubation and
   overall positive pressure ventilation, likely related to hypovolemia.
   - IVF boluses, assess for response.
   - at this point, pt requires [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] plan to place today
   - cont HD monitoring with a-line in place
   HIV:  Patient with recent virologic breakthrough and decrease in CD4
   count to below 200.  Has been on bactrim prophylaxis.  Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 266**].
   - continue home HIV regimen
   - continue bactrim at prophylaxis doses
   COPD:  As above, end stage disease with FEV1 of 0.5 which is 20%
   predicted.  He is on [**12-21**] liters home oxygen.  His outpatient
   pulmonologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**].
   - holding spiriva
   - receiving ipratropium and albuterol nebluizers
   - azithromycin day 3
   - pulse dose solumedrol
   - intubated
   - will contact [**Name (NI) 267**] pulmonologist/PCP concerning new intubation and
   potential course of patient
   .
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures elevated currently in the setting of
   respiratory distress.
   - continue doxazosin
   GERD: Stable.
   - continue H2 blocker
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit is 36.  Currently at 31.4 without signs of
   active bleeding.
   - continue to monitor
   Chronic back pain: Stable
   - home tylenol with codeine as needed
   FEN:  NPO currently due to intubation, will place feeding tube and
   consult nutrition

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with HIV and end-stage COPD who presented with worsening shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management and was intubated due to increasing respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The ABG results indicate chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated. The patient has a low oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen, and his respiratory rate is within normal limits.

The physical examination reveals poor air movement bilaterally, scarce wheezes bilaterally, mild inspiratory crackles at bases, hyperexpansion, warm and well-perfused extremities, and no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), decreased platelet count (Plt), and normal liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolyte levels. The patient's CD4 count is 183, indicating a compromised immune system.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral infection. Other concerns for respiratory distress include cardiac ischemia, pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections due to the low CD4 count), and pulmonary embolism. The patient is being treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, along with HIV/AIDS. The patient was admitted to the ICU for an acute exacerbation of respiratory failure due to COPD.

During the stay in the ICU, the patient underwent invasive ventilation and had an arterial line placed. The patient's medications were adjusted, including decreasing the dose of methylprednisolone to 60mg IV BID and extubation. The patient expressed a desire to be DNR but wanted to be intubated if needed, and desired to avoid prolonged treatment for irreversible causes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/90 to 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and ranitidine.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 716 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a nasal cannula with PSV/SBT ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 15 breaths per minute, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and RS"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end stage COPD who
   presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of
   rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the MICU for
   worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He was transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.  Decision made to intubate pt in PM of [**2-18**] for increasing

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with HIV and end stage COPD who
   presented [**2152-2-15**] with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of
   rhinorrhea and productive cough now transferred to the MICU for
   worsening respiratory distress.
   Respiratory Distress:  Oxygenating well on nasal canula.  ABG shows
   chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated but on exam he
   has increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use and distress. The
   most likely etiology of his symptoms is COPD exacerbation in the
   setting of viral infection.  Other concerns for respiratory distress
   include cardiac ischemia (unlikely without chest pain or EKG changes),
   pulmonary infection (including opportunistic infections with CD4 count
   of 183) and pulmonary embolism.  He was transferred to the MICU for a
   trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and possible
   intubation.  Decision made to intubate pt in PM of [**2-17**] for increasing
   respiratory distress.  No complications of intubation.  CXR with ETT in
   good position, remains severely hyperinflated.  Extubated on [**2-19**] with
   no complications post-extubation.  Much improved respiratory status
   today
   - cont to wean steroids, will cont dose from yesterday at
   methylprednisolone 60 mg IV BID
   - insulin sliding scale while on steroids
   - s/p azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
   - ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers
   - f/u sputum culture, gm stain/cx/PCP/fungal cx from ETT aspirate
   - will hold off on CT chest for now
   Hypotensive episodes:  Found to be hypotensive on morning rounds on
   [**2-18**].  With combination of UOP decreasing as well as sedation for
   intubation and overall positive pressure ventilation, likely related to
   hypovolemia.
   - IVF boluses as needed, assess for response.
   - cont CVP monitoring
   - cont HD monitoring with a-line in place
   HIV:  Patient with recent virologic breakthrough and decrease in CD4
   count to below 200.  Has been on bactrim prophylaxis.  Followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 266**].
   - continue home HIV regimen
   - continue bactrim at prophylaxis doses
   COPD:  As above, end stage disease with FEV1 of 0.5 which is 20%
   predicted.  He is on [**12-21**] liters home oxygen.  His outpatient
   pulmonologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**].  Patient intubated on [**2-17**] for worsening
   respiratory distress and extubated on [**2-19**] without complications.
   - holding spiriva
   - cont ipratropium and albuterol nebluizers
   - s/p azithromycin
   - pulse dose solumedrol, cont at 60mg IV BID for today
   Hypertension:  Elevated BP with agitation.  Labile with sedation.
   - will continue doxazosin, can consider other medications in future is
   BP remains elevated.
   GERD: Stable.
   - continue H2 blocker
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit is 36.  Currently in low 30
s without
   signs of active bleeding.
   - continue to monitor
   Chronic back pain: Stable
   - morphine PRN
   - home tylenol with codeine as needed
   FEN:  NPO.
   Access: R IJ CVL, Peripherals, a-line
   Prophylaxis: heparin SQ
   Code: DNR, wants short course intubation.
   Communication: Patient, family
   Disposition:  plan call-out to floor today, much improved after short
   course intubatin.
