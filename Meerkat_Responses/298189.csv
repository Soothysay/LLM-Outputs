   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Most likely lower GI bleed given BRBPR with relative hemodynamic
   stability.  Likely causes include CDiff colitis, diverticulosis, AVM,
   mesenteric
   -          s/p 2 units with appropriate bump in HCT
   -          can monitor HCTs [**Hospital1 **] today
   -          f/u with GI re: ? deferring scope given cardiac
   comorbidities. If rebleeds and now scope, will have to pursue tagged
   RBC study or angioembolization
   -          change PPI to po lansoprazole daily
   -          trend INR. Elevation is thought to be nutritionally related.
   Could give Vitamin K but ? concern re clotting and coronary disease. If
   actively bleeding can consider FFP. Regardless, this INR is not high
   enough to be contributing to his bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a thin, elderly, pale, cachectic male with a chief complaint of BRBPR (blood responsible for the brownish appearance of the urine). The patient received 2 units of blood after arrival to the floor and was given 40mg IV Lasix x 2 with each transfusion. At 3:30 AM, the patient complained of shortness of breath with mild chest pain. The EKG showed no acute changes and was resolved with 2 sl nitro tabs and 5mg IV metoprolol. The patient has allergies to penicillins, facial swelling; sulfa (sulfonamides), rash; ciprofloxacin, rash; and levaquin (oral) (levofloxacin), rash. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**3-10**]. The patient has been receiving various infusions and other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 79 bpm (60-88), blood pressure of 148/93 mmHg (105-162/59-100), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (15-28), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 61 kg (admission: 58 kg) and height is 65 inches."

","Summary:
The patient is a thin, elderly, pale, cachectic male who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in blood loss and a need for a blood transfusion. He has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and previous C. difficile infection. The patient's current medical conditions include gastrointestinal bleed, coronary artery disease, C. difficile infection, heart failure, chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, dysphagia, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is still experiencing some cardiac issues and has an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation was with gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further blood loss and potential complications such as hypotension and shock.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen due to fluid shifts and blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may progress if there is acute kidney injury or if the current condition exacerbates his renal function.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is currently on antibiotics, which increases the risk of developing other infections, especially in a hospitalized setting.
6. Hypernatremia: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and they have a history of lower GIB. The patient is a poor candidate for any procedures, but if bleeding continues, they may need a tagged cell scan and possibly angiography.

The patient also has acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as indicated by enzymes slowly trending down. The patient is not taking aspirin due to the risk of bleeding and is being aggressively diuresed to decrease oxygen consumption. The patient remains on a nitro patch and is receiving treatment for congestive heart failure (CHF), which may help improve their condition.

The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), C. difficile infection (C. diff), chronic renal failure (CRF), hypernatremia (high sodium levels), and hypertensive urgency. There is also mention of a transfusion mismatch, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and benign hypertension.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and has had two lines inserted - a PICC line on 03/09/2128 and an 18-gauge line on 03/10/2128. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis"

   Code status: per discussion with patient, now DNR/DNI
   Disposition: appreciate pall care input re : home or [**Hospital 554**] hospice care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by hematochezia (blood in stools), BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood cells in the urine), and a low hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL. The patient's cardiac status is a concern for further invasive procedures such as an endoscopy.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has had two episodes of chest pain, which were resolved with nitroglycerin and morphine. The EKG at 1 AM on 3/12 showed no acute changes but did indicate a prior anteroseptal infarct. The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial damage.

3. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, as evidenced by symptoms of fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient is on beta-blockers, diuretics, and morphine as tolerated.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which may have contributed to the recent ACS episode. The patient is already on aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's serum glucose levels have been low, requiring administration of D50 to correct hypoglycemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of BRBPR (blood-tinged or brownish red sputum), recent NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction), and chest pain. The patient has a history of penicillin and sulfa allergies, as well as rashes from ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 60 to 89 bpm, blood pressure between 73/13 mmHg and 112/76 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13 and 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and cachectic appearance, poor dentition, and the presence of an NG tube. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Respiratory examination notes no crackles or diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities reveal 2+ lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive and able to follow simple commands, but movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry reveals elevated creat"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and the patient is currently experiencing ongoing bleeding with a suspected diverticular bleed. Other significant findings include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary artery disease (CAD), Clostridium difficile infection, chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, dysphagia, hypertension, and hypoglycemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is still experiencing ongoing bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient may continue to have episodes of chest pain due to ACS, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient's underlying CAD could worsen, leading to further ischemic events and potential cardiac complications.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: If not effectively treated, the infection could progress and result in worsening colitis, sepsis, and possibly death.
5. Chronic heart failure: The patient's pre-existing heart condition may deteriorate due to fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and cardiac arrest.
6. Chronic renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood cells in the urine) and NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including gastrointestinal bleed, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, C. difficile infection, heart failure, chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate of 103 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 133/69 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal range at 19 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on 6 liters of nasal cannula. The temperature is within normal range at 36.8 degrees Celsius.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is not well-nourished, thin, pale, frail, and cachectic. There are no crackles in the chest, and the patient has trace bilateral hand edema. The abdominal examination shows that the abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive and follows simple commands.

The lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. There are also elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as decreased levels of albumin and magnesium. The troponin-T level is elevated, indicating myocardial injury."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of BRBPR (blood-tinged or brownish-red pleural effusion) and NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's condition has been improving in the ICU, with stabilization of vital signs and reduction in interstitial edema. However, the patient still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by hematochezia, BRBPR, and GI bleed. The patient's cardiac status is a concern for further invasive procedures like endoscopy. The plan is to maintain dual access with a PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) and EJ (likely referring to an existing IV line), continue daily PPI (proton pump inhibitor), and trend INR (international normalized ratio) to keep below 1.5.

2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient continues to improve with ongoing treatment for acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The plan includes continuing beta blockers, prn Lasix and morphine as tolerated by blood pressure, and monitoring I/Os (intake/output) and daily weights.

3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), Unstable Angina, Coronary Ischemia: The patient had a NSTEMI on 02/28 and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of BRBPR (blood-tinged brown-colored sputum), NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), and hypoglycemia. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate) and plans are in place for discharge with hospice care.

The patient has a history of EtOH (ethanol) abuse and presents with multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, hypoglycemia, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, dysphagia, and hypertension.

Key findings from the physical examination include poor dentition, presence of an NG (nasogastric) tube, symmetric chest expansion with diminished breath sounds at the bilateral bases, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, 2+ bilateral hand edema, and muscle wasting. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior with the ability to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), elevated blood glucose levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals moderate bilateral pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man who presented to the hospital with septic shock, C. difficile infection, and a possible NSTEMI. He was started on a heparin drip and then developed bronchospasm and respiratory distress, leading to his transfer to the ICU. The patient's condition has improved and he was later transferred to the floor, but he triggered for pulmonary edema and was readmitted to the ICU. He has had episodes of bronchospasm but stable hematocrit. He also experiences intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath, which responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine. The patient's allergies include penicillins, facial swelling; sulfa (sulfonamides), rash; ciprofloxacin, rash; and levofloxacin, rash. His last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole. The patient is currently on various medications including furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), morphine sulfate, and a nitroglycerin patch.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which can be a life-threatening complication if not managed properly.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's intermittent chest pain and coronary ischemia indicate a possible ACS, which requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent further complications.
3. Heart failure: The patient has acute on"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of septic shock, C. difficile infection, and a possible NSTEMI. He presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis, and C. difficile. The patient was initially treated with heparin and developed bronchospasm, leading to the initiation of bronchodilators. He was transferred to the ICU and experienced episodes of blood-tinged brownish-red secretions (BRBPR). The patient also had intermittent chest pain, which responded to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) and morphine. He underwent colonoscopy, which revealed severe colitis. The patient has expressed his desire for do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and wishes to set up home hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of GIB puts him at risk for further bleeding events, which could lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's intermittent chest pain suggests ongoing ischemia, indicating a potential risk for myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient's recent completion of a 14-day course of Flagyl indicates that he may still be susceptible to recurrence or complications related to the infection, such as colitis.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. He is currently experiencing bradyrhizial bloody purge (BRBPR), chest pain, shortness of breath (SOB), sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and episodes of ventricular trigeminy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 mmHg to 142/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate for pain control, nitroglycerin, and oral ativan.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with elevated sodium, potassium, and phosphorus levels.

The patient's plan includes continuing PPI therapy, monitoring and transfusing for low hemoglobin levels, maintaining an INR below 1.5, and treating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with beta blockers, morphine, and nitroglycerin patch and sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient is not a candidate for"

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo man with ongoing GI bleed and NSTEMI [**2-28**].
   Goals of care discussed with family (wife [**Name (NI) 16**] and grandson [**Doctor First Name 241**] as
   well as with patient.  They agree that they would like him to get home
   with hospice but that they do not want him to suffer in the meantime.
   After meeting with the family, patient, and the attending, the patient
   was made CMO with the hope of transitioning him to home with hospice.

   -          continue PPI
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   -          patient had NSTEMI [**2-28**] at OSH
   -          EKG continues to show ischemic changes
   -          Continue beta blocker as tachycardia appears to trigger
   chest pain
   -          started fentanyl patch in addition to morphine boluses;
   family amenable to morphine gtt if needed
   -          Continue statin and NTG patch and SL NTG
   # Tachycardia:
   -          appears to improve with pain control; alternatively,
   tachycardia is causing worsening chest pain by worsening cardiac
   ischemia
   -          will look into ways to deliver beta blockade at home besides
   PO or IV route

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a chief complaint of bloody brown rice-like colored sputum (BRBPR) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been experiencing chest pain on multiple occasions and has been given various treatments including morphine, nitroglycerin, and ativan. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, and he has been having episodes of ventricular trigeminy. His physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds with good air movement, and he has been intubated with an NG tube which was later pulled due to clogging. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. His medical history includes hypertension, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's family has agreed to hospice care at home but wishes for him not to suffer in the meantime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleed and is not a candidate for colonoscopy or angiography due to his cardiac status and patient wishes. He will continue receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient had an NSTEMI at OSH and continues to show ischemic changes on EKG. He will be managed with beta-blockers, statins, nitroglycerin"

- The patient experienced chest pain on 03/13/2128 at 09:01 AM and again at 04:33 PM.
- The patient's blood pressure has been low, requiring IV fluid boluses.
- The patient's sodium level remains high despite attempts to correct it.
- The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and required frequent deep suctioning.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications, including morphine sulfate, nitroglycerin patch, and fentanyl patch.
- The patient's respiratory system is compromised, with dyspnea and tachypnea.
- The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.
- The patient's weight is 59.7 kg, with a height of 65 inches.
- The patient has received a total of 2,744 mL of fluids since 12 AM, including 1,324 mL of total input through the gastrointestinal tract, 490 mL of IV fluids, and 210 mL of blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing or at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient initially presented with GIB, which is an ongoing concern. The bleeding may continue, leading to further blood loss and potential complications.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's recent NSTEMI indicates underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). ACS can progress to more severe conditions such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction, increasing the risk of cardiac complications.

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's worsening condition, including increased shortness of breath and edematous extremities, suggests acute decompensated heart failure. This can lead to further respiratory distress and compromised cardiac output.

4. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

5. Hypernatremia: Despite efforts to correct the sodium imbalance, the patient remains hypernatremic. This can lead to neurological complications and further organ dysfunction.

6. C. difficile Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use increases the risk for C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis and complications such as sepsis.

7. Tranfusion Mismatch: The patient received blood products, and there is a possibility of a transfusion mismatch, which"
