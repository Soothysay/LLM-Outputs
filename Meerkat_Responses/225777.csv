   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with confusion, respiratory failure, and worsening weakness, somnolence, and hypercapnia. She has a history of multiple medical conditions including breast cancer, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been in and out of the hospital/rehab since 2011 and was recently discharged from another hospital. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing episodes of delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires continued ventilator support. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to hypoventilation caused by poor mental status and thick secretions from the tracheostomy tube.

2. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and may contribute to her current delirium and overall condition.

3. Anasarca/Diastolic CHF/Cor Pulmonale: The patient presents with extreme trace edema and signs of fluid overload. There is a risk of worsening diastolic heart failure and cor pulmonale, which can further compromise her respiratory function.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a"

   until then she was only ventilated at night. She lived independently as
   recently as earlier this year. Other issues have inclued worsening
   anasarca, diarrhea.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with confusion and respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, breast cancer, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and other medical conditions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48 mmHg to 142/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and tidal volume of 450 mL. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is at 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 239 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level (Hct) of 26.7%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 239 K/uL, increased creatinine level (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals cardiomegaly, large pulmonary arteries, patchy infiltrates, and likely pleural effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, malnutrition, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia, and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's worsening mental status may be secondary to an infectious process, hypoxia, or stroke. Further evaluation is needed, including head CT, sputum, blood, and urine cultures, and close monitoring of electrolytes.

2. C. diff Infection: The patient has a chronic C. diff infection leading to severe malnutrition. Treatment involves continuing PO Vanc and stopping PPI. A GI consult may be considered for further options.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to infection or fluid overload, possibly exacerbated by CHF. Sputum culture should be followed, and ABG should continue to be monitored. Diuresis with Lasix 40 IV should be continued to manage fluid overload.

4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, obesity, and a history of breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/117 to 142/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is on invasive ventilation support and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's physical examination reveals pitting edema in the lower extremities and clear lung sounds on auscultation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, BUN, creatinine, lactic acid, and LDH, while other lab values such as hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium are within normal range.

Radiology findings indicate a small extraaxial hyperdensity anterior to the left pons, which may represent a small meningioma and is unchanged from a previous study.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to an infectious process, hypoxia, or stroke. Further evaluation is needed, including a head CT, sputum, blood,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in the ICU on invasive ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's worsening mental status is likely secondary to an infectious process, possibly leading to delirium or encephalopathy.
2. C. diff Infection: The patient has a chronic C. diff infection, which can lead to severe malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to infection or fluid overload, particularly given her underlying CHF.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and there is a goal to achieve negative fluid balance today.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated and have been fluctuating over time, indicating acute kidney injury on top of chronic renal failure.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was previously in atrial fibrillation but was converted back to sinus rhythm. She requires rate control and anticoagulation.
7. Breast Cancer: The patient has a history of breast cancer, and her medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and midline access. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 131/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -135 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications, including furosemide, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 226 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, and low albumin levels at 2.4 g/dL. Imaging shows a small extraaxial hyperdensity anterior to the left pons, which may represent a small meningioma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely secondary to an infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause, which could be due to hypoxia, stroke, or infection. Imaging studies"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 per family, pt has been more irritable and
   lethargic.  With nursing, she is alert and oriented x [**1-26**].  With
   physicians, she is minimally interactive.  DDX includes infection vs.
   hypoxia vs. new CVA vs. electrolyte abnormalities.  Most likely source
   is infectious process, given the + U/A and urine cx growing GNRs from
   [**2117-6-26**].
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - sputum cx contaminant and blood cx pending
   - follow electrolytes (urea seems stable)
   - pt started on ceftriaxone [**1-25**] 600 WBC
s on UA
 then held until cx
   and sensitivity back.  Will re-start rocephin today and cont PO
   vancomycin for potential C diff.
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes
 pt c/o chest tightness, EKG done and
   unchanged from prior.  Cardiac enzymes drawn and troponin bump to 0.6.
   Concern for ACS.
   - pt started on asa, heparin gtt
   - coumadin held
   - not started on BB due to her periods of bradycardia
   # Leukocytosis
 likely stress response vs. infectious response (WBC up
   to 12.7 from 9.4).  Can be consistent with her urinary tract infection
   noted above.
   - will tx with rocephin pending urine cx results
   # hx of C.diff Infection
 leading to severe malnutrition
   - C diff toxin assay pending
   - records from [**Hospital1 723**] show that pt has been C diff pos in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then
   [**2117-5-28**]
   - consider GI consult for further options if she is pos here
   - She may need to be on long term suppressive C diff therapy.  Will
   consult ID.
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach on vent setting CMV 450 x
   15, 12 PEEP and 50% FIO2 with oxygenation that is somewhat poor.  PEEP
   was increased overnight.
   - DDX includes infection vs. fluid overload [**1-25**] CHF.  Also has
   underlying OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulm htn, and RV
   failure causing LV failure.
   - sputum culture contaminant specimen
   - consider CT to evaluate for lung process
   - diuresis
 will start lasix gtt with zaroxlyn for a goal diuresis of
   2L.  She was +500 ml overnight.  She may require CVVH as she is
   apparently 100 lbs over her dry weight; will discuss with renal.
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - diuresis
 Goal negative 2L today, had minimal response to lasix gtt
   overnight.
   - can discuss role of sildenafil and afterloading the RV, but this may
   cause her LV to decompensate.
   - have added zaroxlyn.
   - rate control PRN
   - consider restarting statin (and also for potential ACS).
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - Cr was 1.9 on admit
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # A.fib
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus.
   - Continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-26**]
 will increase from 2 to 4 mg
   - rate control as needed (HR currently 70
   # H/o Breast Cancer
   - Continue arimidex.
   # DM2
   - Will start ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - will consult wound care

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. diff infection, and acute on chronic renal failure. She presents with worsening mental status, failure to improve, and a history of irritability and lethargy. The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, and a history of C. diff infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, GERD, and decubitus ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and is currently showing signs of possible infection, such as leukocytosis and urinary tract infection. It is important to monitor for any worsening infection and treat accordingly.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes and a history of atrial fibrillation. There are concerns about acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary, and appropriate interventions should be considered.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. It is crucial to optimize oxygenation and ventilation settings to ensure adequate gas exchange. Frequent monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjusting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic C. diff infection, and a history of breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications such as altered mental status, C. diff infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely secondary to an infectious process, hypoxia, or stroke. Further investigation is needed, including head CT, sputum, blood, and urine cultures, and follow-up on electrolytes.
2. C. diff Infection: The patient has a severe C. diff infection leading to malnutrition. Treatment includes continuing PO Vanc and stopping PPI, checking a C. diff titer, obtaining records from previous hospitalizations, and considering a GI consult for further options.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to infection or fluid overload. Follow-up sputum culture, ABG, and consideration for CT to evaluate for lung process are recommended.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure with minimal response to IV las"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of heart disease and was treated for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ASA, heparin, and coumadin. She also has impaired skin integrity and chronic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and was treated with Flagyl and Vanc. She has allergies to Flagyl and a rash occurred as a result. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/82 mmHg to 126/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate a normal creatinine level, while liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Imaging studies show no significant abnormalities. The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing care and management of her conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium infusion, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/47 to 153/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,628 mL with outputs totaling 1,890 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%.

Potential medical complications:
1. Heart disease: The patient's history of heart disease puts them at risk for complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, or unstable angina.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 most likely etiology is infection
   - urine cx growing GNR
s; blood cx pending and sputum cx rejected [**1-25**]
   contamination with oropharyngeal secretions
   - consider repeating sputum cultures
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt was re-started on ceftriaxone yesterday
 will continue
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes
 pt c/o chest tightness, EKG done and
   unchanged from prior.  Cardiac enzymes drawn and troponin bump to 0.6.
   Concern for ACS.
   - troponin bumped to 0.7 yesterday; however, CPK trending down
   - pt started on ASA and heparin gtt
 goal PTT is 50-80
 PTT now 78.3
   - pt also on a statin
   - not started on BB due to her periods of bradycardia
   # Leukocytosis
 likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - pt on ceftriaxone for urine cx with GNR
   - WBC down to 12.0 from 12.7
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
 leading to severe malnutrition
   - C diff toxin assay pending
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - consider GI consult for further options if she is pos here
   - also, consider ID consult
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach on vent setting CMV 450 x
   15, 12 PEEP and 50% FIO2
   - PEEP had been increased 2 days ago; SaO2 98%
   - consider repeat ABG
   - DDX includes infection vs. fluid overload [**1-25**] CHF.  Also has
   underlying OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulm htn, and RV
   failure causing LV failure.
   - sputum culture contaminant specimen
 consider repeating
   - consider CT to evaluate for lung process
   - diuretics were d/c
ed yesterday [**1-25**] to pt no UOP
 consider CVVH as
   pt is supposedly very fluid overloaded
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - consider CVVH
   - can discuss role of sildenafil and afterloading the RV, but this may
   cause her LV to decompensate.
   - rate control PRN
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - Cr was 1.9 on admit
 now at 2.0
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - UOP was 890mL yesterday
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # A.fib
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus.
   - Continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-26**]
 will increase from 2 to 4 mg
   - rate control as needed (HR currently 70
   # H/o Breast Cancer
   - Continue arimidex.
   # DM2
   - Will start ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - will consult wound care
   - will continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient's current issues include altered mental status likely due to infection, elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, history of C.diff infection, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other medications for her conditions. She is also receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube and has a midline catheter for IV access.

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a likely infection causing her altered mental status. Urine culture results indicate the presence of a gram-negative rod (GNR), and blood cultures are pending. Sputum culture was initially rejected due to contamination, but may need to be repeated.
2. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, which may suggest acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, CPK levels are trending down, indicating a lower likelihood of ACS. Troponin levels are elevated, but the patient is being treated with aspirin and heparin. The goal PTT is 50-80, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 most likely etiology is infection
   - urine cx growing GNR
s; blood cx pending and sputum cx rejected [**1-25**]
   contamination with oropharyngeal secretions
   - consider repeating sputum cultures
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt was re-started on ceftriaxone yesterday
 will continue
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes
 pt c/o chest tightness, EKG done and
   unchanged from prior.  Cardiac enzymes drawn and troponin bump to 0.6.
   Concern for ACS.
   - troponin bumped to 0.7 yesterday; however, CPK trending down
   - pt started on ASA and heparin gtt
 goal PTT is 50-80
 PTT now 78.3
   - pt also on a statin
   - not started on BB due to her periods of bradycardia
   # Leukocytosis
 likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - pt on ceftriaxone for urine cx with GNR
   - WBC down to 12.0 from 12.7
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
 leading to severe malnutrition
   - C diff toxin assay pending
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - consider GI consult for further options if she is pos here
   - also, consider ID consult
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach on vent setting CMV 450 x
   15, 12 PEEP and 50% FIO2
   - PEEP had been increased 2 days ago; SaO2 98%
   - consider repeat ABG
   - DDX includes infection vs. fluid overload [**1-25**] CHF.  Also has
   underlying OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulm htn, and RV
   failure causing LV failure.
   - sputum culture contaminant specimen
 consider repeating
   - consider CT to evaluate for lung process
   - diuretics were d/c
ed yesterday [**1-25**] to pt no UOP
 consider CVVH as
   pt is supposedly very fluid overloaded
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - consider CVVH
   - can discuss role of sildenafil and afterloading the RV, but this may
   cause her LV to decompensate.
   - rate control PRN
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - Cr was 1.9 on admit
 now at 2.0
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - UOP was 890mL yesterday
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # A.fib
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus; looks to be in Afib
   now
   - Coumadin was stopped and heparin gtt started because of potential for
   ACS
 continue heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - will discuss when we can restart warfarin
   - rate control as needed (HR currently 80
s-90
   # H/o Breast Cancer
   - Continue arimidex.
   # DM2
   - on ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - wound care consulted; will f/u recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy placed. She has a history of chest tightness, elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, C. difficile infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a urine culture growing a gram-negative rod (GNR), and blood and sputum cultures are pending. She may have an infection causing her altered mental status.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient complains of chest tightness, and her troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible ACS.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to a stress response or an infectious response.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection leading to severe malnutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents from LTAC with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has altered mental status likely due to infection, as indicated by blood cultures pending and previous sputum culture growing out pseudomonas and GNR. She also has elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, a history of C. diff infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. She is currently on several medications including heparin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and others. The patient is also on a statin but not on a beta-blocker due to periods of bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has altered mental status likely due to an infection, as indicated by blood cultures pending and previous sputum culture growing out pseudomonas and GNR. There is a need to readdress antibiotic coverage with new microbiological data.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. She has a history of OSA and CHF, which may contribute to her respiratory failure. There is a concern for lung processes, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, chronic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing issues:

1. Altered Mental Status: The most likely cause of the altered mental status is infection, as indicated by the growing pseudomonas and GNR in sputum and urine cultures. Blood cultures are pending.

2. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: The patient complained of chest tightness, and an EKG was performed, showing unchanged results from prior. Troponin levels have increased, but CPK is trending down. Heparin was stopped due to concerns about bleeding, and anticoagulation will be restarted after dialysis.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly due to a stress response or an infectious response. She is currently on ceftriaxone for the GNR infection in her urine and sputum.

4. History of C. diff Infection: The patient had a previous C. diff infection in the past and is currently negative for it here. However, there is consideration for a GI consult if she tests positive again.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a trache"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, respiratory failure, chronic C. diff infection, and a history of breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has been on various treatments and medications, including ceftriaxone for suspected infections, statin for elevated cardiac enzymes, and heparin for anticoagulation. However, she developed a rash and an allergic reaction to Flagyl (metronidazole), so it was discontinued.

The patient's vital signs show a low body temperature, stable blood pressure, and a slightly elevated heart rate. Her respiratory rate is within normal range, and her oxygen saturation is good at 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, and altered liver function tests. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output.

Assessment and plan include several diagnoses such as chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status (likely due to infection), acute renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, and a history of C. difficile infection. The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, a history of breast cancer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, obesity, respiratory failure, chronic kidney disease, and a history of C. difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, a history of C. difficile infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of infection with growing out pseudomonas and GNR in sputum and urine cultures. She is currently on ceftriaxone but sensitivity data is pending. Additionally, she has a history of chronic C. difficile infection.
2. Cardiac Enzymes: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. This could be due to ischemic heart disease or other cardiac conditions.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, and her respiratory failure is complicated by pseudomonas infection in the sputum culture.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with creatinine levels at 1"

1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including pneumonia (Pseudomonas and Klebsiella), leukocytosis, and a history of C. difficile infection. These infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, which can worsen her overall kidney function and may require dialysis.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure/volume overload, which can lead to further cardiac complications"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. diff infection, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided. These include:

1. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 34.1°C (93.3°F), which is below the normal range. Hypothermia can occur due to various reasons, such as decreased heat production, impaired thermoregulation, or exposure to cold environments.

2. Anemia, chronic: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.2 g/dL, indicating chronic anemia. Anemia can be caused by chronic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, or blood loss.

3. Obesity: The patient is described as obese, which increases the risk of several medical conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, joint problems, and certain cancers.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is arousable to verbal stimuli but may not always provide appropriate responses. This altered mental status could be due to various causes, including infection, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions.

5. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated (1.7-1.8 mg/dL), indicating impaired kidney function. Acute renal failure can be caused by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presents to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve from her previous treatment. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. Her vital signs show hypothermia, and she has a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, chronic anemia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple cultures pending, including blood, sputum, and urine. The sputum culture has grown pseudomonas, and the urine culture is growing Citrobacter kosher and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This indicates a potential bacterial infection that needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as indicated by her elevated creatinine levels and poor urine output. Close monitoring of her renal function is necessary, and dialysis may be required to manage her renal failure.

3. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection. Since her current C. diff status is negative, further management of her C. difficile history needs to be determined by the ID team.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place. Her respiratory status needs close monitoring"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. 

The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and other ICU medications. The patient has allergies to Flagyl (oral) and rash, and the last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin on 07/01/2117 at 01:00 PM and 08:57 PM, respectively.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.1°C (95.1°F) at maximum and 34.1°C (93.3°F) currently
- Heart rate: 66 bpm (64-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 104/48 mmHg (68-131/37-84 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (15-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on the tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 15, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 5.3-8.4 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 23.2-24.7%
- Platelet count: 227-238 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.5-1.7 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 114-147 mg/dL
- Sodium: 139-147 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.7-4.2 mEq/L
- Chloride: 24.7% (normal range not provided)
- BUN: 7.2-8.4 g/dL
- Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, faint heart sounds, clear lung auscultation, and limited examination due to positioning. The patient's general condition is described as alert and nodding to questions, sometimes mouthing words as well.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypothermia, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, other heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and a history of C. difficile infection. The patient's altered mental status is improving, most likely due to an infectious etiology. The patient has leukocytosis, a history of C. difficile"

   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 improving, most likely etiology is infection
   - blood cx NGTD
   - sputum cx was done
 growing out pseudomonas, GNRs, GPRs
   - urine cx growing out citrobacter koseri and klebsiella pneumo
   repeat urine cx pending
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt switched to cipro yesterday because it has better urine
   penetration
 will continue cipro for a 5 day course (day 1 = [**2117-7-1**])
   # Leukocytosis
likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - resolving
   - pt on cipro for urine cx with GNR
s - WBC down to 8.4
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]

   observe for recurrence of c.diff
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   50% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - sputum culture growing pseudomonas, and Pt has h/o pseudomonas in
   sputum.  No evidence of current PNA
   - pt was on diuretics but had no response in UOP; pt is on CVVH with a
   goal of maximum diuresis (has been -12L in 2 days)
   - However, it appears that we are affecting hemodynamics enough to slow
   down on cvvh, as her maps have been in the high 40s.  Will also check
   lactate.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - creatinine is now 1.4
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # Anemia
   - Hct trending down and currently 23

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of chronic anemia, obesity, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin), IV iron, calcium gluconate, KCl, and other medications. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 6,058 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, and oxygen delivery device set at 60% FiO2. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment and plan include hypothermia, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and may require specific treatment such as oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure,"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 improving, most likely etiology is infection
   - blood cx NGTD
   - sputum cx was done
 growing out pseudomonas, GNRs, GPRs
   - urine cx growing out citrobacter koseri and klebsiella pneumo
   repeat urine cx pending
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt switched to cipro yesterday because it has better urine
   penetration
 will continue cipro for a 5 day course (day 1 = [**2117-7-1**])
   # Leukocytosis
likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - resolving
   - pt on cipro for urine cx with GNR
s - WBC down to 8.4
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro, then stop and
   observe for recurrence of c.diff
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   50% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - sputum culture growing pseudomonas, and Pt has h/o pseudomonas in
   sputum.  No evidence of current PNA
   - pt was on diuretics but had no response in UOP; pt is on CVVH with a
   goal of maximum diuresis (has been -12L in 2 days)
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - creatinine is now 1.4
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # Anemia
   - Hct trending down and currently 23
   - guiac stools and can transfuse [**12-25**] U pRBC during CVVH session
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus; in Afib this am
   - INR trending up.  Given vitamin K and will check LFT
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production
   - rate control PRN
   # DM2
   - on ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been diagnosed with hypothermia, anemia, renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and a recent C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. difficile infection and is currently on antibiotics. She has also been growing different types of bacteria in her urine, sputum, and blood cultures. There is a risk of developing a new infection or resistance to the current antibiotic treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and her creatinine levels are improving with fluid removal through CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). It is important to continue monitoring her BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, and urine output.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is oxygenating and ventilating well. However, she has a history of pseudomonas infection in her sputum, so there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient has diastolic heart failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. difficile infection, respiratory failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient's current temperature is 35.6°C, which is below the normal range (36.5-37.5°C). Hypothermia can occur due to various reasons such as sepsis, medication effects, or inadequate heating in the ICU.
2. ANEMIA, CHRONIC: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL. Chronic anemia may be present due to underlying chronic conditions or ongoing blood loss.
3. OBESITY (INCLUDING OVERWEIGHT, MORBID OBESITY): The patient's weight is 135.3 kg, indicating obesity. Obesity can increase the risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and musculoskeletal issues.
4. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be caused by infection, medication effects, or other underlying medical conditions.
5. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to factors such as dehydration, medication toxicity, or sepsis.
6. HEART DISEASE, OTHER: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, which can lead to other cardiac complications.
7. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcers, indicating impaired skin integrity. This can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: The patient requires a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, suggesting chronic respiratory failure.
9. C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE): The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis.
10. DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which increases the risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease and neuropathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, obesity, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and previous C. difficile infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the recommendation for IV iron therapy. This could potentially lead to further deterioration of kidney function or the need for renal replacement therapy.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is consistently low, with readings ranging from 35.5 to 35.6 degrees Celsius. This may indicate an underlying issue with thermoregulation or inadequate warming measures in the ICU.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin. There is a risk of recurrence or development of other infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with assistance from a tracheostomy tube. The ventilator settings indicate a need for assistance with breathing, and the RSBI deferred suggests ongoing respiratory support may be required.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia requires ongoing management, and the low hemoglobin level indicates a need for further investigation and treatment.
6. Heart disease: The patient's history of heart disease, along with the"

   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 improving, most likely etiology is infection
   - blood cx NGTD
   - sputum cx was done
 growing out pseudomonas, GNRs, GPRs but no
   evidence of pneumonia, may represent colonization
   - urine cx from [**6-26**] grew out citrobacter koseri and klebsiella pneumo.
   Urine cx from [**7-1**] grew yeast only
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt switched to cipro yesterday because it has better urine
   penetration
 will continue cipro for a 5 day course (day 1 = [**2117-7-1**])
   # Leukocytosis
likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - pt on cipro for urine cx with GNR
s - WBC 11.8
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro, then stop and
   observe for recurrence of c.diff. If recurrence see ID note from
   [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   50% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - sputum culture growing pseudomonas, and Pt has h/o pseudomonas in
   sputum.  No evidence of current PNA
   - pt was on diuretics but had no response in UOP; pt is on CVVH with a
   goal of maximum diuresis (has been -12L in 2 days)
   - However, it appears that we are affecting hemodynamics enough to slow
   down on cvvh, as her maps have been in the high 40s.  Will also check
   lactate.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - creatinine is now 1.2
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # Anemia
   - Hct trending down and currently 22.5
   - guiac stools and can transfuse [**12-25**] U pRBC during CVVH session for Hct
   <21
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus;
   - Cont. trend INR. Given vitamin K and will check LFT
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production
   - rate control PRN
   # DM2
   - on ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a long-term acute care hospital. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, and her blood culture grew pseudomonas. She also has leukocytosis, a history of C. diff infection, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, diastolic heart failure with volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation with coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of C. diff infection and her blood culture grew pseudomonas. There is a possibility of developing further infections due to her weakened immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires invasive ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has chronic heart failure and diastolic heart failure with volume overload. These conditions increase the risk of cardiac events such as"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. diff infection, and respiratory failure. She was admitted from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current conditions include hypothermia, anemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. She also has a history of C. diff infection and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her blood cultures from July 4th grew out pseudomonas, GNRs, and GPRs, but no evidence of pneumonia. Urine cultures from June 26th grew out Citrobacter koseri and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a yeast-only culture from July 1st. A head CT showed no acute intracranial process.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.2 mg/d"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current condition includes hypothermia, anemia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O. Her blood pressure is currently stable, but she has a history of hypotension and required vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating a potential ongoing infection. She has positive cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter kosher in her urine, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in her sputum. However, there is no evidence of pneumonia. She also has an elevated blood glucose level and altered liver function tests.

The patient's past medical history includes chronic C. difficile infection, with previous positive tests in [month] 1996 and [date] 2017. She has been treated with oral vancomycin and is currently on intravenous ciprofloxacin for her urinary tract infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and currently shows signs of leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infectious response. Blood cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CMV mode, set at 450 mL tidal volume with 12 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Sputum cultures have grown pseudomonas, but no evidence of pneumonia is observed. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored.

3. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient shows no response to diuretics and is experiencing diastolic heart failure with volume overload. She is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove excess fluid.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving with fluid removal through CVVH. Her baseline creatinine levels are 1.1-1.3,"

   penetration
 will continue cipro for a 5 day course (day 1 = [**2117-7-1**])
   - Check blood Cx and mycolitic cx
   # Leukocytosis
likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - pt on cipro for urine cx with GNR

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. difficile infection and currently has positive cultures for pseudomonas, GNRs, and yeast in the urine. She also has leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection or a stress response. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but monitoring for recurrent C. difficile infection is important.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and is oxygenating and ventilating well. However, she has a sputum culture growing pseudomonas, which may represent colonization rather than pneumonia. Close monitoring is required.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Fluid removal through CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being used to manage volume overload and improve renal function.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient shows no response to diuretics or other medications, so CVVH is being utilized to remove excess fluid.
5. Anemia: The patient's hem"

   # Altered Mental Status
 improving, most likely etiology is infection
   - GPC in blood
-> will restart Vancomycin, PO Vanc should be continued
   x2 weeks
   - sputum cx was done
 growing out pseudomonas, GNRs, GPRs but no
   evidence of pneumonia, may represent colonization
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered.
   However pt on a 5 day course of Cipro for previous urine culture
   growing citrobacter and klebsiella. Last day of Cipro today
   - surveliance culture results pending
   -
   # Hypotension- Holding steady, but per renal will hold CVVH today. Will
   rediscuss with renal later today
   # Possible sepsis
   - White count increasing despite treating of UTI and starting
   Vancomycin. However, no bands in diff. and lactic acid on 0.9
   - Will monitor WBC

 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - last ABG showed improvement in PH and PCO2.
   - Will discuss CVVH with Renal. Pt is still volume overloaded and would

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing several issues including altered mental status, hypotension, possible sepsis, a history of C. diff infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and is currently showing signs of possible sepsis with an increasing white blood cell count. There is also a concern about colonization with Pseudomonas in her sputum culture.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and is oxygenating and ventilating well. However, there may be a need to wean her off the ventilator once diuresis goals are reached.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient has diastolic heart failure with volume overload that has not responded to lasix or Zaroxolyn. She is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove excess fluid.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which seems to be improving with fluid removal through CVVH. Close monitoring of BUN, creatinine, and urine output is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. She has received transfusions to improve her hemoglobin level.
6. Atrial Fibrillation/Coagulopathy: The patient has atrial fibrillation and a supratherapeutic INR due to poor absorption and production. Anticoagulation may be considered once stable.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being managed with insulin sliding scale.
8. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease and is not on proton pump inhibitors due to potential interference with oral vancomycin.
9. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with decubitus ulcers, for which wound care recommendations are being followed.

Overall, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presents with worsening mental status, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and current cultures growing out various organisms such as Pseudomonas, GNRs, and yeast. There is a need to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function through labs (creatinine, BUN) and urine output is essential.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive but is now resolving. It is important to monitor blood pressure and adjust medication dosages or hold sedatives if necessary to prevent further hypotension.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to a stress response or an infectious response. Regular monitoring of white blood cell count is advised.

5. Diastolic heart failure/volume overload: The patient has diastolic heart failure with volume overload. This requires management through diuretics and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) to remove excess fluid.

6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending down, indicating the need for transfusion during CVVH sessions when Hct falls below 21%.

7. Atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy: The patient was in atrial fibrillation but has been converted to sinus rhythm. Monitoring of INR is necessary, and consideration should be given to anticoagulation once stable.

8. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has diabetes and is on insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS).

9. GERD: The patient is off PPI due to potential interference with PO vanc.

10. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has decubitus ulcers, and wound care consultation has been obtained.

It is important to note that this is a summary of potential medical complications based on the provided information. The actual medical complications and their management may vary depending on the patient's condition and the healthcare team's assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently sedated with persistent asterixis. He is bradycardic with associated hypoxia on leuophen, which was changed to dopamine. The patient has high CVVH pressures that may clot off, and there is persistent funguria, leading to the ordering of a Foley change. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit for HCT of 20 and was started on vancomycin. The patient's allergies include Flagyl (Metronidazole) with a rash. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 07/05/2117 at 04:38 PM and ciprofloxacin on 07/05/2117 at 08:00 PM. The patient is currently on dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and persistent funguria, indicating a risk for further infections.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has"

   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 Stopped seroquel and sedation yesterday.
   Mental status improving
   - GPC in blood
-> will restart Vancomycin. If Coag negative will try
   to treat through with Vancomycin
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered.
   However pt on a 5 day course of Cipro for previous urine culture
   growing citrobacter and klebsiella. Last day of Cipro today
   - surveliance culture results from yesterday pending
   - Will culture from every line today
   # Hypotension- Holding steady. Will start CVVH today since it is
   improving her respiratory status. Will rediscuss with renal later today
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro, then stop and
   observe for recurrence of c.diff. If recurrence see ID note from
   [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - last ABG showed improvement in PH and PCO2.
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
   - creatinine is now 1.0
 improving with fluid removal

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presented to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a previous hospitalization. The patient is currently sedated, tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypotension, anemia, respiratory failure, chronic heart disease, impaired skin integrity, and a recent episode of Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection due to recent antibiotic use.
2. Development of a central line-associated bloodstream infection due to prolonged use of central lines.
3. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobility.
4. Worsening of chronic renal failure or acute kidney injury.
5. Progression of respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Complications related to atrial fibrillation such as stroke or thromboembolism.
7. Development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
8. Poor glycemic control and subsequent development of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
9. Infection at the site of arterial or venous catheters.
10. Continued volume overload and worsening heart failure symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current conditions include hypothermia, anemia, chronic renal failure, diastolic heart failure with volume overload, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, which was confirmed in hospital records from previous admissions.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions, including CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, dopamine infusion, and multiple medications for various conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the respiratory status remains poor. The patient is volume overloaded, and efforts are being made to diurese her. The renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.0.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and current mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's volume overload and ongoing diuresis.

2. C. difficile Infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection and recurrence pose a risk for further episodes of diarrhea and colitis. Proper antibiotic stewardship and surveillance are crucial in preventing another episode.

3. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient's diastolic heart failure and volume overload put her at risk for worsening cardiac function and fluid retention. Aggressive diuresis and fluid management are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function is currently improving, there is still a risk for further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters and continued efforts to remove excess fluid through CVVH are important.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk for pressure ulcers and wound infections. Proper wound care and repositioning are essential in preventing further skin breakdown.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status requires careful monitoring for any changes in cognition or orientation. Delirium assessment tools and regular neurological assessments are recommended.

Overall, this patient presents with multiple complex medical issues requiring close monitoring and coordination of care."

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and respiratory failure. 

Key findings include:
- Hypothermia
- Anemia
- Impaired skin integrity
- Respiratory failure
- C. difficile infection
- Acute renal failure
- Diastolic heart failure/volume overload
- Altered mental status

Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: Seroquel and sedation were stopped, and mental status is improving.
2. Hypotension: Started CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) since it is improving her respiratory status.
3. Hx of C.diff Infection: C.diff negative x 2 here, previous records show C.diff positive in 1996 and 2017-05-28. ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro, then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff.
4. Respiratory Failure: Currently on tracheostomy; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and 60% FiO2. Oxygenating poor, will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis.

   # Altered Mental Status
 Stopped seroquel and sedation 2 days ago.
   Mental status improving
   - GPC in blood
-> restarted Vanco.  Can d/c today given afebrile and
   clinical inprovement
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro stopped yesterday
   - f/u cultures
   # Hypotension- Holding steady. Started CVVH yesterday since it is
   improving her respiratory status.
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenating poor
   - last ABG showed improvement in PH and PCO2.
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
   - creatinine is now 1.0
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has had several recent events including hypothermia, anemia, respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection. She has also had issues with diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and chronic obstructive sleep apnea requiring tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes continued volume overload, worsening respiratory status despite CVVH, and improving renal function. She is being treated with various medications including vancomycin, dopamine, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to recent antibiotic use and poor bowel hygiene.
2. Worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to CVVH and continues to be volume overloaded.
3. Further deterioration in renal function if fluid removal is inadequate or if there is a new insult to the kidneys.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters.
5. Poor glycemic control due to enteral nutrition and underlying diabetes mellitus type 2.
6. Progression of dec"

The patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has a history of C. diff infection and is currently on vancomycin. She also has a tracheostomy, chronic ventilatory support, and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute-on-chronic renal failure. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 108/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, impaired coagulation, and elevated glucose levels. She has ongoing issues with hypothermia, altered mental status, hypotension, chronic C. diff infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's care plan includes ongoing management of these conditions, including ID recommendations for C. diff treatment, weaning off ventilatory support, diuresis for volume overload, renal management, and wound care for"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 Stopped seroquel and sedation 3 days ago.
   Mental status improving
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro done.
   - Pt with known funguria likely colonization.  Given temp spike on CVVH
   this may represent an ascending infection so started Fluconazole (D1
   [**7-8**]) for 3 days
   - f/u cultures
   #  Leukocytosis- concerning for infxn; possible source is yeast UTI
   -Fluconazole as above
   -given abdominal exam, will check LFTs
   # Hypotension- Holding steady.
   -on Dopamine 9mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here, will check another given guiac positive
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenating improved with PEEP
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
   - creatinine is now 1.0
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   -check renal recs
   -renal would have to put in order for more specific pre and post CRRT-
   now pre 200, post 1300 per renal this is accurate
   # Anemia
   - Hct now slow drift down to 21.9, transfuse when <21.0, either today
   or tomorrow.
   - restarted EPO
   - follow in am
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a morbidly obese male with multiple medical complications, including chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). There have been recent temperature spikes, indicating a potential ascending infection involving the kidneys. The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high, requiring adjustment of insulin therapy. Further investigations, such as a renal ultrasound and possible initiation of fluconazole, may be necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ascending kidney infection: The patient's recent temperature spike on CVVH suggests the possibility of an ascending infection involving the kidneys, particularly in the context of known funguria and persistently elevated FSBG (fractional excretion of sodium).
2. Adjustments to insulin therapy: The patient's consistently high blood glucose levels indicate the need for adjustment in insulin therapy to achieve glycemic control.
3. Renal ultrasound: Given the patient's acute renal failure and potential kidney infection, a renal ultrasound may provide valuable information regarding the underlying cause.
4. Initiation of fluconazole: Considering the patient's known funguria and the possibility of a fungal infection, initiation of fluconazole treatment may be necessary to address any fungal infection.
5. Respiratory support: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation, and"

   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached

   Code status:
   Disposition: pending above
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has worsened today compared to yesterday. Repeat urine cultures only grew yeast, and the Foley catheter was changed. A 5-day course of Ciprofloxacin was completed. Given the patient's known funguria and recent temperature spike on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), this may represent an ascending infection involving the kidneys, especially considering the persistently elevated fractional excretion of sodium (FBSG). The insulin regimen needs to be adjusted again, and consideration should be given to renal ultrasound and initiation of fluconazole. Blood for fungal culture should also be obtained, and follow-up cultures should be done.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low. Dopamine at 9 mcg/kg/min is being administered.

3. History of C. difficile infection: The patient had a previous C. difficile infection in 1996 and again on [**2117-5-28**]. ID recommendations include PO vancomycin for 14 days after the last dose of ciprofloxacin (D1=[**7-7**], last day = [**7-20**]), followed by stopping and observing for recurrence of C. difficile. If there is a recurrence, refer to the ID note from [**2117-7-2**].

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated with a tracheostomy tube and on CVVH with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set at 450 mL tidal volume and 15 breaths per minute. PEEP is at 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 is 60%. Oxygenation has improved with PEEP. CVVH will continue, and discussion with the renal team will be held. The patient remains volume overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP will be given due to continued volume overload. Weaning attempts will be made once diuresis goals are reached.

5. Diastolic heart failure/volume overload: The patient has shown no response to lasix or zaroxolyn. CVVH is ongoing with the goal of maximum fluid removal. Continued volume overload is a concern.

6. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved to 1.0 and are resolving. BUN, Cr, and UOP should continue to be monitored. Renal recommendations should be reviewed, and a renal ultrasound may be considered. Pre and post CRRT measurements should be obtained, with"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, but she still has some altered mental status. Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, Foley changed ordered. She has been started on a 5-day course of Cipro. It is likely colonization, and given the temperature spike on CVVH, this may represent an ascending infection. She has been started on Fluconazole for 3 days.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is concerning for infection. The possible source is a yeast urinary tract infection (UTI), but the WBC count is still rising. Fluconazole has been started as above.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is holding steady. She is on dopamine 10mcg/kg/min and will be weaned for a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.

4. History of C. diff infection: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, which was negative twice here. She will be checked again, and if positive, she will receive oral vancomycin for 14 days after the last dose of ciprof"

   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 improving
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro done.
   - Pt with known funguria likely colonization.  Given temp spike on CVVH
   this may represent an ascending infection so started Fluconazole (D1
   [**7-8**]) for 3 days
   - f/u cultures today
   #  Leukocytosis- concerning for infxn especially with T of 99.3 while
   on CVVH today; possible source is yeast UTI however WBC still rising
    -Fluconazole as above
   -given abdominal exam, checked LFTs but were normal and abdominal exam
   has improved today
   -? If cdiff, sending today; if +, talk with ID about maybe adding
   Flagyll
   -f/u diff to be sure not drug reaction
   -continue to check Blood ctxs daily or every other day
   # Hypotension- Holding steady.
    -on Dopamine 10mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60 after transfusion
   and CVVH today
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here, will check another
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenating improved with PEEP; wean Fi02 today as best response
   seems to have been with PEEP increase
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
    - creatinine is now 0.9
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   -check renal recs
   # Anemia
    - Hct now slow drift to <21; transfuse 1U this am, recheck Hct this pm
   - restarted EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
    - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
    - insulin drip started [**7-8**] because continuously >200; increased [**7-9**]
   because still high
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc, started H2B
   # Decubitus Ulcers
    - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypotension, history of C. diff infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, AFib/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and a temperature of 99.3, which may indicate an ongoing infection. She also has a history of C. diff infection and is currently being treated with fluconazole for possible yeast infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and is receiving 450 mL of tidal volume at 15 breaths per minute with 60% FiO2. There is ongoing concern for respiratory failure, and adjustments to the ventilator settings are being made to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring tracheostomy, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient presents from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been improving. The repeat urine cultures only grew yeast, so the Foley catheter was changed. A 5-day course of ciprofloxacin was completed. Given the patient's known funguria likely colonization, and a temporary spike in continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), it may represent an ascending infection. Therefore, fluconazole was started for 3 days, and follow-up cultures were ordered.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is still rising, which is concerning for infection. Although the source is suspected to be a yeast urinary tract infection (UTI), other potential sources should be investigated. Fluconazole was started as above, and the patient's abdominal exam was checked, with normal liver function tests (LFTs). It is also worth considering adding Flagyl if the patient has guaiac-positive stool and c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with worsening mental status and respiratory failure from the long-term acute care hospital (LTAC). The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), acute renal failure, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and a recent yeast urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheo-innominate fistula: The patient had a significant amount of bleeding during a bronchoscopy, and there is concern for a tracheo-innominate fistula. This is a rare but serious complication that can occur after tracheostomy placement.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite being on dopamine. She requires further evaluation and management to improve her blood pressure.
3. Right arm infiltration: The patient has developed infiltration in her right arm, which may require consultation with plastics for further evaluation and treatment.
4. Chronic Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has a history of C. diff infection, and it has recurred in the past. Appropriate treatment and precautions need to be taken to prevent further recurrence.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 poor versus yesterday likely due to activity
   last night, Propofol and versed.
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro done.
   - Pt with known funguria likely colonization.  Given temp spike on CVVH
   this may represent an ascending infection so started Fluconazole (D1
   [**7-8**]) for 3 days, last day today
   - f/u cultures today
   - f/u CT scans for occult infectious source
   #  Leukocytosis- concerning for infxn especially with T of 99.3 while
   on CVVH today; possible source is yeast UTI however WBC still rising
   -Fluconazole as above
   -given abdominal exam, checked LFTs but were normal and abdominal exam
   has improved
   -? If cdiff, still pending; if +, talk with ID about maybe adding
   Flagyll
   -continue to check Blood ctxs daily or every other day
   # Hypotension-
    -on Dopamine 12 (from 10)mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60 after
   transfusion and CVVH today
   -unfortunately little progress in CVVH
   # right arm infiltration- no apparent increased
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here, will check another
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenation not as well today; had improved with PEEP
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
    - creatinine is now stable at 1.0
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   -check renal recs
   # Anemia
   -cont to check Hct, transfuse if <21
   - restarted EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   -spoke with thoracics who said CT adequate and no involvement of
   inominate artery
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
    - insulin drip started [**7-8**] because continuously >200; increased [**7-9**]
   because still high
   # GERD
    - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc, started H2B
   # Decubitus Ulcers
     - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of C. difficile infection. The patient presents with altered mental status and failure to improve from a previous LTAC stay. 

The patient has been experiencing several complications, including hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), altered mental status, chronic anemia, respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection. The patient also has leukocytosis and a temperature of 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit while on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), suggesting a possible infection. The patient is currently being treated with fluconazole for a yeast urinary tract infection.

The patient's hypotension is being managed with dopamine at 12 mcg/kg/min, and efforts are being made to wean the dose to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. The patient is also undergoing CVVH, but with little progress. 

There is a concern for tracheo-innominate artery fistula, and the patient has lost approximately 150cc of blood from inside the trachea with suction during the procedure. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy multiple times, and no active bleeding was found. 

The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection and is being advised to receive a 14-day course of oral vancomycin after the last dose of ciprofloxacin.

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 poor versus yesterday likely due to activity
   last night, Propofol and versed.
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro done.
   - Pt with known funguria likely colonization.  Given temp spike on CVVH
   this may represent an ascending infection so started Fluconazole (D1
   [**7-8**]) for 3 days, last day today
   - f/u cultures today
   - f/u CT scans for occult infectious source
   #  Leukocytosis- concerning for infxn especially with T of 99.3 while
   on CVVH today; possible source is yeast UTI however WBC still rising
   -Fluconazole as above
   -given abdominal exam, checked LFTs but were normal and abdominal exam
   has improved
   -? If cdiff, still pending; if +, talk with ID about maybe adding
   Flagyll
   -continue to check Blood ctxs daily or every other day
   # Hypotension-
    -on Dopamine 12 (from 10)mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60 after
   transfusion and CVVH today
   -unfortunately little progress in CVVH
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here, will check another
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenation not as well today; had improved with PEEP
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
    - creatinine is now stable at 1.0
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   -check renal recs
   # Anemia
   -recheck Hct this am, tranfsue if <21
   - restarted EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   -may choose to get CTA again to be sure of bleeding site
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
    - insulin drip started [**7-8**] because continuously >200; increased [**7-9**]
   because still high
   # GERD
    - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc, started H2B
   # Decubitus Ulcers
     - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic C. diff infection. She presents from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, which are summarized below:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been progressively deteriorating, likely due to various factors such as medication (e.g., Propofol and versed), infections, or underlying chronic conditions.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. The source of infection is suspected to be a yeast urinary tract infection (UTI), for which she has been started on fluconazole.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, despite being on dopamine. Efforts are being made to optimize her condition and achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.

4. History of C.diff Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has been negative twice at the current facility. However, her previous hospital records from [**Month (only) 1996**] and [**2117-5-28**] indicate a positive C. diff infection. ID"

   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 poor versus yesterday likely due to activity
   last night, Propofol and versed.
   - Repeat urine cultures only growing yeast, foley changed ordered. 5
   day course Cipro done.
   - Pt with known funguria likely colonization.  Given temp spike on CVVH
   this may represent an ascending infection so started Fluconazole (D1
   [**7-8**]) for 3 days, last day today
   - f/u cultures today
   - f/u CT scans for occult infectious source
   #  Leukocytosis- concerning for infxn especially with T of 99.3 while
   on CVVH today; possible source is yeast UTI however WBC still rising
   -Fluconazole as above
   -given abdominal exam, checked LFTs but were normal and abdominal exam
   has improved
   -? If cdiff, still pending; if +, talk with ID about maybe adding
   Flagyll
   -continue to check Blood ctxs daily or every other day
   # Hypotension-
    -on Dopamine 12 (from 10)mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60 after
   transfusion and CVVH today
   -unfortunately little progress in CVVH
   # right arm infiltration- no apparent increased
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here, will check another
   - [**Hospital1 723**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1996**] and then [**2117-5-28**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 15 PEEP and
   60% FIO2
   - oxygenation not as well today; had improved with PEEP
   - Will continue CVVH and discuss with Renal. Pt is still volume
   overloaded and would likely improve with more diuresis. Cont PEEP given
   continued volume overload.
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
  Seems resolved
    - creatinine is now stable at 1.0
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   -check renal recs
   # Anemia
   -cont to check Hct, transfuse if <21
   - restarted EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   -spoke with thoracics who said CT adequate and no involvement of
   inominate artery
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
    - insulin drip started [**7-8**] because continuously >200; increased [**7-9**]
   because still high
   # GERD
    - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc, started H2B
   # Decubitus Ulcers
     - wound care consulted; following recommendations

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a history of Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypotension, right arm infiltration, and respiratory failure. She also has a history of C. diff infection, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheo-innominate fistula: The patient underwent multiple bronchoscopies, and during one of them, there was bleeding from the tracheostomy site, leading to a concern for tracheo-innominate fistula. Imaging and consultation with thoracic surgery have been ordered to investigate this further.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, and there is a concern for recurrence. Current treatment includes vancomycin, and additional measures may be necessary if the infection persists.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. Oxygenation has been"

The patient is a 76-year-old female with pulmonary hypertension, who was admitted with anasarca (generalized swelling) and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has undergone several bronchoscopies due to bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The source of bleeding has not been identified. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), potential Clostridium difficile infection, hypotension, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. She is receiving various treatments including broad-spectrum antibiotics, dopamine infusion for blood pressure support, insulin for glycemic control, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator-dependent and there is a need to continue weaning FiO2 as feasible.
2. Leukocytosis/CDiff: The patient's leukocyte count is increasing along with low-grade fevers, suggesting a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but cultures are pending. There is concern for septic physiology, so it is important to closely monitor the patient's condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient is on dopamine infusion to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) while undergoing CVVH. Close monitoring and adjustment of the infusion rate will be necessary.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is on insulin gtt"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA requiring tracheostomy, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), antifungal medication for suspected fungal infection, and insulin for diabetes management. She has also received blood transfusions and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for renal failure.

The patient's current issues include leukocytosis, hypotension, right arm infiltration, history of C. diff infection, respiratory failure, renal failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, anemia, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and decubitus ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and antifungals, indicating ongoing concerns about infections. The blood culture has shown no growth to date.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and is not expected to tolerate weaning at this point.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH, but there is little optimism that fluid removal will be successful due to the patient's blood pressure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with hypothermia, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an infection or inflammation in the body. This may contribute to her poor mental status.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to sepsis or other factors. Dopamine is being used to increase blood pressure, and the goal MAP (mean arterial pressure) is 60.
3. Right arm infiltration: The patient has a history of right arm infiltration, but there is no apparent edema or increased pain. If the condition worsens, consultation with plastics may be necessary.
4. C.diff Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which has been negative on three occasions. The ID recommendations include taking PO vancomycin for 14 days after the last dose of ciprofloxacin (D1=[**7-7**], last day = [**7-20**]), then stopping and observing for recurrence of C.diff.

   76 yo female with pulm HTN/trach and rrecurrent Cdiff with progressive
   anasarca and acute on chronic respiratory failure. Undergoing
   CVVH/fluid removal in an attempt to ultimatley become
   ventilator-independent during the day. so far weight down 30kg since
   admission, but no change in vent requirements with BP more recently
   limiting fluid removal.
   1. Fevers-
   started on Vanc/Cefipime for presumptive VAP- has Pseudomonas growing
   from cultures. WBC is down this morning. will complete 8 day course
   2. Hypotension- decreased pressor requirement. Will continue dopamine
   to maintain MAP>60
   3. Recurrent Cdiff- on po vancomycin
   4. Acute respiratory failure: Pt currently on AC ventilation and PEEP
   of 15. pO2's have been too low to allow for PEEP reduction- will
   re-check ABG. Otherwise, continue mechanical ventilation
   5. Recent trach bleed- no further active bleeding. continue to trend
   crits
   6. Renal failure: On CVVH, but have been unable to remove much fluid
   recently due to low BP's.
   7. DM- transitioned to SQ insulin yesterday but with high BG's
   consistently in the 200's. Will re-adjust standing doses.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with severe pulmonary hypertension and a tracheostomy.
- She has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- The patient's current condition includes hypotension, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, acute on chronic respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity.
- She is critically ill and requires ventilatory support.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, which were initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, cultures revealed growth of Pseudomonas, so the antibiotic regimen will be completed for an additional 8 days.
- Her blood pressure is currently stable, and the dopamine infusion will be continued to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- She is being treated for recurrent C. difficile infection with oral vancomycin.
- The patient's acute respiratory failure requires continued mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15. ABG results will be rechecked to determine if PEEP reduction is possible.
- There was a recent tracheostomy bleed, but no further active bleeding is present.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is undergoing CVVH, but fluid removal has been limited due to low blood pressure.
- Her diabetes management is being adjusted, transitioning to subcutaneous insulin, but her blood glucose levels remain high, requiring re-adjustment of standing doses"

   78 y/o female ICU d 16, with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF,
   AFib, chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening
   mental status and failure to improve.
    #  Leukocytosis- trending up. Infection could explain her poor mental
   status.
   -On Vanc and Cefepime for VAP Day [**1-31**]
   -continue to check Blood Cxs
   - f/u cultures from [**7-10**]
   # Hypotension-
    -on Dopamine 9 (from 8)mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60
   # Right arm infiltration- no apparent increased edema.  If worsens or
   painful, or decrease in neuro/vascular function consult plastics
    # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 3
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**7-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
    # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach
   - Will continue CVVH
   - Does not seem that patient will tolerate wean at this point
   #Renal failure
   - Will continue CVVH however not optimistic that will be able to get
   off much more fluids with BP tolerating.
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Anemia
   -stable Hct o/n
   - on EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   -per thoracics: if rebleeds, would want to consider source in deep lung
   parenchyma
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
   - insulin slidding scale and Lantus 40
   - will monitor blood sugar
   # GERD

   # Decubitus Ulcers

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female in the ICU with multiple medical conditions including chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. difficile infection, and obesity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for worsening mental status and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate, dopamine, KCl, heparin sodium, famotidine, and insulin. She is also receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) due to renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, and impaired kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, right arm infiltration, chronic C. difficile infection, respiratory failure, renal failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, anemia, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and impaired skin integrity with decubitus ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, recurrent C. difficile infection, renal failure, cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias, and pressure ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents with worsening mental status and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleed, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and previous C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and known funguria, suggesting a possible ascending infection. She is on fluconazole for suspected colonization. She also has a history of chronic C. diff infection and previous antibiotic use, which increases the risk of antibiotic-associated infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires dopamine to maintain adequate blood pressure. There is a plan to wean the dopamine for a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.
3. Right arm infiltration: The patient has right arm infiltration, but it does not seem to cause any increased edema. If it worsens or affects neuro/vascular function, plastics consultation will be sought.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and does not seem to tolerate weaning from mechanical ventilation. It is unclear if she will be able to tolerate weaning in the future.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is also on CVV"

","Summary:
The patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis trending up, which could indicate an ongoing infection. This could explain her poor mental status.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on dopamine to maintain blood pressure and target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. Close monitoring is required to prevent hypoperfusion.
3. Right arm infiltration: There is a history of right arm infiltration, but no apparent increased edema. If the condition worsens, consultation with plastics may be necessary.
4. C.diff Infection: The patient has a history of C.diff infection. Prophylaxis with PO vancomycin for 14 days after the last dose of cipro is recommended. If recurrence occurs, refer to the ID note from [**2117-7-2**].
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) will be continued, and peep will be decreased as tolerated.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and CVVH will be continued. Fluid removal may be limited due to the patient's blood pressure.
7. Diastolic Heart Failure/Volume Overload: The patient shows no response to lasix or zeroxylyn. CVVH will be used to manage fluid overload.
8. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels but is on EPO for anemia. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site may contribute to anemia, and further evaluation is needed.
9. A.fib/Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR due to poor absorption and production. Anticoagulation may be considered once stable.
10. DM2: The patient requires insulin sliding scale and Lantus 40 for glycemic control. Lantus dosage may be increased to 45 units in the morning if blood glucose levels remain elevated.
11. GERD: The patient has been prescribed H2B for GERD management.
12. Decubitus Ulcers: Wound care consultation has been sought, and recommendations are being followed.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea requiring tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60-73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator. Her current medications include dopamine, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and various other ICU medications.

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, normal sodium level of 139 mg/dL, slightly low potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 32 mg/dL, and decreased albumin level of 3.1 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals edema on her left wrist, coarse breath sounds diffusely anteriorly, and no jugular venous distention. She has a history of chronic anemia and obesity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea requiring tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute pain, chronic pain, malnutrition, hypothermia, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, other heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and chronic C. difficile infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a chronic C. difficile infection and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is a risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Renal failure: The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for acute renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function or complications related to the CVVH procedure.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, and dopamine infusion is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. There is a risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoperfusion if the blood pressure drops further.
4. Wrist swelling: The patient"

   78 y/o female ICU d 16, with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF,
   AFib, chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening
   mental status and failure to improve.
    #  Leukocytosis- trending up. Infection could explain her poor mental
   status.
   -On Vanc and Cefepime for VAP Day [**3-31**]
   -continue to check Blood Cxs
   - f/u cultures from [**7-10**]--still pending
   # Hypotension-
    -on Dopamine 9 (from 8)mcg/kg/min; wean for goal MAP of 60
   # Right arm infiltration- no apparent increased edema.  If worsens or
   painful, or decrease in neuro/vascular function consult plastics
    # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 3
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro (D1=[**8-7**], last
   day = [**7-20**]), then stop and observe for recurrence of c.diff. If
   recurrence see ID note from [**2117-7-2**]
    # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach, decreasing PEEP
   - Will continue CVVH
   - continue to decrease PEEP. Maintain same fiO2
   #Renal failure
   - Will continue CVVH however not optimistic that will be able to get
   off much more fluids with BP tolerating.
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    - Continue gentle CVVH per renal, watch for hypotension
   # Anemia
   -stable Hct o/n
   - on EPO
   - likely due in part to bleed from trach site as has been guiac +
   -per thoracics: if rebleeds, would want to consider source in deep lung
   parenchyma
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - rate control PRN though on Dopamine and has been brady-normal
   # DM2
   - insulin slidding scale and Lantus 45
   - will plan to increase lantus to 50 units in the AM if BG still
   elevated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring tracheostomy, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as medications for other conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), heart failure, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 96/45 mmHg and a heart rate of 85 bpm. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL. The patient's renal function is impaired, and she has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. Monitoring oxygenation levels and ensuring proper ventilation support is necessary.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, indicating impaired kidney function. Regular monitoring of renal parameters and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be required.

3. Heart disease: The patient has atrial fibrillation and a systolic murmur. Further evaluation of the heart's function and potential treatment options should be considered.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers or bedsores, which require regular skin assessment and appropriate management to prevent infection and promote healing.

5. Chronic anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating chronic anemia. Blood transfusion or other interventions may be necessary to address this condition.

6. Obesity: The patient is overweight or obese, which can increase the risk of various complications such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and joint problems. Lifestyle modifications and nutritional counseling should be considered upon recovery.

7. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and bowel management strategies are required.

8. HEMATEMESIS (upper gastrointestinal bleed): The patient has experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on tracheostomy ventilation. She will continue with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and the ventilator settings will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Infection: Leukocytosis indicates possible infection, which could explain her poor mental status. She is already on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and cultures are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient has dropping hemoglobin levels, possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding. A transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is planned to address the anemia and tachycardia.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is managed with dopamine, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. If tachycardia persists after transfusion, low-dose vasopressin may be considered.
5. Wrist Swelling: The patient has swelling in her left wrist,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, shock, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/44 to 128/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

The patient has been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with potassium chloride infusion at a rate of 3 mEq/hour. They have also been on heparin sodium for prophylaxis since July 13th. Other medications include cefepime, H2B, vancomycin orally, bowel regimen, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), statin, aspirin, lidocaine patch, and vancomycin intravenously.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.3 g/dL, platelet count of 212 K/uL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 96 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 32 mEq/L, glucose of 157 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, lactate of 0.7 mmol/L, and albumin of 3.1 g/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg, oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 157 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 32 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds with no murmur, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is responsive to verbal stimuli and exhibits non-purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum remains polyfloral, and they have been febrile. VAP is a potential complication in mechanically ventilated patients, and the patient will be committed to an 8-day course of antibiotics.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a midline catheter in place since June 26th. CLABSI is a potential complication associated with central lines.
3. Catheter-related urinary tract infection (CRUTI): The patient has a dialysis catheter in place since June"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently has a tracheostomy and is on invasive ventilation. ABG results show different readings from right (R) and left (L) sides, indicating a possible ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The renal fellow believes that continuing with CVVH may not lead to significant clinical improvement and suggests considering weaning off pressors to restart CVVH or exploring long-term dialysis options.

2. Leukocytosis and Infection: The patient's high white blood cell count could indicate an infection, which could also explain her poor mental status. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further cultures are pending.

3. Anemia: The patient did not receive the appropriate amount of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has a history of tracheal bleed. Thoracic surgery is considered if rebleeding occurs, and imaging studies may be ordered to identify the source of bleeding.

4. Wrist Fracture: The patient has wrist swelling, and an X-ray confirms a fracture. The hand has been consulted, and joint fluid was aspirated for culture. A wrist splint is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, anemia, a wrist fracture, a history of C. diff infection, renal failure, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has been on invasive ventilation, received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and has been undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She has had an ABG showing different reads from right to left, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's mental status has been attributed to an infection, for which she is receiving Vancomycin and Cefepime.

The patient's anemia has not been appropriately corrected, possibly due to a history of tracheal bleed and ongoing bleeding. The source of the bleed should be investigated, especially if further hemoglobin drop occurs. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been started to address the anemia.

The patient's wrist swelling was found to be caused by a fracture, confirmed by an X-ray. Joint fluid was aspirated"

   come off in time.
   - Pt did not bump appropriately to 2 u pRBC.
   - Put in IR order to re-site temporarily dialysis catheter
   - Wrist film was concerning for fracture
   - Hand tapped a couple of drops of joint fluid and sent for culture.

","The patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, leukocytosis, anemia, wrist fracture, altered mental status, renal failure, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection.

The medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. ABG results show different readings from right to left, indicating ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The goal is to continue maximizing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) to remove excess fluid.
2. Anemia: The patient did not receive the expected 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to a history of tracheal bleed. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of ongoing blood loss.
3. Wrist fracture: The patient's wrist x-ray shows a fracture, and a splint has been applied. Joint fluid was tapped, and cultures are pending.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection. Recent stool cultures are negative for the infection.
5. Renal failure: The patient is undergoing CVVH,"

    # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach
   -ABGs have been relatively stable
   -continue current settings
   - Renal feels that we are nearing the end point with CVVH. However, we
   will continue to maximize CVVH, and are willing to max out on current
   pressures to Dopamine of [**12-7**] in order to continue to remove fluid.
   Goal for CVVH is negative 50cc/hr
   -Since dopamine was causing ectopy; added vasopressin with increased
   pain med need
   #  Leukocytosis- WBC improving
   -On Vanc and Cefepime for VAP Day [**6-30**]; holding Vanc because of high

 likely secondary to pain medications; if
   still present at 2pm, head CT to r/o bleed/stroke
   # Anemia
 Did not bump appropriately to 2U pRBCs. Guiac + and has h/o
   trach bleed. Per thoracics: if rebleeds, would want to consider source

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, and obesity. She has been on CVVH with a goal of negative 50cc/hr fluid removal. The patient also has leukocytosis, anemia, and a history of tracheal bleed. She is on multiple medications, including vasopressin and pain medications, which may be causing disconjugate eye movements. A head CT has been ordered to rule out bleeding or stroke if the eye movement abnormalities persist.

The patient's wrist shows signs of swelling, and an X-ray revealed a wrist fracture. The patient's pain control has been adjusted, and she has been placed on a lidocaine patch instead of oxycodone and fentanyl. She has had negative cultures for C. diff infection three times and is recommended to continue with PO vancomycin for an additional 14 days after the last dose of antibiotics.

The patient's renal function continues to be monitored, and there is no need for a new dialysis catheter at this time. However, the possibility of changing goals of care may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC).

The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, and has a history of chronic C. difficile infection. She has leukocytosis and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has anemia and is on erythropoietin (EPO). There is a wrist fracture, and the patient has had a joint tap. She has a history of pain control issues and altered mental status. The patient has renal failure and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a concern for volume overload and diastolic heart failure. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and coagulopathy. Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently relies on a tracheostomy for respiratory support. There may be ongoing issues with gas exchange and ventilation.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is being managed with CVVH. There is a concern for fluid overload and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female in the ICU with multiple medical conditions including OSA requiring tracheostomy, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. The ABGs have been relatively stable, but there is a concern for endotracheal tube obstruction or dislodgement.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 50 cc/hr.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia and has experienced bleeding from the tracheostomy site. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the bleeding.
5. Wrist fracture: The patient has a wrist fracture, and joint cultures have been obtained. She has been given pain medication and is currently splinted.
6. C. diff Infection: The patient has had recurrent C. diff infection, but recent tests have been negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She is currently in the ICU for worsening mental status and respiratory failure. The patient is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) with a goal of negative 50cc/hr fluid removal. She is also receiving vasopressin and increased pain medication due to discomfort. The family will have a meeting today to discuss the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern as she requires tracheostomy and has chronic respiratory failure. ABGs (arterial blood gases) have been relatively stable, indicating some improvement in oxygenation and ventilation. However, the patient's ability to maintain adequate respiratory function may be compromised, potentially leading to further respiratory failure.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing CVVH due to acute renal failure. The goal is to remove excess fluid from the body. However, there is a risk of hypotension during the procedure, and the patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate if not managed appropriately.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of tracheal bleed and chronic anemia. Further HCT (hematocrit) drop could indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production. Monitoring of blood counts and consideration of transfusions or other interventions may be"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring tracheostomy, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, chronic renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, and obesity. She presents from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The current ventilator settings need to be adjusted to attempt weaning her from the ventilator. Decreasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 15 to 13 cmH2O is recommended.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and it is nearing the end point with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has increased ventricular ectopy, and vasopressin has been added to support dialysis fluid removal. There is no more room to remove fluid, so restarting CVVF with the goal of euvolemia on Monday is planned.

3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) that resolved spontaneously. The patient's heart rhythm improved in regularity after changing from dopamine to neos"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, chronic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with unchanged settings for the past three days. There is a plan to attempt weaning her from the vent by decreasing PEEP from 15 to 13. ABGs have been relatively stable, indicating that the respiratory status is currently stable.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evidenced by increased ventricular ectopy and the need to change from dopamine to neosynephrine with vasopressin to support dialysis fluid removal. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been restarted with the goal of achieving euvolemia.

3. Hematemesis (Upper GI Bleed, UGIB): The patient has a history of tracheostomy bleed, and further evaluation is needed to rule out ongoing bleeding, especially considering the presence of heme-positive guaiac.

4. C. difficile Infection (C. diff colitis): The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection, and appropriate treatment with oral vancomycin is recommended after the completion of antibiotic therapy.

   76 yo woman with long-term tracheostomy, with acute on chronic
   respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory Failure: Pt has been intolerant of decreases in
   level of vent support.  Have now made patient close to dry with CVVH
   will try decreasing PEEP today. If pt tolerates small changes, can
   consider change to PSV.
   2.       Renal Failure: Holding further CVVH for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with long-term tracheostomy and acute on chronic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been intolerant of decreases in the level of vent support. She has been made close to dry with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and will try decreasing PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) today. If the patient tolerates small changes, she can be considered for a change to PSV (pressure support ventilation). The patient also has renal failure, anemia, and bleeding from the guaiac positive stools and sq heparin site. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 91/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and encephalopathic. The patient has multiple lines, including a midline, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include SQ UF heparin for DVT prevention, PPI for stress ulcer prevention, and HOB elevation and mouth care for VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

   respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory Failure: Pt has been intolerant of decreases in
   level of vent support.  Have now made patient close to dry with CVVH
   will try decreasing PEEP today. If pt tolerates small changes, can
   consider change to PSV.
   2.       Renal Failure: Holding further CVVH for now.
   3.       Anemia: Has had blood loss from guiaic pos stools and sq
   heparin site.  Will rechaeck Hct and transfuse as needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a long-term tracheostomy, who is currently experiencing acute on chronic respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 91/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is also diagnosed with renal failure, anemia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intolerance to decreases in vent support indicates a potential risk of further respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustments to ventilation settings will be necessary.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure may require further intervention, such as continuing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) or considering other renal replacement therapies.
3. Anemia: The patient's blood loss from guaiac positive stools and sq heparin site indicates a risk of worsening anemia. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed will be essential.
4. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support suggests a potential risk of shock. Continued monitoring and adjustment of vasopressor therapy will be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill, and close monitoring and management of her respiratory, renal, anemic, and hypotensive conditions are crucial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve. She has several ongoing medical issues such as respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, chronic anemia, obesity, pain control, malnutrition, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and a history of C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy and has stable ABGs. The goal is to wean PEEP today and continue monitoring.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is being supported by CVVH, but with increased ventricular ectopy, the physician has changed the medication to neosynephrine with Vasopressin to support the dialysis removal of fluid. The plan is to continue CVVH with the goal of weaning pressure support.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient has a history of tracheal bleed and an elevated HCT after transfusion. The plan is to monitor HCT every 8 hours, transfuse for drop >3, continue IV PPI, and hold ASA due to GIB.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is improving, and she is being treated with PO"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obstructive sleep apnea, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. Her current ventilator settings are unchanged since yesterday PM, and she is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good arterial blood gases (ABGs). ABGs have been relatively stable, and they will continue to be checked every 6 hours.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure. There has been increased ventricular ectopy, so the patient was switched from dopamine to neosynephrine with vasopressin to support fluid removal during dialysis. Vasopressin has been stopped now. The goal is to achieve euvolemia by Monday.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has had ectopy on dopamine, which was changed to vasopressin and neosynephrine. The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 55.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is improving. She is still on oral vancomycin for "

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean her off the ventilator. Decreasing PEEP from 15 to 13 is planned.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is nearing the end point with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Increased ventricular ectopy has been observed, so the patient has been changed from dopamine to neosynephrine with Vasopressin to support the dialysis removal of fluid. There is no more room to remove fluid, and CVVF will be restarted with the goal of euvolemia on Monday.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is improving. She has been on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and vancomycin is being held due to high trough levels. Cultures will be followed up.
4. Anemia"

   # GIB- Hcts currently stable s/p transfusion yesterday
   - Guiac + and has h/o trach bleed. Per thoracics: if rebleeds, would
   want to consider source in deep lung parenchyma
   - check Hcts Q8H, transfuse for drop >3
   - cont IV PPI
   -hold ASA given GIB and ASA being used for long term benefit of
   anticoagulation with afib; continue Heparin SC given high risk of DVT
   and little bleeding risk with Heparin SC pphx
   #  Leukocytosis- WBC improving
   -cont PO Vanc for 14 days D1 [**7-17**]
   -f/u cultures
   - ctx off aline/midline given they have been in place long-term

   Pt seen and examined with housestaff team.  Agree with above.  I would
   also add the following:  pt has actually been able to tolerate PSV
   since yesterday
 will continue for now as long as she tolerates.  Will
   hold off on pulling off further fluid by CVVH for now.  Pt is

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. There is a need to wean the ventilator settings and eventually remove the tracheostomy tube.

2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and CVVH may need to be continued or weaned off based on the patient's condition.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the Hct (hematocrit) levels are stable after a recent transfusion. Close monitoring of the patient's bleeding status is necessary, and further interventions may be required to control any potential bleeding episodes.

4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. difficile infection, which has been negative on three occasions. It is important to continue following infection control recommendations to prevent further infections.

5. Diastolic heart failure/volume overload: The patient is experiencing diastolic heart failure with volume overload. Management strategies such as holding CVVH and optimizing fluid balance should be implemented.

6. Atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and there is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. difficile infection, and respiratory failure. She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, pain control, altered nutrition, hypothermia, anemia, and chronic heart disease. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which has been negative for the past three tests. The patient's recent events include being on CVVH, weaned off pressors, and having small amounts of bright red vaginal/rectal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 103/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's imaging shows potential fluid build-up in the chest. The patient's plan includes weaning off CVVH, continuing with tracheostomy tube, and monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with worsening mental status and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown stable ABGs. The goal is to decrease PEEP and eventually wean off the ventilator. She is off pressors currently but has had very little urine output (UOP) and rising creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. Dialysis will be discussed once she is breathing on her own.

The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with stable hematocrit (Hct) after transfusion. She is on IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and will continue to have Hct checked every 12 hours. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving subcutaneous heparin.

Other findings include leukocytosis with improving WBC counts, wrist fracture, and a history of C. difficile infection. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin sliding scale and Lantus. Decubitus ulcers are being treated with wound care consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and has a history of chronic respiratory failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. difficile infection. She presents to the ICU with worsening mental status and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, pain control issues, altered nutrition, hypothermia, anemia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results. There is a plan to wean PEEP today. ABGs will be checked every 6 hours.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output (UOP) is very low and creatinine levels are rising. CVVH may need to be restarted, but this could cause the patient to go back on pressors. A new dialysis catheter might be required.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has stable hematocrit (Hct) levels after a recent transfusion. There is a concern for rebleeding, particularly from deep lung parenchyma sources. Hct levels will be monitored every 8 hours, and transfusion will be given for a drop of >3. IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will continue, and aspirin (ASA) will be held due to the risk of bleeding.

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach
   - on PSV/PEEP [**4-27**], good ABGS over night. Try trach mask
   - ABGs have been relatively stable, continue to check q6hrs
   - Get CXR
    #Renal failure
   - Pt now off pressure support, but has had very little UOP and Cr in
   rising again. Will wait to start any type of dialysis until we can have
   her breathing on her own. Then we will discuss possibility for HD with
   Renal.
   - Renal would like new line only if we continue with CVVH. Line is
   working fine and has no issues. Currently off CVVH so will hold off for
   now
   #FEN: Speak to nutrition about going back to Peptamen. Hyponatremia
   likely [**1-25**] increased volume in Vivonex. Monitor Na w/ PM lytes.
   # [**Name (NI) 9721**] Pt has not needed pressors.
   -goal MAP >55
   # GIB- Hcts currently stable
   - Guiac + and has h/o trach bleed. Per thoracics: if rebleeds, would
   want to consider source in deep lung parenchyma
   - check Hcts Q12H, transfuse for drop >3
   - cont IV PPI
   -hold ASA given GIB and ASA being used for long term benefit of
   anticoagulation with afib; continue Heparin SC given high risk of DVT
   and little bleeding risk with Heparin SC pphx
    #  Leukocytosis- WBC improving
   -cont PO Vanc for 14 days D1 [**7-17**]. Day [**4-6**] for C. diff prophlaxis
   -f/u cultures
   - ctx taken yesterday off midline given it has been in place long-term
   #L wrist swelling: Xray shows wrist fracture
   - final ctx negative
   -wrist splint currently per hand
   - lidocaine patch for pain control
     # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 3
   - ID recs: PO vanc 14 days after last dose of antibiotics
    # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    -hold CVVH for now
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
 had run of afib with RVR on Friday, stopped
   dopamine
    - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once
   stable
   - HR stable in 80s
   # DM2
   - insulin sliding scale and Lantus 45
   - BG stable
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - wound care consulted; following recommendation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. difficile infection, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, pain control, altered mental status, chronic anemia, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic heart disease, and C. difficile infection.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines the following:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PSV/PEEP). Good arterial blood gas (ABG) results were obtained overnight, and a tracheostomy mask will be tried. ABGs will continue to be checked every 6 hours, and a chest X-ray will be obtained.
2. Renal failure: The patient is now off pressure support, but has had very little urine output and rising creatinine levels. Dialysis will be discussed once the patient can breathe independently. Currently, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is not being used.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, and there is a history of tracheostomy bleed. If rebleeding occurs, consideration will be given to the source in deep lung parenchyma"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach
   - on PSV/PEEP [**4-27**], good ABGS over night. Try trach mask
   - ABGs have been relatively stable, continue to check q6hrs
   - Get CXR
   - Replace ABG if still having issues today
    #Renal failure
   - Pt now off pressure support, but has had very little UOP and Cr in
   rising again. Will wait to start any type of dialysis until we can have
   her breathing on her own. Then we will discuss possibility for HD with
   Renal.
   - Renal would like new line only if we continue with CVVH. Line is
   working fine and has no issues. Currently off CVVH so will hold off for
   now
   #FEN: Speak to nutrition about going back to Peptamen. Hyponatremia
   likely [**1-25**] increased volume in Vivonex. Monitor Na w/ PM lytes.
   # [**Name (NI) 9721**] Pt has not needed pressors.
   -goal MAP >55
   # GIB- Hcts currently stable
   - Guiac + and has h/o trach bleed. Per thoracics: if rebleeds, would
   want to consider source in deep lung parenchyma
   - check Hcts Q12H, transfuse for drop >3
   - cont IV PPI
   -hold ASA given GIB and ASA being used for long term benefit of
   anticoagulation with afib; continue Heparin SC given high risk of DVT
   and little bleeding risk with Heparin SC pphx
    #  Leukocytosis- WBC improving
   -cont PO Vanc for 14 days D1 [**7-17**]. Day [**4-6**] for C. diff prophlaxis
   -f/u cultures
   - ctx taken yesterday off midline given it has been in place long-term
   #L wrist swelling: Xray shows wrist fracture
   - final ctx negative
   -wrist splint currently per hand
   - lidocaine patch for pain control
     # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 3
   - ID recs: PO vanc 14 days after last dose of antibiotics
    # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
    -hold CVVH for now
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
 had run of afib with RVR on Friday, stopped

    - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production now subtherapeutic and will consider anticoagulation once

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including OSA, CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection.
- She presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from LTAC.
- Current medical concerns include respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, heart disease, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, obesity, and C. diff infection.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off pressure support.
- Renal function is deteriorating, with little urine output and rising creatinine levels.
- The patient has a history of tracheal bleed, and there is concern for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Leukocytosis is improving, but the patient remains on prophylactic vancomycin for C. diff.
- The patient has a wrist fracture, for which she is being managed conservatively.
- There are ongoing concerns regarding diabetes, coagulopathy, and pressure ulcers.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off pressure support. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and oxygenation is necessary to ensure adequate respiratory function.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with worsening mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is currently on pressure support ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PSV/PEEP). Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results have been relatively stable overnight. The arterial line needs to be replaced today.

The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by her low urine output and rising creatinine levels. She will eventually require hemodialysis (HD), and a new HD line will be obtained from interventional radiology (IR) for a tunneled HD line and a percutaneous internal jugular (PIC) line. The old midline catheter will be removed.

The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to an increased volume in the Vivonex nutritional formula. Monitoring sodium levels with point-of-care (POC) labs is recommended.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently being monitored with regular Hct checks. If there is rebleeding, consideration should be given to the source in deep lung parenchyma, especially since the patient has a history of tracheal bleeding. Transfusion should be considered for Hct drops greater than "

   - ABGs have been relatively stable, continue to check q6hrs
    #Renal failure
   - Pt now off pressure support, but has had very little UOP and Cr in
   rising again. Will eventually need HD, and will discuss with renal.
   - now has tunnel and PICC, removal of midline
   #FEN: Speak to nutrition about going back to Peptamen. Hyponatremia
   likely [**1-25**] increased volume in Vivonex. Monitor Na w/ PM lytes.

   - Guiac + and has h/o trach bleed. Per thoracics: if rebleeds, would
   want to consider source in deep lung parenchyma
   - check Hcts Q12H, transfuse for drop >3
   - switch to PO PPI
   -hold ASA given GIB and ASA being used for long term benefit of
   anticoagulation with afib; continue Heparin SC given high risk of DVT
   and little bleeding risk with Heparin SC pphx

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. She has been diagnosed with several medical complications including hypothermia, respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. She also has a history of diabetes, decubitus ulcers, and a wrist fracture. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including dialysis, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and is currently on vancomycin prophylaxis. She also has leukocytosis, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Monitoring of cultures and continued antibiotic therapy is important.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by her current use of aspirin. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and consideration of holding aspirin therapy may be necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by rising creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal parameters and initiation of appropriate renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, is essential.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings may be required.

","Summary:
The patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has several ongoing medical issues such as hypothermia, respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, and obesity. She also has a history of C. diff infection, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, atrial fibrillation/coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection and ongoing leukocytosis, indicating the possibility of another infection. Pan culture has been ordered, and the patient is receiving prophylactic Vanc for 14 days.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on tracheal mask ventilation and has stable ABGs. Monitoring will continue after hemodialysis (HD).
3. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is minimal, and creatinine levels are rising. Hemodialysis will be continued, and the renal team will determine the timing of the next session.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is blood oozing from the HD line site. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and if rebleeding occurs, deep lung parench"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity, chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic C. difficile infection, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. The patient presents from a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient has several ongoing medical concerns and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on tracheostomy (trach) and requires respiratory support. ABGs have been relatively stable, so it is important to continue monitoring oxygenation levels every 6 hours.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has minimal urine output (UOP) and rising creatinine levels. Eventually, the patient will need hemodialysis (HD), and discussions will be held with the renal team. The patient currently has a tunneled (Hickman) line and PICC line, and the midline has been removed.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable, but there is a history of tracheostomy bleed. If rebleeding occurs, deep lung parenchyma should be considered as a potential source. Check Hcts every 12 hours and transfuse for drops greater than 3. Switch to oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and hold aspirin due to GIB and its use for long"

The patient presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC). 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, chronic, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/49 mmHg to 166/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, stable hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. 

The patient's management plan includes continuing vasopressor weaning, administering appropriate antibiotics, performing a CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast to evaluate for infectious processes, and initiating continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. 

The patient also requires pain control, nutritional support, and glycemic control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, likely due to an infectious process. She has been weaned off neo and is being continued on vasopression. The pan culture is pending, and a CT abdomen with and without contrast has been ordered to evaluate for an infectious process. The patient is also receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to renal failure.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, and she is now back on mechanical ventilation. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed no source of active bleeding. The negative results from CVVH have ruled out any pulmonary edema.

The patient's anemia is stable, but there is ongoing blood loss from the hemodialysis line and tracheostomy site. Platelets and coagulation studies are normal, suggesting possible platelet dysfunction from aspirin use in the recent past. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels every 8 hours is recommended, and transfusion should be considered for a drop of more than 3 points in hemoglobin.

The patient's history of Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out, as it has tested negative three times. The patient is currently receiving oral vancomycin for a total of"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, has a central venous catheter, and an arterial line. She is receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, insulin, Heparin, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/49 to 166/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 60% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic pain, altered mental status, renal failure, heart disease, respiratory failure, and a recent infection with Clostridium difficile.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension and hypothermia likely due to sepsis, respiratory failure requiring continued mechanical ventilation, renal failure possibly needing continuous renal replacement therapy, anemia, obesity, altered mental status, heart disease, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she has a history of tracheal bleeding.

The patient's medications include vasopressors, insulin, Heparin, and antibiotics for her ongoing infections. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further deterioration in respiratory function, progression of renal failure, development of deep vein thrombosis, and potential bleeding complications due to the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and use of anticoagulants."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy (CVVH). She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests septic shock, likely due to a severe infection. The medical team is administering broad-spectrum antibiotics and performing cultures to identify the causative organism.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation to support her breathing. The ventilator settings will be adjusted based on her ABG results and clinical condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to her septic state or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resulted in significant blood loss. She is at risk for further bleeding, especially if she has a coagulopathy or if the source of bleeding is not identified and managed appropriately.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Insulin therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old woman with complex pulmonary disease (PHTN, OSA, etc.)
   admitted with massive volume overload and respiratory failure.  She had
   improved until yesterday (off pressors, on trach mask x 24 hours) but
   developed hypothermia, shock, and hypoxemia yesterday.  Overall,
   suspect that this represents infection and septic shock though cultures
   are pending.  Her other acute issue is that she has hemoptysis of
   moderate volume (100-200 cc).
   SHOCK, PRESUMPTIVELY SEPTIC
          Follow cultures
          Continue broad empiric antibiotics and antifungals while
   awaiting cultures (d/c if negative on Sunday).
          Source remains uncertain at this point.  Will image abdomen
   today with CT to exclude abscess and small perforation.
          Try off vasopressin
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
          Maintain support while in shock
   RENAL FAILURE
          Resumed CVVHD today
   HEMOPTYSIS
          Suspect this relates to miniBAL.
          Will bronch to assess for ongoing bleeding.
   DELIRIUM / ENCEPHALOPATHY
          Improved somewhat today
          Multiple potential etiologies related to critical illness

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with complex pulmonary disease who was admitted with massive volume overload and respiratory failure. She initially improved but then developed hypothermia, shock, and hypoxemia. The attending physician suspects that this represents infection and septic shock, although cultures are pending. The patient also has moderate hemoptysis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is currently in shock, presumptively septic. This condition requires immediate attention as it can lead to organ failure and death if not properly managed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely related to her underlying pulmonary disease and the massive volume overload. Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. CVVHD (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been resumed to manage the renal failure and remove waste products from the body.

4. Hemoptysis: The patient has moderate hemoptysis, which could be related to the miniBAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) procedure. Further bronchoscopic evaluation is planned to assess for ongoing bleeding and determine the cause of the hemoptysis.

5. Delirium/Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing delirium or encephalopathy, which is likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including OSA requiring tracheostomy, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in septic shock, likely due to a suspected infection as there is no evidence of an intrathoracic or abdominal source on CT scan. She has respiratory failure related to sepsis and is on assisted ventilation. The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast dye used for a CT scan. She is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to the dye load. Other medical complications include anemia and coagulopathy, chronic C. diff infection, diastolic heart failure/volume overload, and dysrhythmias.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in septic shock, which can be a life-threatening condition if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure likely related to sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, possibly due to the administration of contrast dye for a CT scan. CVVH is being performed to manage the renal failure.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. diff infection, obstructive sleep apnea requiring tracheostomy, and chronic renal failure. The patient presented from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, other shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pulmonary hypertension, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, micafungin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), famotidine, dextrose 50%, heparin sodium, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate 86 bpm (67-95), blood pressure 104/45 mmHg (62-121/39-59), respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute (11-28), oxygen saturation 95%, and atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,071 mL and output of 2,978 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,093 mL. The patient's weight is currently 106.7 kg, with a stable hemoglobin concentration.

The patient's laboratory results show the following: white blood cell count 9.7 x 10^9/L (8.4-11.0 x 10^9/L), hematocrit 25.3% (25.2-25.9%), platelet count 226 x 10^9/L (195-400 x 10^9/L), creatinine 3.2 mg/dL (2.7-3.4 mg/dL), blood glucose 42 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL), and other abnormal values.

Imaging studies reveal right lower lobe atelectasis, cardiomegaly, right adrenal nodule, anterior wall hernia without bowel strangulation, diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, distended gallbladder, and no discrete masses, fluid collections, or evidence of abscess formation.

The patient's microbiology results show yeast and gram-positive cocci likely alpha streptococcus from urine culture, and pending results from blood cultures.

The assessment and plan include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, other shock, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, alteration in nutrition, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has septic shock, as indicated by the administration of vanc/cefepime/cipro/micafungin antibiotics and the decision to discontinue antibiotics if cultures are negative. The patient is experiencing volume overload, with a goal of achieving a net negative 1L fluid balance today. Additionally, the patient has renal failure and is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and mouth care have been implemented to reduce the risk.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin have been initiated to prevent DVT.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic H2 blockade therapy has been started to prevent stress ulcers.

4. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for continuous monitoring and management of renal parameters to prevent further deterioration.

5. Nosocomial infections: Due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with complex pulmonary disease who was admitted with massive volume overload and respiratory failure. She is currently recovering from a recent episode of likely septic shock. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Septic shock: The patient has been recovering from a recent episode of likely septic shock. It is important to monitor her vital signs closely and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy until the results of cultures are available.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and the plan is to try pressure support again today. This indicates that the patient may require assistance with breathing, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.

3. Volume overload: The patient has a goal to be net negative 1L today to manage her volume overload. Close monitoring of her fluid balance and urine output is important to prevent further complications related to fluid overload.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). Regular monitoring of her renal parameters is essential.

5. Clostridium difficile (C Diff) infection: The patient has been prescribed oral vancomycin to address a potential C Diff infection. Close monitoring for any signs or symptoms of C Diff infection, such as diarrhea, is necessary.

6. Delirium: The patient is experiencing ongoing ICU delirium. Frequent assessment of"

   3. Volume overload: net negative 1L goal today
   4. Renal Failure: Cont CVVH
   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old woman with complex pulmonary disease (PHTN, OSA, etc.)
   admitted with massive volume overload and respiratory failure.  She had
   improved until yesterday (off pressors, on trach mask x 24 hours) but
   developed hypothermia, shock, and hypoxemia yesterday.  Overall,
   suspect that this represents infection and septic shock though cultures
   are pending.  Her other acute issue is that she has hemoptysis of
   moderate volume (100-200 cc).
   SHOCK, PRESUMPTIVELY SEPTIC
          Follow cultures
          Continue broad empiric antibiotics and antifungals while
   awaiting cultures (d/c if negative on Sunday).
          Source remains uncertain at this point.  Will image abdomen
   today with CT to exclude abscess and small perforation.
          Try off vasopressin
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
          Maintain support while in shock
   RENAL FAILURE
          Resumed CVVHD today
   HEMOPTYSIS
          Suspect this relates to miniBAL.
          Will bronch to assess for ongoing bleeding.
   DELIRIUM / ENCEPHALOPATHY
          Improved somewhat today
          Multiple potential etiologies related to critical illness

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with complex pulmonary disease admitted to the ICU for massive volume overload and respiratory failure. She initially improved but then developed hypothermia, shock, and hypoxemia. The attending physician suspects septic shock, likely due to infection, and is awaiting culture results. The patient also has hemoptysis of moderate volume and is on mechanical ventilation. Other issues include renal failure, delirium/encephalopathy, and potential Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is showing signs of infection and septic shock, which can lead to organ failure, decreased blood pressure, and altered oxygenation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation is not optimized or if there is an underlying lung pathology.
3. Volume overload: The patient has a history of massive volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and further respiratory compromise.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and if not managed properly, it can progress to full-blown renal failure.
5. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis could be a result of miniBAL or other underlying lung pathology, and if it continues, it may lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
6. Delirium/encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing delirium or encephal"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. difficile infection. She presents from a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC) with worsening mental status and failure to improve.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis with organ dysfunction, other shock, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, alteration in nutrition, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm (with a range of 73-97 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 104/41 mmHg (with a range of 60-114/34-71 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on supplemental oxygen

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed:
1. Hypotension: The patient is potentially septic, and there is no evidence of an intrathoracic or abdominal source for infection. Levophed has been restarted overnight for mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60.
2. Respiratory failure: This may be related to sepsis. The patient tolerated pressure support well,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic C. difficile infection, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, alteration in nutrition, anemia, chronic heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection. She is currently on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasoactive agents, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates septic shock, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her underlying chronic respiratory condition is not adequately addressed or if there are complications related to sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if renal function does not improve, leading to further complications like electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension could worsen due to underlying lung conditions or complications from sepsis, potentially causing further respiratory distress.
5. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition can impact her overall health and recovery. Malnutrition may increase the risk of complications and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. difficile infection. She was admitted from a long-term acute care facility with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, other shock, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, alteration in nutrition, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, other heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock. It is important to closely monitor vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, and provide supportive care.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Pressure support may be used to improve oxygenation.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen during respiratory failure. Monitoring of pulmonary pressures and cardiac function is essential.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis and hypoperfusion. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be required, but access issues need to be addressed. Fluid balance and electrolyte management are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, obesity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, other heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a long-term acute care hospital. She is hypotensive and potentially septic, with no evidence of intrathoracic or abdominal source for infection. The patient's urine culture grew yeast, and blood cultures are pending. She is currently receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medication. The patient's respiratory failure may be related to sepsis, and she has been weaned to pressure support. Renal failure is present, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is planned for tomorrow. The patient is also experiencing anemia and coagulopathy, with ongoing bleeding from needle sticks. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is showing signs of severe sepsis with hypotension and organ dysfunction. If left untreated, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and potentially death.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen if not managed appropriately. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including OSA, chronic CHF, AFib, and chronic C. diff infection. She presents from a long-term acute care hospital with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. She has sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, altered mental status, acute renal failure, heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and potential septic picture indicate a risk of sepsis with organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is potentially related to sepsis. Weaning off pressure support has been attempted, but there is a low likelihood of success due to increased fluid burden off HD.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is planned for tomorrow after placing a temporary line.
4. Anemia and coagulopathy: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding from needle sticks, and her hct levels need to be monitored regularly. Transfusion may be required for hct <22.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 78 F with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d
   CHF, AFib, chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening
   mental status and failure to improve.
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Progressive worseing mental status has been a
   slow process and likely related to infection.  However, her normal WBC
   argues against infection.  Could also consider hypoxia as a potential
   cause.  Patient also has a history of stroke, and further stroke could
   explain presentation.  Exam is non-focal however.
   - head CT.  Could consider repeating with contrast, although concerning
   given ARF.  An MRI could be helpful, but patient unlikely to fit.
   - sputum, blood, urine, stool cultures
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   C DIFFICILE INFECTION: Patient has had severe malnutrition from
   longstanding C. diff infection that has perisisted despite PO
   Vancomycin.
   - continue PO Vanc
   - GI consult, regarding other interventions including IVIG
   - stop PPI
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with severe obstructive apnea and obesity
   hypoventilation.  She has been trach dependent since [**2087**].  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   increasing restriction from anisarca and volume overload from diastolic
   failure.  BNP and CXR c/w volume overload.  Pulmonary hypertension seen
   previosly may be related to LV failure and chornic hypoventilation.
   Also with abnormal sputum appearence.  Would avoid pulmonary
   vasodilator given potential for percipitating diastolic decompensation.
   - sputum culture
   - consider CT chest to eval for PNA
   - diuresis with Lasix 40 IV
   - follow ABG
   .
   DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Volume overloaded on admission.
   - diuresis
   - rate control as needed.
   - consider restarting statin
   .
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr on admission 1.9.  was 1.1-2.2 since
   [**Month (only) 1996**], prior had been around 1.3.
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus.
   - Continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-26**]
   - rate control as needed, currently with HR in 60s.
   .
   H/O BREAST CANCER: Continue arimidex.
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Start insulin sliding scale
   .
   GERD: Stable on PPI.
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: Stable on simvastatin
   .
   Stage II sacral decub: Monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, chronic C. diff infection, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and stage II sacral decubitus ulcer. She presented to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve. Her vital signs are stable, but she has intermittent hypoglycemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy and has a central line, arterial line, and peripheral IV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's progressive worsening mental status could be related to infection, hypoxia, or a potential stroke. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Chronic C. Difficile Infection: The patient has severe malnutrition from a longstanding C. diff infection. Treatment includes continuing PO Vancomycin and considering other interventions such as IVIG.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe obstructive apnea and obesity hypoventilation. She is tracheostomy-dependent and has increasing restriction from anisarca and volume overload from diastolic failure. Pulmonary hypertension may be related to LV failure and chronic hypoventilation. Avoid pulmonary vasodilators due to potential for precipitating diastolic decompensation.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is volume overloaded on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and a history of breast cancer. She presents with altered mental status and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU for worsening mental status and failure to improve. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/53 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 bpm. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode and supplemental oxygen. Her respiratory support parameters are within normal limits, but she has intermittent hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which was treated with the initiation of levophed. The plan is to wean levophed as tolerated and start midodrine.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's worsening mental status is a concern. Possible causes include infection, hypoxia, or a history of stroke. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Chronic Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a history of chronic C. diff infection, which has persisted despite receiving PO vancomycin. Treatment for C. diff should continue, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of worsening infection.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe obstructive apnea and obesity hypoventilation"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided information. However, based on the progress note, the patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic C. difficile infection, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient was admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status and failure to improve. The assessment and plan indicate several potential complications that could arise:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which was secondary to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). The patient was restarted on levophed, a medication used to increase blood pressure. The plan is to wean levophed as tolerated, but this may be complicated by CVVHD.

2. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient's mental status has been progressively worsening. Possible causes include infection, hypoxia, and a history of stroke. Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up on sputum, blood, urine, and stool cultures, as well as continuing CVVH and monitoring electrolytes.

3. C. DIFFICILE INFECTION: The patient has a severe malnutrition due to longstanding C. difficile infection that has persisted despite oral vancomycin. The plan is to continue PO Vanc and use an H2 blocker.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 78 F with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d
   CHF, AFib, chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening
   mental status and failure to improve.
   .
   HYPOTENSION: patient hypotensive overnight. Restarted on levophed.
   - wean levophed
   - cont midodrine
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Progressive worseing mental status has been a
   slow process and likely related to infection.  However, her normal WBC
   argues against infection.  Could also consider hypoxia as a potential
   cause.  Patient also has a history of stroke, and further stroke could
   explain presentation.  Exam is non-focal however.
   - follow up on sputum, blood, urine and stool cultures, abx currently
   d/c
ed except for PO vanc.
   - CVVH
   - follow electrolytes
   .
   C DIFFICILE INFECTION: Patient has had severe malnutrition from
   longstanding C. diff infection that has perisisted despite PO
   Vancomycin.
   - continue PO Vanc
   - on H2 blocker
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with severe obstructive apnea and obesity
   hypoventilation.  She has been trach dependent since [**2087**].  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   increasing restriction from anisarca and volume overload from diastolic
   failure.  BNP and CXR c/w volume overload.  Pulmonary hypertension seen
   previosly may be related to LV failure and chornic hypoventilation.
   Also with abnormal sputum appearence.  Would avoid pulmonary
   vasodilator given potential for percipitating diastolic decompensation.
   - Continue CPAP
   - adequate ABG, follow ABG
   - diurese with CVVHD
   .
   DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Volume overloaded on admission.
   - diuresis
   - rate control as needed
   .
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr on admission 1.9.  was 1.1-2.2 since
   [**Month (only) 1996**], prior had been around 1.3. CVVHD.
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus.
   - rate control as needed, currently with HR in 60s.
   .
   H/O BREAST CANCER: Continue arimidex.
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: hypoglycemic overnight. Decrease glargine to
   30.
   .
   GERD: Stable on H2 blocker.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including hypoglycemia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, shock, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, altered mental status, renal failure, heart disease, hemoptysis, chronic respiratory failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from a previous long-term acute care facility. The patient requires tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive overnight and required levo (vasopressor) even after CVVH was stopped. The plan is to wean off levophed today, restart CVVH once the patient is normotensive, check lactate on ABG as a measure of perfusion, and continue midodrine.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level on admission was 1.9, which has been fluctuating between 1.1-2.2 since [Month 1996]. It is planned to run CVVH even once off pressors and switch to hemodialysis (HD) for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to recent sepsis on top of chronic respiratory failure. The plan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of MMP including OSA requiring trach, CHF, AFib, chronic C. diff infection. He presents with worsening mental status and failure to improve from LTAC. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, funguria, altered mental status, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient required levo pressor overnight and received 2 units of PRBC for volume and drop in HCT. The plan is to wean levophed today, restart CVVH once normotensive, check lactate on ABG as a measure of perfusion, and continue midodrine.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's Cr level on admission was 1.9, which was within the range of 1.1-2.2 since [Month] 1996. The plan is to run CVVH even once off pressors and switch to HD for discharge to a rehab facility.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has chronic respiratory failure and it is expected to continue PSV and attempt to wean as tolerated today, run CVVH even once off pressors, and ABG q12hr.
4. Anemia: The patient's current HCT is 23.4 with a 3-point drop overnight."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, breast cancer, and chronic C. difficile infection. She was admitted with a decline in mental status and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, C. difficile infection, altered nutrition, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, altered mental status, and chronic heart disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This can lead to systemic inflammation and can affect multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is in acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening. It may result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the buildup of waste products in the body.

4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to intravascular depletion. This can compromise blood flow to vital organs and result in organ damage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, altered mental status, heart disease, chronic respiratory failure, and obesity. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ failure, respiratory distress, and shock.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not adequately supplying oxygen to the body or removing carbon dioxide. This condition can progress to respiratory arrest and may require mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. Hypotension can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ ischemia. If left untreated, it can progress to shock and organ failure.

5. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has"
