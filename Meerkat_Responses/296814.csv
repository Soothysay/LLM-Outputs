   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with no previous medical history who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest and was successfully revived with CPR/AED en route to the emergency room. The patient has allergies to penicillins and received antibiotics last dose unknown. He is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 107/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal range. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent sudden cardiac arrest.

The patient's physical examination shows no abnormalities in the general, HEENT, neck, cardiac, or extremities assessment. However, there are some notable findings in the lungs, abdomen, and skin. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, while other values such as creatinine, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's troponin-T level is significantly elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.

The patient's assessment and plan include three main areas of concern: sudden cardiac arrest, cognitive impairment, and an upcoming MRI. The patient's sudden cardiac arrest occurred despite having excellent exercise tolerance and a normal stress echo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a sudden cardiac arrest that occurred after being revived with CPR/AED en route to the emergency department. The patient had an excellent exercise tolerance at baseline and normal stress echo 4 years prior. Admission cardiac cath showed no coronary artery disease, and an ECHO was within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55%. The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since admission, with some mild chest tightness in the morning. The pain was left-sided, non-pleuritic, non-radiating, and likely related to anxiety. Cardiac enzymes were normal, and the EKG was unchanged. The patient will undergo a cardiac MRI today, follow-up with the electrophysiology (EP) team for ICD placement likely on Tuesday, and continue beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary vasospasm: Although the patient's coronary arteries were clean, there is a possibility of coronary vasospasm that resolved prior to taking an EKG. This should be monitored closely.
2. Cognitive impairment: The patient experienced short-term memory deficits secondary to hypoxia in the setting of recent arrest. Neurologic status should continue to be monitored, and a neurology consult has been ordered.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures. Prophylactic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with no previous medical history who experienced sudden cardiac arrest and was revived with CPR/AED en route to the emergency room. He has undergone cardiac catheterization showing no coronary artery disease, an echocardiogram with normal findings and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55%, and an EKG with LVH and ST-T wave configuration consistent with early repolarization pattern. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, and is scheduled for a cardiac MRI and ICD placement. He has cognitive impairment secondary to hypoxia during the recent arrest but is showing signs of improvement. He will be monitored closely, with plans to consult a neurologist on Monday. The patient's diet will be cardiac-healthy, and he will be NPO pre-procedure in a day or two. He will be transferred to the CCU and then to the floor after the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's recent cardiac arrest and the presence of LVH on the EKG, there is a potential risk of recurrent arrhythmias.
2. Cognitive Impairment: The patient's STM deficits are improving but will require continued monitoring, and there is a possibility of further cognitive impairment or development of long-term neurological deficits.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with no known history of coronary artery disease and minimal CAD risk factors. He presented after experiencing sudden cardiac arrest and was revived with CPR/AED en route to the emergency department. Since admission, he has been in normal sinus rhythm with occasional alarms for sinus bradycardia and rare premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The patient has been asymptomatic but reported some mild chest tightness in the morning of [**10-12**]. The pain was left-sided, non-pleuritic, non-radiating, and he denied shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. His EKG showed no changes and cardiac enzymes were normal. The patient's cognitive impairment secondary to hypoxia from the recent arrest has improved steadily during the course of admission, and he is expected to have a full recovery. The patient is scheduled for an electrophysiology (EP) study and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement today. He will continue on beta-blocker therapy with Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg (switchable to 25mg Toprol XL on discharge) and continuous telemetry monitoring. The patient will be discharged to the floor today following ICD placement."

The patient is a 51-year-old man with no known history of coronary artery disease and minimal CAD risk factors. He presented after experiencing sudden cardiac arrest, but was revived with CPR/AED en route to the emergency department. His admission cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. Since admission, he has been in normal sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia and has been asymptomatic. However, he reported mild chest tightness in the morning of [**10-12**], which was left-sided, non-pleuritic, non-radiating, and associated with mild anxiety. His cardiac enzymes were normal, and it is likely that this episode was related to anxiety rather than coronary vasospasm. The patient will undergo a cardiac MRI today and is planned for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement with the electrophysiology team, likely on Tuesday [**10-13**]. He will be NPO past midnight and will continue on beta-blocker therapy with Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg, which can be switched to Toprol XL on discharge. Continuous telemetry monitoring and daily EKGs will also be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary vasospasm: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes were normal and the episode of chest tightness was likely related to anxiety, there is still a possibility of underlying"
