   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - HD early in afternoon.
   - IR procedure at 16:00 interupted HD
   - IR drained thick purulent fluid and placed drain
   - Hypoglycemic after IR procedure to 9 by fingerstick on returning to
   the floor. Pushed 25 g dextrose with recovery. Given juice.
   - Hepatology: Do not use G-tube. Continue antibiotic Rx. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   previously underestimated degree of liver failure. Could be stage IV.
   - Somnolent most of the day.
   - Occasional PVCs on telemetry.
   - WBC climbing - 23.9 > 38.4 > 39.2. Suspicion for C. diff. given
   diarrhea, also other infections: sepsis, abdominal wall. HD stable
   overnight and afebrile.
   - Some loose stool in the evening - partly dried on mat and not send
   for C. diff.
   - Started on empiric enteral vancomycin given no stool sent and WBC
   climbing.
   - Refused dailysis this a.m. (Renal would like to have done this this
   morning because she really had very little fluid off last session).
   - Started stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 25 mg Q8H IV).

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall ?abscess.  In setting of recent PEG placement [**1-6**] by
   GI.  Mutiple gas pockets concerning for abscess.  Appears to be all
   within anterior abdominal wall; no evidence of collection
   intraperitoneally.  Radiology has reviewed; willing to attempt
   drainage.  Awaiting formal GI and surgical input (if GI has opinion on
   [**Doctor First Name **] vs. IR management).
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube.
   - GI made aware and will see patient.
   - Appreciate gen [**Doctor First Name **] input.
   - Decision re: IR/rads drainage vs. surgical drainage after discussion
   with all teams.
   - Vanco/zosyn for antibiotics.  Further tailoring antibiotics based on
   abscess drainage results.
   - Low threshold for stress dose steroids given prolonged steroid
   course.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia/DM.  Likely due to severity of infection and
   inflammatory state.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be contribution from now improved
   nutrition with PEG tube.  Outpatient insulin doses unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] current
   evidence of ketones in serum or urine currently, though has had anion
   gap. A
   - Check serum ketones here (and UA if voids again).
   - Obtain home doses of insulin from family and/or pharmacy.
   - Insulin gtt likely for today given profound hyperglycemia and desire
   to acheive relatively good glucose control with current infection.
   Consider SQ dose later today if control improves.
   - Monitor K closely with insulin treatment (ESRD but may be K depleted
   from urinary losses, as does produce urine).
   - Hold off on further fluids for now (not volume depleted by exam and
   somewhat protected from usual osmotic diuresis due to ESRD) but low
   threshold to start.
   .
   # UTI. Positive UA at OSH.
   - Resend urine here.
   - Call OSH tomorrow for UCx results.
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improving as day goes on.  At baseline lives at home but
   requires signficant help from daughter and [**Name (NI) **]; does not due own tube
   feeds.  Concern for ?depression with last admit.  Also was overnight
   admit, may just be sleep deprived.  Nothing focal (other than chronic
   deficits) on neuro exam.  Most likely systemic effects of infection;
   much less likely primary CNS insult (stroke, bleed, meningitis).
   - Continue to monitor.
   - Consider head CT, LP in light of leukocytosis, but again other
   etiologies more likely.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Elevated bicarb at OSH on VBG -
   ?chronic CO2 retention.  Bicarb now 28 with AG 16 (worse than looks
   with likely low albumin).  Renal failure vs. lactate vs. ketones
   (though no evidence of ketones thus far).
   - Check serum acetone.
   - Check lactate.
   .
   # ESRD.  Usual HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R tunnelled line.
   - Renal aware; likely no acute indication for HD today provided K stays
   low.
   .
   # Anemia.  Concern for GIB at OSH.  Stools guiaiac pos but brown;
   gastrocult positive from PEG tube.  Had 4 point Hct drop compared to
   last known values, but with appropriate bump to OSH transfusion
   - Defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope.
   .
   # Chronic hep B infection/cholangiopathy.  Bili slightly up above
   baseline.
   - Hold entecavir/tenofovir given reluctancy to use PEG right now.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - Consider flagyl or rule out C.diff (though diarrhea longstanding).

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise, and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for abdominal wall abscess. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic liver disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and depression. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient has an established abscess in the abdominal wall, which may require drainage. There is a concern for infection and sepsis, especially given her immunocompromised state due to malnutrition and diabetes.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has nonketotic hyperglycemia, which could be due to stress from infection or improved nutrition with PEG tube. It is important to maintain good glycemic control to prevent complications.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urine analysis at OSH, suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic coverage should be initiated, and further evaluation of the UTI is required.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires regular dialysis sessions. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is crucial.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped significantly,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise, and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and a concern for an abdominal wall abscess. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to drain the abscess, and purulent fluid was obtained. Gram stain results showed the presence of Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and budding yeast. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient is currently on stress dose steroids, IV antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), and empiric enteral vancomycin. She is also receiving IV dextrose and fentanyl for pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 39.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 471 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 83 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 2.8 mmol/L. Imaging pending includes a CT scan of the IR procedure.

Plan:
1. Continue treatment of the abdominal wall abscess with IV antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and further tailoring antibiotics based on abscess drainage results.
2. Follow abdominal exam and JP drain input.
3. Need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube integrity.
4. Vancomycin and zosyn for antibiotics.
5. Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level.
6. Glucose control in setting of infection.
7. Consider empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with IV flagyl.
8. Restart subcutaneous insulin at half dose and monitor fingerstick glucose levels every 6 hours.
9. Nutrition: Discuss with GI and start as soon as possible.
10. Continue to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
11. Follow up with renal recommendations and consider dialysis today.
12. Continue to guaiac stools and defer to GI regarding decisions to potentially scope for gastrointestinal bleeding.
13. Hold entecavir/tenofovir due to reluctance to use PEG right now.
14. Obtain accurate home medication list.
15. Hold SQH for now and monitor PTT if starting.
16. Assess peripheral lines and hemodialysis line.
17. Patient is to be communicated with regarding code status and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and presence of an abscess suggest a risk of infection. The ongoing treatment with antibiotics is aimed at addressing this concern.
2. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings indicate an abdominal wall abscess, which requires ongoing management and drainage.
3. Hepatitis B infection: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B infection, which can have long-term complications such as cirrhosis and liver failure.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and nonketotic hyperglycemia indicate a risk for DKA, especially in the setting of infection and stress.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stools raise concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly related to the PEG placement or other underlying conditions.
6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function, potentially due to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Liver failure: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and history of chronic Hepatitis B infection raise concern for liver failure, which can lead"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - HD early in afternoon.
   - IR procedure at 16:00 interupted HD
   - IR drained thick purulent fluid and placed drain
   - Hypoglycemic after IR procedure to 9 by fingerstick on returning to
   the floor. Pushed 25 g dextrose with recovery. Given juice.
   - Hepatology: Do not use G-tube. Continue antibiotic Rx. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   previously underestimated degree of liver failure. Could be stage IV.
   - Somnolent most of the day.
   - Occasional PVCs on telemetry.
   - WBC climbing - 23.9 > 38.4 > 39.2. Suspicion for C. diff. given
   diarrhea, also other infections: sepsis, abdominal wall. HD stable
   overnight and afebrile.
   - Some loose stool in the evening - partly dried on mat and not send
   for C. diff.
   - Started on empiric enteral vancomycin given no stool sent and WBC
   climbing.
   - Refused dailysis this a.m. (Renal would like to have done this this
   morning because she really had very little fluid off last session).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient presented with abdominal pain and malaise and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess.

The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to drain the abscess, resulting in the removal of thick purulent fluid and placement of a drain. After the procedure, the patient experienced hypoglycemia, which was addressed by administering dextrose and restarting subcutaneous insulin.

The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, indicating a possible infection or abscess. The gram stain of the abscess fluid showed gram-positive rods, gram-negative rods, and budding yeast. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, with plans to tailor the antibiotic regimen based on the abscess drainage results. Empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile infection is also being administered.

The patient's diabetes mellitus requires careful management, as evidenced by the hypoglycemic event after the IR procedure. Insulin therapy has been initiated, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is ongoing.

The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is scheduled for dialysis three times a week. She is currently refusing dial"

   Disposition :Transfer to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent admission for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to malnutrition. She was transferred from another hospital for suspected infection and fluid collection associated with the PEG. After drainage, evidence of polymicrobial infection was observed on gram stain.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Abdominal wall infection: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated, but she appears to be much better clinically after the IR drainage. However, she will need a gastrograffin study to further evaluate the situation, and the treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, checking for Clostridium difficile infection, starting oral metronidazole, and discontinuing stress dose steroids.
2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient requires hemodialysis per renal, but she refused it this morning.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient experienced an episode of hypoglycemia last night. Restart the subcutaneous insulin and discontinue the insulin gtt.
4. Other issues: These are being managed by the ICU team.

Overall, the patient's main medical complications include an abdominal wall infection, ESRD requiring dialysis, and hyperglycemia. The potential complications that can arise include worsening of the abdominal wall infection,"

   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall Abscess.  IR drained purulent fluid. Gram Stain with
   GPR, GNR, Yeast. Unclear if PEG tube integrity still intact. Patient
   improving clinically despite increasing white blood cell count.
   Hemodynamically stable. Discussed treating yeast with ID they recommend
   Micafungin if patient clinically decompensates, however may be from GI
   tract.
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube currently.
   - FU GI Recs
   - Follow abdominal exam/JP drain input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube.
   - Vanco/zosyn/micofungin for antibiotics.  Further tailoring
   antibiotics based on abscess drainage results.
   - Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Fungemia. Likely from GI tract as source. Continue treatment as
   above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above. White count
   increasing.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - IV flagyl for empiric treatment of C. Diff.
   .
   # DM.  Pt on Insulin gtt early yesterday. Hypoglycemic after IR
   procedure. Subcutaneous insulin restarted. AG closed.
   - Glargine at half dose and SSI, fingerstick Q6hrs
   - Nutrition as soon as possible, discuss with GI
   .
   # UTI. No Urine
   - Resend urine
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved. Alert and Oriented x 3. Minimal asterixis on
   exam.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - When taking PO start Lactulose.
   .
   # ESRD.  Usual HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R tunnelled line.
   - FU renal recs
   - Dialysis today.
   .
   # Anemia.  Concern for GIB at OSH.  Stools Guaiac positive but brown.
   HCT stable.
   - Continue to Guaiac stools
   - Defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope.
   .
   # Chronic hep B infection/cholangiopathy.  Bili slightly up above
   baseline.
   - Hold entecavir/tenofovir given reluctancy to use PEG right now.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO and nothing thru PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH for now (monitor PTT if starting)

Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise, and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic Hepatitis B infection, chronic kidney disease (ESRD), possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient has an existing abscess in the left abdomen, which has been drained but may require further treatment and monitoring for infection.
2. Fungemia: There is evidence of yeast in blood cultures, suggesting a possible fungal infection, likely originating from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is currently being treated with antifungal medication.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are not well controlled, requiring insulin therapy. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin dosages are necessary to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
5. Chronic kidney disease (ESRD): The patient has end-stage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition who presented with abdominal pain and malaise. She has been diagnosed with a nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess. The patient underwent an incision and drainage procedure, and gram stain results of the abscess fluid showed yeast. She has been started on antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Micafungin. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will require total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Other medical conditions include chronic hep B infection, anemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's current medications include insulin, subcutaneous heparin (SQH), and entecavir/tenofovir for Hepatitis B. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient has an existing abdominal wall abscess that was drained, but there is a concern about the integrity of the PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or fluid leakage from the abdomen is crucial.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, suggesting a possible fungemia. Close monitoring for any signs of systemic fungal infection is necessary.
3. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, which may require careful management of blood glucose levels, especially during infection and hospitalization.
4. Chronic hep B infection: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B infection, which may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and stool guaiac tests are important.
6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and requires regular dialysis sessions. Monitoring for any complications related to dialysis, such as infection or vascular access issues, is necessary.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition status needs to be addressed through appropriate nutrition support, such as TPN or enteral feeding once the PEG tube integrity is confirmed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions and potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition who was recently admitted for abdominal pain and malaise. She was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and there are concerns about an abdominal wall abscess. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments including PEG placement, hemodialysis, drainage of the abscess, and administration of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient has been diagnosed with an abdominal wall abscess, which can potentially lead to further infection and complications if not properly managed.
2. Fungemia: There is a concern for fungemia, likely originating from the GI tract. If left untreated, this can progress to systemic infection.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increasing white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, which may require careful management of her blood glucose levels, especially during periods of infection or stress.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and requires regular hemodialysis. This condition can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
6. Chronic Hepatitis B infection/cholangiopathy: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B infection, which can cause liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction.
7. Possible gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stools"
