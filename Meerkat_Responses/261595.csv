   Assessment and Plan
   77F w h/o CAD s/p CABG, CKD, EtOH use, and depression who initially was
   admitted with SOB and UTI and is now transferred due to altered mental
   status and total body rigidity.
   .
   # AMS/rigidity: Initial concern for seizures; however, pt noted to have
   some purposeful movement in spite of rigidity. Differential also
   includes infectious causes including meningitis/encephalitis, dystonic
   reaction to neuroleptic agents, neuroleptic malignant syndrome vs.
   serotonin syndrome although patient without fevers, CVA, seizures,
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Patient also hypertensive upon arrival,
   thus HTN emergency also remains on differential. Doubt EtOH withdrawal
   as she is outside the window for this. She had been getting ativan at
   OSH which could be contributing to current AMS. Doubt hypercarbia as
   ABG without elevated PaCO2.
   - Obtain noncontrast head CT.
   - LP if head CT negative for masses, hemorrhage.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis or herpes encephalitis for now
   with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. Hold on
   steroids for now.
   - Treat for possible dystonic reaction with standing IV benztropine and
   benadryl.
   - Hold off on dantrolene for treatment of NMS for now. If CKs rise, has
   fevers, is more rigid, then will consider starting dantrolene.
   - Check UA to r/o myoglobinuria.
   - Appreciate neurology following.
   - EEG tomorrow to r/o seizures.
   - Check TSH (was wnl a few days ago at OSH).
   - Check urine, serum tox.
   - Goal SBPs < 180. Will start standing IV metoprolol (on toprol 100 mg
   daily at home) to avoid rebound tachycardia associated with hydralazine
   as pt is already tachycardic.
   - Avoid neuroleptic agents, benzodiazepenes.
   .
   #) Tachycardia - Patient appears very dry on examination, may be in
   some degree of pain or discomfort, and had been receiving po clonidine
   at OSH for BP control that can cause rebound tachycardia.
   - IVFs with LR @ 150 cc/hr for now.
   - Avoid hydralazine given rebound tachycardia effect.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   .
   #) Elevated CK - In setting of significant amount of rigidity on exam.
   Cr was initially elevated at OSH, but has improved after treatment of
   UTI.
   - Monitor CK.
   - Check UA.
   - Monitor urine output.
   - IVFs as above.
   .
   #) HTN - With known prior h/o HTN and appears to have been difficult to
   control at OSH. As above, HTN emergency is a diagnostic consideration,
   although would have expected some improvement in MS with better control
   of BPs.
   - Standing IV metoprolol 5 mg q6h as above.
   .
   #) Elevated AST/ALT
 LDH also elevated, AlkPhos/bili wnl. Likely
   muscle source given elevated CK. AST was also elevated at OSH
   supporting h/o EtOH use. Will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) CAD s/p CABG - Hold on home po meds for now given NPO status. No
   clear evidence of ischemia on EKG. Continue monitoring on telemetry.
   Standing IV bblocker as above. Add on cardiac enzymes, recheck EKG in
   am.
   .
   #) Depression - Holding home seroquel.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression.
- The patient was initially admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and urinary tract infection (UTI), and is now transferred due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.
- She is currently intubated for airway protection, and various medications have been started or adjusted, including metoprolol, hydralazine, dantrolene, and sedatives.
- The patient's vital signs include a fever downtrending, elevated CK level, tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation.
- Physical examination reveals diaphoresis, dry and erythematous mouth, tachycardia, limited lung exam due to intubation, decreased bowel sounds, no lower extremity edema, warm skin, and increased muscle tone with rigidity.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels.
- The assessment and plan include considering various potential causes for the patient's altered mental status and rigidity, such as seizures, infectious causes, dystonic reaction, neurole"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F w h/o CAD s/p CABG, CKD, EtOH use, and depression, who initially
   was admitted with SOB and UTI and is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] due to
   altered mental status and total body rigidity.
   .
   # AMS/rigidity: likely [**12-27**] neuroleptic malignant syndrome, though ddx
   includes new brain mass. Per daughter, pt had some rigidity before
   given haldol ([**5-8**]). Not likely to be seizure, EtOH withdrawal or
   infection. Pt still w episodic tachycardia, hypertension, fevers. CK
   downtrending.
   - copious hydration to keep UOP > 50, LR vs NS
   - continue dantrolene
   - standing tylenol, cooling blanket for fever
   - metoprolol/hydralazine for tachycardia/HTN (goal < 160)
   - continue to monitor CK, urine myoglobin
   - consider paralysis, if worsening
   - f/u neuro recs
   - avoid neuroleptics/anticholinergics
   - continue intubation for airway support
   # HTN: Prior h/o HTN, currently in the setting of NMS.
   - Standing IV metoprolol 5 mg q6h as above.
   - PRN hydralazine
   # Anemia: likely dilutional in the setting of anemia of chronic disease
   (Hct 33 on admission, down to 25).
   - monitor daily Hct
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   # Elevated AST/ALT: LDH also elevated, AlkPhos/bili wnl. Likely muscle
   source given elevated CK. AST was also elevated at OSH supporting h/o
   EtOH use. Will continue to monitor.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:  Hold on home po meds for now given NPO status. No
   clear evidence of ischemia on EKG. CE negative x 3.
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry.
   - Standing IV bblocker as above.
   .
   # Depression:
   - holding home seroquel.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, CKD, EtOH use, and depression. She was initially admitted with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection. She is now in the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/33-54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and troponin T levels, while other parameters are within normal limits. The assessment includes altered mental status likely due to neuroleptic malignant syndrome, with possible new brain mass as a differential diagnosis. The plan includes hydration, dantrolene administration, monitoring of CK and urine myoglobin, consideration of paralysis if worsening, follow-up with neurology recommendations, avoidance of neuroleptics/anticholinergics, continuation of intubation for airway support, and weaning of propofol daily to see if rigidity has resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and tachycardia, which may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment would be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with an altered mental status, hypertension, respiratory failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and medications for his conditions. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs show a fever of 101.5°F, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 130/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The chest X-ray reveals new subtle lower lobe infiltrates. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, sedatives, and other medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a fever and new bibasilar infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which suggests a possible VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected properly.

3. Hypotension: Despite the elevated blood pressure reading, the patient's blood pressure is relatively low considering the high heart rate. This may indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, worsening secretions, and new lower lobe infiltrates suggestive of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction. An imaging study reveals a frontal lobe hypodensity, although its clinical significance is unclear. The patient is being treated with dantrolene for suspected neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), antibiotics for VAP, and antihypertensive medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's new fever, elevated white blood cell count, and bibasilar infiltrates indicate a possible case of VAP. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory function and systemic infection.
2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient's altered mental status, rigidity, and treatment with dantrolene suggest a possible diagnosis of NMS. NMS is a life-threatening neurological disorder typically associated with the use of antipsychotic medications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate persistent hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or organ damage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical"

   was admitted with SOB and UTI and is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] due to
   altered mental status and total body rigidity.
   # AMS/rigidity: Off sedation patient continues to be minimally
   responsive without purposeful movement.  Likely [**12-27**] neuroleptic
   malignant syndrome, dantrolene was stopped yesterday. CK now elevated
   after dantrolene was stopped. Too far out for EtOH withdrawal. Pt still
   w episodic tachycardia, hypertension, fevers (see infection work-up as
   below).
   - hydration to keep UOP > 50, LR vs NS
   - restart dantrolene
   - standing tylenol
   - continue to monitor CK
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u tox recs
   - avoid neuroleptics/anticholinergics
   - consider MRI brain
   # Fever, respiratory distress: Fever curve down trending. Sputum so far
   growing yeast.
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn ([**5-15**] - )
   - check bl cx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - continue intubation for airway support, on PS 5/5, FiO2 to 30%, try
   SBT
   - holding sedation
   - PICC placement for antibiotics
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved, however will have to monitor with restarting
   Dantrolene (only perpared in free water).
   # HTN: Improving. Prior h/o HTN, currently in the setting of NMS.
   - metoprolol to 25 TID
   - hydralazine PRN
   # Anemia: Stable.
   - monitor daily Hct
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   # Elevated AST/ALT: LDH also elevated, AlkPhos/bili wnl. Likely muscle
   source given elevated CK. AST was also elevated at OSH supporting h/o
   EtOH use.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression. She was initially admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and urinary tract infection (UTI), and is now transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, fever, respiratory distress, hyponatremia, hypertension, anemia, elevated AST/ALT, and possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's presentation with altered mental status, fever, autonomic instability (episodic tachycardia and hypertension), and muscle rigidity suggests NMS. Immediate treatment with dantrolene should be initiated.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The presence of fever and yeast in the sputum culture raises concern for VAP. Antibiotics should be adjusted accordingly.
3. Delirium: Altered mental status can be associated with delirium, which is common in critically ill patients. It is important to assess for other potential causes of delirium and provide appropriate interventions.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which need to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented initially with shortness of breath (SOB) and urinary tract infection (UTI), and was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note. These include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and is experiencing respiratory distress, which is difficult to wean from intubation. There is a new infection suspected, possibly VAP, as evidenced by fever and the growth of yeast in sputum culture.

2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient shows signs of altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic instability (episodic tachycardia and hypertension). These symptoms are consistent with NMS, especially considering the recent administration of haloperidol. The patient also has an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level after stopping dantrolene, which is used to treat NMS.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a prior history of hypertension and is currently experiencing elevated blood pressure in the setting of NMS.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has decreased from 33 on admission to 25. This could be due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression. She was initially admitted with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and then transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory distress, and difficulty weaning from intubation, likely in the setting of new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She has been started on vancomycin and Zosyn.

She also has altered mental status/rigidity, likely neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), although differential diagnosis includes brain mass/stroke. Her creatine kinase (CK) levels are trending down and she is improving.

She has a history of hypertension (HTN) and is currently hypertensive in the setting of NMS. She has been placed on metoprolol and hydralazine as needed.

She also has anemia, likely dilutional in the setting of anemia of chronic disease (Hct 33 on admission, down to 25). Her liver enzymes AST/ALT are elevated, along with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting a muscle source given the elevated CK. AST was also elevated at outside hospital (OSH), supporting a history of alcohol use."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated, intubated for

   SBT and extubation trial.
    MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Resume dantrolene.  Monitor
   CPK.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- stable.  Remains removed.  Frontal hypodensity
   may be contributing to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP.  Monitor.  Continue empirical antimicrobials -->
   vanco/zosyn.
   HYPONATREMIA -- resolved.  Attributed to dantrolene.  Monitor Na.
   HTN
 continue metoprolol
   CNS -- Frontal lobe hypodensity, suspect prior CVA, but unclear as to
   timing.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. They have been sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's rigidity has improved since admission, but they are still experiencing muscular rigidity attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Dantrolene has been resumed to manage NMS, and CPK levels will be monitored.

The patient's mental status is stable, and they remain on sedation. Frontal hypodensity may contribute to their withdrawn state, although the timing of the CNS lesion is unclear. The patient has pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and will continue on empirical antimicrobials including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Hypotonicity has resolved, which was likely due to dantrolene. Blood pressure remains high, and metoprolol will be continued. The patient's nutritional support is on hold, and there are concerns about potential abuse.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 126/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 30% and a respiratory system compliance of 48.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has respiratory failure and is being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient also exhibits muscular rigidity, which is attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Dantrolene has been resumed to manage this condition and monitor CPK levels. The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to a frontal lobe hypodensity that may be contributing to a withdrawn state. The timing of the CNS lesion is unclear. Hypertension is present and metoprolol will be continued. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if there are complications with the mechanical ventilation or pneumonia. There is also a risk of further neurological decline if the frontal lobe hypodensity progresses. The muscular rigidity and NMS could lead to complications such as rhabdomyolysis or renal failure if not managed properly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), s/p coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression. She was initially admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is now in the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/55 to 170/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient is likely experiencing NMS, which is characterized by altered mental status, fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Dantrolene was restarted due to the elevated CK levels.
2. Infection: The patient has an active infection, as indicated by the presence of fever and yeast growth in the sputum. She is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for infection control.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient had resolved hyponatremia but will need to be monitored when restarting dant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and total body rigidity. She has been diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and is currently being treated with dantrolene. The patient's condition has improved clinically, with improved responsiveness and ability to initiate purposeful movement. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if not corrected promptly.

2. Hypertension: The patient is experiencing high blood pressure, which may be related to NMS or underlying conditions such as CAD. This needs to be managed to prevent complications like stroke or heart attack.

3. RUE Cellulitis: The patient has developed erythema on her right upper extremity (RUE), which could indicate cellulitis. If left untreated, it could progress and lead to more serious infections.

4. Thrombophlebitis: Although less likely given the absence of recent lines in the affected area, thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein due to a blood clot) is a possibility and should be considered.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): While DVT is unlikely given the absence of asymmetry in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, depression, and previous CABG surgery.
- She was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and then transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.
- The patient has been diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and has been treated with dantrolene.
- She is extubated and responsive, able to move all four extremities.
- The patient's fever, respiratory distress, and hyponatremia have improved.
- There is a concern for potential worsening of hyponatremia due to free water administration with dantrolene.
- The patient has hypertension and anemia, which are being monitored.
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and LDH levels are present, likely due to muscle injury. These are trending down.
- The patient has cellulitis on her right upper extremity (RUE) and is being covered with vancomycin.
- Home medications for CAD s/p CABG are held due to NPO status.
- Depression is being managed by holding home seroquel.

The patient's condition has worsened, leading to her transfer to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C
- Heart rate: 86 bpm
- Blood pressure: 148/55 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

The patient's neurologic status has improved, and she is responsive with the ability to move all four extremities. However, she still experiences episodic tachycardia, hypertension, and fevers. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Her liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are also elevated, which may be related to her history of alcohol use. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), likely secondary to antipsychotic medication use. Dantrolene has been restarted due to an upward trend in creatine kinase (CK) levels. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated, intubated for
   airway protection.  Sedatives decreased.  Tolerating SBT --> extubation
   trial now.
   MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Improved on dantrolene -->
   ?necessary duration of treatment.  Monitor CPK.  Avoid neuroleptics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.  Frontal hypodensity may have
   contributed to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP.  Monitor.  Continue empirical antimicrobials -->
   vanco/zosyn to complete course.
   HYPONATREMIA -- resolved.  Attributed to dantrolene.  Monitor Na.
   HTN
 continue metoprolol
   CNS -- Frontal lobe hypodensity, suspect prior CVA, but unclear as to
   timing.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown some improvement as they are more awake and interactive this morning, tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and demonstrating less motor muscle rigidity. However, fleeting neurologic motor findings are still present.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above. They have no known drug allergies and received doses of antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin) on 05/17/2146.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 67-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/54 mmHg to 170/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 13-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including mechanical ventilation, sedation, dantrolene, and empirical antimicrobials for pneumonia (VAP). They also have an arterial line, central venous line, and urinary catheter in place.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 321 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 137 mg/dL, and sodium level of 137 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, troponin-T, ALT, AST, lactate, LDH, and decreased levels of calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, muscular rigidity attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), altered mental status possibly due to a frontal lobe hypodensity, pneumonia (VAP), hypotension, and hypertension. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated, intubated for
   airway protection.  Sedatives decreased.  Toerating SBT --> extubation
   trial now.
   MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Improved on dantrolene -->
   ?necessary duration of treatment.  Monitor CPK.  Avoid neuroleptics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.  Frontal hypodensity may have
   contributed to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP.  Monitor.  Continue empirical antimicrobials -->
   vanco/zosyn to complete course.
   HYPONATREMIA -- resolved.  Attributed to dantrolene.  Monitor Na.
   HTN
 continue metoprolol
   CNS -- Frontal lobe hypodensity, suspect prior CVA, but unclear as to
   timing.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is being treated for pneumonia, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient already has pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial in preventing or managing this complication.

2. Muscle rigidity: The patient exhibited muscle rigidity, which was attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). This condition can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with dantrolene. Monitoring CPK levels and avoiding neuroleptics are important in managing this complication.

3. Altered mental status: The patient had an altered mental status, which has improved but may still require close monitoring. The frontal lobe hypodensity suggests a possible prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), although the timing is unclear. Continued neurological monitoring will be necessary.

4. Hypotension and hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. Monitoring and adjusting medications like metoprolol will be important to maintain stable blood pressure levels.

5. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional support is currently on hold. Nutritional management will be essential for the patient's recovery, so close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure and was intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, with increased wakefulness and interaction. They are tolerating spontaneous breathing trials and demonstrating less motor muscle rigidity. However, they still exhibit fleeting neurologic motor findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate persistent hypertension, which may require further management and optimization of medications.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient experienced tachycardia and hypertension, accompanied by evolving respiratory distress. This suggests a possible cardiac issue, such as cardiac ischemia, which needs to be evaluated and monitored.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory distress and inspiratory crackles on lung exam suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications, including VAP, hypertension, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, and hyperglycemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was initially admitted for shortness of breath and urinary tract infection and is now in the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status (likely neuroleptic malignant syndrome), atrial flutter, hypodensity in the right frontal lobe on head CT (old infarct or underlying mass), pneumonia, hypertension, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could lead to complications such as falls, self-harm, or inability to protect her airway, which may require intubation.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter increases the risk of stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and potential complications related to cardioversion if performed.
3. Hypodensity in the Right Frontal Lobe: The presence of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe could indicate an old infarct or underlying mass, which may cause neurological symptoms and potential complications if the mass is malignant or progresses.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia could lead to respiratory distress, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction if not properly managed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), ethanol use, and depression. She was initially admitted for shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and is now in the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. The patient has been treated with various medications, including dantrolene for suspected neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). She also has episodes of tachycardia, hypertension, and fever, which have improved. The patient's condition includes altered mental status, fever, respiratory distress, hyponatremia, hypertension, anemia, elevated AST/ALT, and right upper extremity (RUE) cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, total body rigidity, episodic tachycardia, hypertension, and fever are consistent with NMS. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are crucial to prevent complications associated with NMS, such as autonomic instability, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and positive yeast growth in the sputum suggests a respiratory infection. This requires continued antibiotic therapy to prevent worsening of the infection and potential spread to other organs.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation prior to PICC placement, which did not respond to metoprolol and later converted to atrial flutter. This condition may lead to hemodynamic instability, increased risk of thromboembolic events, and potential complications related to the use of anticoagulant medications.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently elevated (SBP 160s), indicating hypertension. If left untreated, hypertension can lead to end-organ damage, including cardiovascular events, renal dysfunction, and retinopathy.

3. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as medication effects, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying medical conditions. This condition increases the risk of delirium, falls, and inadequate self-care.

4. Possible medication errors: The progress note mentions the administration of multiple medications, including amiodarone, diltiazem, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and digoxin. There is a risk of medication errors, such as incorrect dosages or timing, which can result in adverse drug reactions or treatment failures.

5. Risk of infection: The patient is in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. This increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), or catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

6. Fluid balance disturbance: The flowsheet data shows an imbalance"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- improving s/p extubation.
   MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Improved on dantrolene -->
   ?necessary duration of treatment.  Monitor CPK.  Avoid neuroleptics.
   Improved.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.  Frontal hypodensity may have
   contributed to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).
   A-FIB -- controlled on amioderone and digoxin.  Monitor digoxin
   level.   For Cardiology evaluation (EP service) --> ?cardioversion.
   Check echo to assess for clot.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K > 4.0 while on Digoxin.
   RUE SWELLING -- indurated, possible infiltration of peripheral iv.
   Plan ultrasound to assess for clot.  Local care (arm elevation, etc)

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of tachycardia. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation/flutter throughout the evening and night, but eventually controlled with amiodarone. The patient remains on amiodarone drip. Cardiology (EP) service consulted, and the patient is awaiting further evaluation. The patient was extubated successfully and is no longer experiencing respiratory distress, requiring only 2 L NP. Muscular rigidity improved, and the patient is off dantrolene. The patient self-removed an arterial line without incident and has a stronger voice today.

Medical History:
The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/18/2146 at 06:00 AM and Vancomycin on 05/18/2146 at 09:06 AM. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone at a rate of 0.5 mg/min. Other ICU medications include diltiazem, metoprolol, lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions above.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears well-nourished, without acute distress or signs of being overweight, thin, anxious, diaphoretic, or frail-appe"

   level.   For Cardiology evaluation (EP service) --> ?cardioversion.
   Check echo to assess for clot.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K > 4.0 while on Digoxin.
   RUE SWELLING -- indurated, possible infiltration of peripheral iv.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has since improved after extubation. Monitoring is required to ensure continued improvement.

2. Muscular Rigidity: The patient had muscular rigidity attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). This condition has improved with the use of dantrolene, but the necessary duration of treatment needs to be determined. Regular monitoring of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels should be done, and the use of neuroleptics should be avoided.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient had an altered mental status, which has much improved. Frontal hypodensity may have contributed to the withdrawn state, but the timing of the CNS lesion is unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (A-FIB): The patient experienced atrial fibrillation, which has been controlled with amiodarone and digoxin. Monitoring of digoxin levels is necessary, and a cardiology evaluation, including the possibility of cardioversion, should be considered. An echocardiogram should also be performed to assess for any clot formation.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia, which has been repleted to a potassium level greater than 4.0 while on digoxin."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression. She was initially admitted with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI), and then transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient initially presented with altered mental status and total body rigidity. It was suspected to be neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) from Haldol received in an outside facility. Responsiveness improved with the resolution of purposeful movement off sedation and treatment with dantrolene. The plan is to keep the patient hydrated, avoid neuroleptics/anticholinergics, and consider restarting dantrolene if the patient's condition worsens or creatine kinase (CPK) levels trend up.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient is stable and asymptomatic with normal troponin levels. Cardioversion with conscious sedation is planned today or tomorrow morning. Anticoagulation with heparin and rate control with amiodarone drip and diltiazem are ongoing.

3. Hypodensity right frontal lobe on Head CT: This could be an old infarct or underlying mass. Neurology follow-up is recommended."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol use, and depression. She was admitted initially for shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and then transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), altered mental status (AMS), hypodensity right frontal lobe on head CT (old infarct vs. underlying mass), fever and respiratory distress presumed pneumonia, anemia, elevated AST/ALT levels, and a right upper extremity (RUE) thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is at risk of developing complications associated with AFib such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's high blood pressure puts her at risk for complications such as hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage.
3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's altered mental status may lead to complications like falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty in maintaining adequate nutrition and hydration.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of nonadherence to warfarin therapy. He presented with fever, chills, and chest pain, and was found to have an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial ischemia. The patient underwent cardioversion with 200J and was converted from atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. However, he experienced a brief episode of atrial fibrillation afterward.

The patient is currently on heparin and amiodarone drips, with plans to go home on aspirin instead of warfarin due to adherence concerns. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcer prevention and deep vein thrombosis prevention. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 80s and blood pressure within normal limits. His oxygen saturation remains at 98% on room air.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. His creatinine levels are within normal range, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose levels are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels appear to be within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals worsening cellulitis on his left wrist, with blisters and pain. The patient is not cooperative with hot pack treatment. Restraints have been ordered to prevent the patient from removing the hot pack"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was initially admitted to the outside hospital with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient has multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, altered mental status (not delirium), and right upper extremity thrombosis. She also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), ethanol use, and depression.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 187/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her current weight is 76 kg, and her height is 64 inches.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.3 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, platelet count of 406 thousand/mm³, blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 21 mEq/L, glucose of 91 mg/dL, and serum troponin T of less than 0.01 ng/mL.

Radiology images show hypodensity in the right frontal lobe on head CT, suggestive of an old infarct or underlying mass.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed pneumonia, monitoring for any signs of delirium, and considering a noncontrast head CT with thin cuts if an MRI is not possible. She will also receive hydration to keep urine output greater than 50 mL in the next 24 hours and will be monitored closely for any changes in mental status or vital signs."

   77F w h/o CAD s/p CABG, CKD, EtOH use, depression, who initially was
   admitted to OSH with SOB and UTI and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] due to
   altered mental status and total body rigidity.
   # AMS/rigidity: likely [**12-27**] NMS from Halidol received in outside
   facility.  Improved responsiveness with resolution of purposeful
   movement after rx with dantrolene.  Also concerned for sundowning.
   - plan to hold dantrolene per tox recs given patient
s continued
   clinical improvement and decreased CPK, will consider restarting if pts
   condition worsens or CPKs trend up
   - avoid neuroleptics/anticholinergics: for agitation consider judicious
   use of ativan
   - pt also develops AMS and agitation with morphine, avoid when possible
   # Atrial Flutter: Cardioverted, in sinus rhythm since cardioversion.
   Anticoagulated, amiodarone drip transitioned to oral meds.
   -anticoagulation with heparin, should be transitioned to coumadin upon
   discharge (pending MRI of head results)
   -rate control with amiodarone
   -etiology unknown: blood cx , UA and cx., sputum cx to r/o infection;
   hx of CAD s/p CABG; TFT wnl
   # hypodensity right frontal lobe on Head CT: old infarct vs. underlying
   mass.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - if pt. unable to have MRI ([**12-27**] b/l total knee replacement and screws
   in ankles), consider noncontrast head CT with thin cuts
   # Fever, respiratory distress [**12-27**] presumed pneumonia: Pt extubated
   without complication, afebrile aith stable WBC
   - Sputum so far growing yeast.
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn ([**5-15**] - ) via picc
   - CXR show interval improvement in LLL density
   - cxs continue show no growth
   # HTN: Patient hypertensive to 211 today: responded to hydralazine and
   labetolol, no sx. of end organ damage
   - hx. Of complicated HTN on multiple home meds: restart valsartan,
   imdur, amlodiple.  Will hold metoprolol for now [**12-27**] potential drug
   interaction with amiodarone
   - hydralazine PRN
   # Anemia: Stable.
   - monitor daily Hct
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   # CAD s/p CABG:  stable, restart home medications
   .
   # RUE thrombosis: Doppler show thrombosis in brachialcephalic vein not
   extending to deep veins
   -on heparin for A. flutter
   -cold packs to affected area
   #Left wrist cellulitis: erythema and pain of Left wrist developping in

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She was initially admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and urinary tract infection (UTI) and later transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and total body rigidity.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient had episodes of atrial flutter, which were successfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm. She is being anticoagulated with heparin and will transition to oral medications upon discharge. Rate control is being achieved with amiodarone.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, but she responded well to hydralazine and labetalol without any symptoms of end-organ damage. Her home medications for hypertension will be restarted, and metoprolol will be held due to potential drug interactions with amiodarone.

3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient initially presented with AMS and total body rigidity, which was likely neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) caused by haloperidol received in an outside facility. Responsiveness improved after treatment with dantrolene, and the patient may consider restarting dantrolene if her condition worsens or creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels trend upwards. Neuroleptics and anticholin"

   MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Improved now off dantrolene.
   Avoid neuroleptics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.  Frontal hypodensity may have
   contributed to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).  Suspect
   in part ICU psychosis.
   A-FIB -- Stable s/p cardioversion, and controlled on amioderone.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K > 4.0.
   RUE SWELLING -- Superficial clot identified by US.  Local care (arm
   elevation, etc)
   Left WRIST CELLULITSI
attributed to peripheral iv.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP.  Monitor.  Continue empirical antimicrobials -->
   vanco/zosyn to complete course.
   HYPONATREMIA -- resolved.  Attributed to dantrolene.  Monitor Na.
   HTN
 continue metoprolol prn.
   CNS -- Frontal lobe hypodensity, suspect prior CVA, but unclear as to

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent cardioversion and remains in NRS. They are currently on heparin gtt and amiodarone. The patient's mental status has improved but they remain disoriented. The patient demonstrates Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern during sleep and has a reversal of sleep-wake cycle. The patient is obese and not well-nourished. No acute distress is noted. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 166/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on respiratory support but not requiring supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, and normal electrolyte levels except for low potassium of 2.0 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient has a low potassium level which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of pneumonia (VAP) and left wrist cellulitis, both of which require prompt treatment.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a positive fluid balance indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   A-FLUTTER/A-FIB
   MUSCULAR RIGIDITY -- attributed to NMS.  Improved now off dantrolene.
   Avoid neuroleptics.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.  Frontal hypodensity may have
   contributed to withdrawn state (unclear timing of CNS lesion).  Suspect
   in part ICU psychosis.
   A-FIB -- Stable s/p cardioversion, and controlled on amioderone.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K > 4.0.
   RUE SWELLING -- Superficial clot identified by US.  Local care (arm
   elevation, etc)
   Left WRIST CELLULITSI
attributed to peripheral iv.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP.  Monitor.  Continue empirical antimicrobials -->
   vanco/zosyn to complete course.
   HYPONATREMIA -- resolved.  Attributed to dantrolene.  Monitor Na.
   HTN
 continue metoprolol prn.
   CNS -- Frontal lobe hypodensity, suspect prior CVA, but unclear as to
   timing.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold.  Speech & Swallow evaluation.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   need TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with atrial fibrillation (A-fibrillation).
- The patient underwent cardioversion and remains in NRS (presumably normal sinus rhythm).
- The patient's mental status has improved, although they are still disoriented.
- The patient demonstrates Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern during sleep and a reversal of the sleep-wake cycle.
- The patient is on heparin gtt (presumably for anticoagulation).
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP) and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- The patient has hypokalemia, which has been repleted.
- The patient has right upper extremity swelling, attributed to a superficial clot identified by ultrasound.
- The patient has left wrist cellulitis, likely due to peripheral IV access.
- The patient had muscular rigidity attributed to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), but this has improved now that they are off dantrolene.
- The patient had altered mental status, which has much improved.
- The patient remains hypertensive and will continue metoprolol as needed.
- The patient has frontal lobe hypodensity, suspected prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but unclear as to timing.
- The patient's nutritional support is on hold, and a speech and swallow evaluation is needed.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's diagnosis of VAP indicates a potential complication of their critical condition. It is important to monitor and continue empirical antimicrobials to complete the course.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Clot formation: The identification of a superficial clot in the right upper extremity suggests a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis measures, such as systemic anticoagulation with heparin, should be continued.
4. Cellulitis: The presence of left wrist cellulitis indicates a localized infection. It is important to manage this infection appropriately to prevent further complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
6. Frontal lobe hypodensity: The suspected prior CVA may have contributed to the patient's altered mental status. Monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the extent of any neurological damage.
7. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, such as dry mouth, could indicate nausea or vomiting. It is important to assess and manage these symptoms to ensure patient comfort and prevent dehydration.
8. Fatigue: The patient's constitutional symptoms include fatigue. It is important to monitor for signs of increased fatigue or weakness, which may"
