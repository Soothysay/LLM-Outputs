   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the
   large amount of ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious
   secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.
   Other differential diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in
   V2-4 but 3 sets of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given
   hypoxia resolved now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from
   admission and low grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting
   of distress which was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or
   fluid overload.  WBC trending down.  Infection- urine culture this
   admission was negative. Although CXR does not suggest infection,
   patient w/rhoncorous breath sounds b/l and Hx and sputum gram stain
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis.
   Decreased tidal volume, RR.  Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased.  Difficult b/c propofol goals for MICU team and neuro are
   different (neuro using as an antiepileptic medicine vs for sedation for
   intubation)
   -NSS bolus PRN (pt w/out Hx of CHF)
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
 discuss treatment goals
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: start tube feeds.  mIVF, monitor lytes, replete as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, presenting with respiratory distress. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. An EEG is ongoing. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, unaware, ranitidine, heparin sodium, and propofol. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/43 to 129/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's neurological status is unresponsive with sluggish pupils.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to aspiration pneumonia secondary to excessive sedation from the large amount of Ativan received within 5 hours. Other differential diagnoses include acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and infection.
2. Ventilator dependence: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to high levels of propofol desired by the neuro team. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis, and tidal volume and respiratory rate need to be adjusted accordingly.
3. Status epilepticus: The cause of the status epilepticus is unknown, and the medications are being adjusted to control seizures. Possible precipitants include infection,"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had respiratory
   distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx. Other differential
   diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in V2-4 but first set
   of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given hypoxia resolved
   now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from admission and low
   grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting of distress which
   was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or fluid overload.
   -AMI- unlikely but continue ROMI and monitor on tele.
   -PE- check CTA chest for PE. If it was positive, will have to speak
   with neurology regarding whether he can be systemically anticoagulated
   given his stroke history.
   -infection- urine culture this admission was negative. CXR does not
   suggest infection. Send BCx, sputum culture, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suctions aggressively
   .
   # ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG is good. Decreased FIO2.  After
   imaging studies today, consider changing to pressure support from AC
   ventilation.
   .
   # status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   -suboptimal medications- per neurology recs continue keppra 2000mg IV
   q12hr, depakote 500mg IV q8hr, trileptal 600mg PO per NGT [**Hospital1 7**]
   -? new neurologic event- check non-contrast head CT
   .
   # EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Continue to cycle enzymes.
   First set negative. Has risk factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   -Discuss with neurology whether a higher dose asa can be used.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, presenting with respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and invasive ventilation in the ICU. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 55%. His blood pressure is currently stable at 118/43 mmHg, heart rate is within normal range at 86 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient has a history of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use. He has been receiving propofol infusion for sedation, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient's neurologic examination shows sluggish but equal and reactive pupils, no focal deficits, and he is unresponsive to commands. His extremities are absent on the right side and decreased on the left side. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.6, elevated troponin T levels, and mildly decreased platelet count. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 61, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 102.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a"

   hypoxemic, intubated for airway protection and tx to ICU for management
   1. Resp Distress: unclear what the initial precipitants for this were
   based on noteds in chart, it seems that he may have been having
   recurrent seizure and was getting high dose Ativan. DDx could be
   oversedation and choking on own secretions/aspiration, PE, cardiac
   ischemia. At this point we have stable ECG, cycle enzymes, check CTA to
   look for PE, he is on AC, after he finisihes his imaging m ay be able
   to switch to PSV but currently maintain on full ventilatory support
   2. Leukocytosis: stress response with recurrent SZ possible but need to
   pan culture, no empiric ABX at present
   3. Refractory SZ: now that he has NGT can get his trileptal in addition
   to IV Depakote. Would gte head CT - no con before CTA whiole he is on
   round trip.  Continuous EEG, close Neuro follow up.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident) and refractory seizures. The patient was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and management of his condition.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced respiratory arrest and was intubated for airway protection. He is currently on invasive ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 102, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been addressed with fluid resuscitation as it was found to be responsive to fluids.

3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which have been refractory to treatment. He is currently on multiple anti-seizure medications including Keppra and Trileptal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with refractory seizures and respiratory failure. The patient was found in status epilepticus and subsequently intubated for respiratory arrest. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been transferred to the SICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of medications like propofol can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach.
4. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their own airway increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
5. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.
6. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of refractory seizures increases the risk of further seizure activity.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's underlying respiratory failure and the use of invasive ventilation increase the risk of additional respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated lung injury.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CVA and refractory seizures. He was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and management of seizures. The patient had respiratory arrest and was intubated. He has been on invasive ventilation, propofol sedation, and continuous EEG monitoring. His condition includes respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, and left lower lobe atelectasis. The workup for pulmonary embolism and cardiac ischemia was negative. He is also experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, and refractory seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and refractory seizures put him at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of his ventilation parameters are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The presence of aspiration pneumonia and leukocytosis indicates a potential infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies will be necessary to identify and treat any infectious complications promptly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, should be implemented to prevent this complication.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of VAP. Implementing strict infection control measures, including chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse and elevation of the head"

   57 yr old man with CVA and refractory seizures was on Neuro where he
   had recurrent seizures, resp distress, intubated for airway protection
   and tx to ICU for management
   1. Resp Distress: aspiration PNA and atelectasis in the setting of
   refractory seizures and altered mental status. Work up for PE and
   cardiac ischemia negative. Vanco Unasyn, follow up sputum CX. Is on AC
   is light of heavy sedation, will try for PSV when can wean propafol.
   He does have a Pao2 lower than one might expect given relative small
   size of [**Name (NI) 3634**] infiltrate. It could explain some shunt but we will up his
   PEEP as he may be more atelectatic than we appreciate.
   2. Hypotension: fluid responsive
 occureed in setting of hypovolemia
   and high doses of propafol. Post IVF he now has beeter UOP. Will bolus
   prn, and cover empirically for asp PNA.
   2. Leukocytosis: resolving, likely stress response with recurrent SZ
   possible but need to pan culture, no empiric ABX at present
   3. Refractory SZ: uptitrate keppra, trileptal, Neuro team has been
   increasing propafol in an effort to achieve burst suppression and post
   IVF he has tolerating this AM but will need ongoing discussionas
   alternative AED may be needed. On   Continuous EEG, close Neuro follow

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man admitted to the ICU with refractory seizures and respiratory failure. He had recurrent seizures, respiratory distress, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated with propofol. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and atelectasis due to refractory seizures and altered mental status. There is also a concern for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's PaO2 is lower than expected for the size of the infiltrate, indicating potential shunt, and the PEEP may need to be increased.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension that was fluid-responsive, likely due to hypovolemia and high doses of propofol. Intravenous fluids have been administered, and the patient's urine output has improved.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is resolving and may be a stress response related to recurrent seizures. Culturing should be planned, and no empirical antibiotic therapy is currently being given.

4. Refractory seizures: The patient has refractory seizures, and the dosage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as keppra and trileptal needs to be increased. Continuous EEG monitoring and close neurological follow-up are required.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the
   large amount of ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious
   secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.
   Other differential diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in
   V2-4 but 3 sets of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given
   hypoxia resolved now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from
   admission and low grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting
   of distress which was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or
   fluid overload.  WBC trending down.  Infection- urine culture this
   admission was negative. Although CXR does not suggest infection,
   patient w/rhoncorous breath sounds b/l and Hx and sputum gram stain
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis.
   Decreased tidal volume, RR.  Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased.  Difficult b/c propofol goals for MICU team and neuro are
   different (neuro using as an antiepileptic medicine vs for sedation for
   intubation)
   -NSS bolus PRN (pt w/out Hx of CHF)
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
 discuss treatment goals
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory distress, ventilator dependence, status epilepticus, hypotension, EKG changes, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke. The patient's current medications include Depakote, propofol, ranitidine (prophylaxis), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient is also on tube feeds and has received IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient most likely experienced respiratory distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from a large amount of ativan received in 5 hours. Other differential diagnoses include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and infection. The patient has copious secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Ventilator dependence: The patient is dependent on the ventilator due to high levels of propofol desired by the neuro team. This has resulted in respiratory alkalosis, decreased tidal volume, and reduced respiratory rate. The ventilator settings need to be adjusted accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased briefly on am of [**10-18**].  Propofol increased thereafter for
   better seizure control.  Received 500 cc bolus x 3 overnight [**10-18**]
   [**10-19**] (1.5L total) with good response in bp & urine output.
   -500cc NS bolus PRN
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
   -if becomes fluid unresponsive after 2 L consider placing central line
   & starting neosynephrine.
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, resulting in right hemiparesis and aphasia. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU due to respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, ventilator dependence, status epilepticus, hypotension, and EKG changes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia indicate a high risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Seizure recurrence: The patient is currently in status epilepticus, which means he is experiencing continuous seizures. There is a risk of recurrent seizures if the underlying cause is not identified and managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count on admission suggests an infection, and the presence of moderate gram-negative rods in the sputum culture indicates a possible bacterial infection. This could lead to worsening of the patient's condition or the development of a healthcare-associated infection.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has been receiving IV fluid boluses due to hypotension, and there is a concern for fluid responsiveness. Inadequate fluid management may lead to hypotension or fluid overload.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is a concern, given his previous stroke and current status epilepticus. There is a risk of further"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening due to aspiration and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing some hypotension, which could be related to increased sedation with IV fluids.
3. Risk for Aspiration: Due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of further aspiration events.
4. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Unasyn) for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic treatment with an H2 blocker"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, presenting with status epilepticus and respiratory distress. He has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. The patient has undergone several interventions, including attempts at central line placement, lumbar puncture, and administration of various medications such as propofol, Levophed, acyclovir, and antibiotics. He also has a history of seizure disorder for which he is taking Depakote and Trilepta. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizures/status epilepticus: The cause of the seizures is unknown, with concerns for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurologic event. Propofol infusion and Levophed for blood pressure support have been initiated. The plan includes following up with neurology, performing a lumbar puncture, and obtaining an MRI after EEG as per neurology recommendations. Acyclovir has been started for"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased briefly on am of [**10-18**].  Propofol increased thereafter for
   better seizure control.  Received 500 cc bolus x 3 overnight [**10-18**]
   [**10-19**] (1.5L total) with good response in bp & urine output.
   -500cc NS bolus PRN
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
   -if becomes fluid unresponsive after 2 L consider placing central line
   & starting neosynephrine.
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, presenting with respiratory distress, status epilepticus, and hypotension. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has an increased white blood cell count on admission, which could indicate an infection. He has copious secretions in his oral pharynx, and there is concern for aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration. His blood and urine cultures are negative thus far. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be secondary to sedation from the large amount of Ativan received in 5 hours. There is pooling of secretions in his oral pharynx, which raises concern for aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started for a 10-day course.
2. Ventilator dependency: The patient needs to remain on CMV Assist due to high levels of propofol desired by neurology. The ABG should be rechecked, and ventilator settings adjusted accordingly.
3. Status epilepticus: The cause of the patient's status epilepticus is unknown. Possible precipitants include infection, suboptimal medication regimen, or a new acute neurological event such as a stroke. The patient is on multiple anti-seizure medications, and continuous EEG is recommended.
4. Hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with history of CVA now admit with status epilepticus and
   requiring intubation and medication induced coma to break ongoing
   seizure activity.  This has been of limited beneift in terms of PLED
   activity persisting despite escalating doses of Propofol.
   1)Status Epilepticus-This persists despite increasing doses of Propofol
   and the trigger remains to be defined
   -Acyclovir in place
   -LP by Neuro team today as we were unsuccessful
   -Will need to move to Pentobarbitol as [**Doctor Last Name **] if activity persists and
   will utilize guidance from the Neurology team
   -Trileptal continuing
   -Depakote continuing
   -Will need to consider alternative [**Doctor Last Name **] to allow suppression of
   seizure activity
   -Will need a CNS image as soon as possible
   -Further propofol increase will be limited by both hypotension and
   bradycardia now present.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support with PEEP titration for hypoxemia
   -Patient with excellent tolerance of BP support
   -GNR's seen in sputum on gram stain
Unasyn/Vanco to change to
   Vanco/Zosyn
   3)Hypotension-
   -Likely a combination of medication effects and transient hypovolemia
   which is now resolved
   -Monitor for fever and will continue to support with pressors as
   needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) admitted to the ICU with status epilepticus and respiratory failure. The patient required intubation and medication-induced coma to break ongoing seizure activity. Despite escalating doses of Propofol, persistent PLED (polymorphic delta waves on electroencephalogram) activity persists.

The patient has been treated with Acyclovir for possible viral meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was attempted but not completed. Levophed has been required for blood pressure support. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 10/18/2105 at 12:33 AM (Ceftriaxone), 05:45 AM (Metronidazole), 06:00 AM (Ampicillin/Sulbactam), 08:00 AM (Vancomycin), and 08:02 AM (Acyclovir).

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Norepinephrine at 0.04 mcg/Kg/min and Propofol at 110 mcg/Kg/min. Other medications include ranitidine (prophylaxis) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 108"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg (increased), H2 blocker for
   GI ppx, VAP bundle.
   .
   10. Dispo: ICU level of care
   .
   11. Code: full code

   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction in [**2102**], resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. The patient was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Seizures/status epilepticus: The cause of the seizures is unknown, and there is concern for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurological event (new stroke). The patient is on Depakote and Trilepta, with an increased dose of Trilepta yesterday. Propofol is being administered as per neurologic recommendations, along with Levophed for blood pressure support. Further follow-up with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management is planned, as well as a lumbar puncture (LP) today arranged by neurology, MRI after EEG as per neuro, and continuation of current medications.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: This condition is likely multifactorial, including aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and sedation. Seizures can also contribute to mental status changes and increase the risk of aspiration. The chest X-ray (CXR) and sputum culture are concerning for aspiration, and sputum is growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Blood and urine cultures"

   57 yo male with history of CVA now with presentation with status
   epilepticus and with subsequent respiratory failure in the setting of
   airway protection needed as escalating doses of sedating medications
   are used to attempt to control seizure activity.
   1)Status Epilepticus-
   -Dilantin added
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3738**] to perform LP today, was deferred by Neuro yesterday after
   MICU team failed to obtain fluid on [**2105-10-19**] despite mulitple attempts.
   -Keppra
   -Trileptal
   -Depakote
   -Acyclovir all per neurology input
   -Will look to neurology recommendations in regards to future
   interventions and treatments given EEG findings today.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with transient hypoxemia yesterday--this
   was in the setting of continued positive fluid balance and persistent
   seizure activity.  This may well be evolution of persistent
   non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema as well as pleural effusions.  He will
   need PEEP titration to allow increase in airspace recruitment.
   -E. Coli seen in sputum and will refine to  narrow coverage following
   LP results and will maintain Vanco/CTX at elevated doses
   3)Hypotension-This has been attributable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident) who presented with status epilepticus and subsequent respiratory failure. He requires airway protection due to the use of escalating doses of sedating medications to control seizure activity. The patient has been diagnosed with pan-sensitive E. coli from sputum culture.

Medical Complications:

1. Status Epilepticus:
   - Dilantin has been added, and an LP (lumbar puncture) was deferred by Neurology yesterday.
   - The patient will be given Keppra, Trileptal, Depakote, and Acyclovir per Neurology input.
   - Future interventions and treatments will be based on EEG findings.

2. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient experienced transient hypoxemia yesterday.
   - This was associated with continued positive fluid balance and persistent seizure activity.
   - It may be evolving into non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
   - PEEP titration will be done to allow for airspace recruitment.

3. Hypotension:
   - Hypotension has been attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.
   - Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone will continue for coverage of likely pulmonary pathogens.
   - Coverage will be narrowed once the LP results are available.

Other Issues:
- The patient has altered mental status (not delirium), a history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, presenting with status epilepticus and respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

The patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

1. Seizures/status epilepticus: The cause of the seizures is unknown, and there is concern for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurological event (new stroke). The patient is on multiple anti-seizure medications, and propofol has been weaned to 60 mcg/kg/min. The increasing liver function tests (LFTs) and triglycerides while on propofol are concerning. Neurology was unsuccessful in performing a lumbar puncture (LP) today.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and sedation. Seizures can also contribute to mental status changes and increase the risk of aspiration. The chest X-ray and sputum culture indicate aspiration, and there is growth of pan-sensitive E. coli. Blood and urine cultures are negative so far.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to propofol sedation. The patient was adequately fluid-resuscitated with intravenous fluids (IVF) but is currently total body volume overloaded.

4. Bradycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   1. ECG changes: Discussed with cardiology.  Possible medication effect
   due to multiple anti-epileptic medications, however this was discussed
   with neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3626**] who did not feel that medications would have
   caused this.  Appears currently hemodynamically stable, however
   Levophed requirements have increased while Propofol has decreased.
   Other possible etiologies include ACS and wall motion abnormalities
   leading to cardiogenic shock.
   - TTE today
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - monitor ECGs
   - f/u cardiology consult
   .
   2.  Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt.  Without CSF to r/o meningitis, will continue to treat and abx
   changed yesterday to cover bacterial meningitis
   - continue abx for bacterial meningitis and acyclovir for viral
   meningitis
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuron, MRI-compatible leads being placed
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -current antibiotic treatment will cover for E. Coli PNA
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   4. Hypotension.  Concern that propofol is decreasing as Levophed is
   increasing.  Differential for hypotension includes hypovolemic which is
   unlikely given high volume status.  Cardiogenic possible after ECG
   changes and will f/u echo.  Septic shock is possible but pt has been
   afebrile, not bacteremia.  Spinal shock also a possibility given
   seizure activity.
   - continue Levophed to support blood pressure
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   5. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   6. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   7. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   8. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg (pt had BM yesterday), H2
   blocker for GI ppx, VAP bundle.
   .
   9. Dispo: ICU level of care
   .
   10. Code: full code

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke and residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress. The patient's recent events include unsuccessful lumbar puncture attempt yesterday due to inability to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for culture, concern for bacterial meningitis, and subsequent change in antibiotics to Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin. Levophed requirements increased overnight, and Propofol has been decreased. Telemetry showed changes in QRS complexes, and a 12-lead ECG obtained appears to have diffuse ST depressions in V2-V6 and ST elevations in II, AVL. Cardiology was called. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

Infusions include Norepinephrine at 0.12 mcg/Kg/min and Propofol at 60 mcg/Kg/min. Other ICU medications include Ranitidine (prophylaxis), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and Dilantin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke in [**2102**], resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Seizures/status epilepticus: The cause of the seizures is unknown, with concerns for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurologic event (new stroke). The patient is on multiple anti-seizure medications, and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: This condition is likely multifactorial, involving aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and sedation. Seizures can also contribute to mental status changes and increase the risk of aspiration. CXR and sputum culture are concerning for aspiration, and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli. Blood and urine cultures are negative thus far.

3. Hypotension: This is likely due to propofol sedation. The patient has been adequately fluid-resuscitated with intravenous fluids and is currently total body volume overloaded.

4. Bradycardia: This is likely related to propofol. Levophed has improved the patient's blood pressure.

5. EKG changes: These changes are likely due to demand ischemia. Enzymes are negative, but the"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with admission with status epilepticus now with some
   suggestion of improving control of seizure activity based on neurology
   review of EEG.  What is, however, concerning is that he is
   demonstrating a decreased response to painful simuli.  He has had
   persistent pressor requirement even in the setting of decrease in
   propofol dosing.  In addition he has evolution of significant ECG
   changes in a diffuse, non-anatomic distribution which is concerning for
   a medication effect with iscehmia, primary conduction system disease
   less likely, but ,the medications at their current levels are unlikley
   to contribute to these changes.
   1)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   -Keppra
   -Depakote
   -Trileptal
   -Dilantin
   -Propofol 60-->40 and with increased TG
s will move to change sedating
   [**Doctor Last Name **] if further decrease in TG
s not seen with further propofol
   decrease
   -Amp/Vanco/CTX/Acyclovir for all possible sources of meningitis with
   inability to obtain LP to fully evaluate possibility of CNS infection.
   -MRI timing to be moved up in timing given both the absence of a clear
   source for his Status Epilepticus and the concerning findings on ECG
   overnight without clear evidence of source now that we have had some
   capacity to stabilize seizure activity.
   2)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed at 0.18
   -Volume overload is clearly present
   -Wean levophed as possible
   -ECHO today
   -Is likely a combination of aspiration pneumonia, sedating medications
   and possible changes in cardiac output as we have failed to demonstrate
   an improvement in BP with wean of propofol.
   -Will trial 1 liter bolus this morning
   -Doubt spinal shock but is concerning lack of improvement with wean of
   propofol.  Will look to response to IVF bolus and ECHO to categorize
   persistent hypotension.
   3)ECG Changes
ST segment depressions-
   -Will check ECHO today to eval for possible pericardial insult of wall
   motion abnormalities
   -Will cycle CK
   -Will reposition CVL today if CXR shows very poor position although
   this is less likely as a source here
   -Replete lytes although they are normal at first check
   -Would be very atypical for
cerebral T-waves
 but may be a variant if
   all other causes are ruled out
will have to consider move up of timing
   for MRI study if seizures felt to be controlled
   Additional issues to be treated as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted with status epilepticus. There has been some improvement in controlling the seizure activity based on the neurology review of EEG. However, the patient is demonstrating a decreased response to painful stimuli, persistent pressor requirement even with decreased propofol dosing, and evolution of significant ECG changes in a diffuse, non-anatomic distribution. These changes are concerning for medication effect with ischemia, primary conduction system disease less likely, but medications at their current levels are unlikely to contribute to these changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1) SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS: The patient is experiencing ongoing seizure activity, which needs to be managed and controlled.
2) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient has persistent hypotension despite pressor support and weaning of propofol. This may be due to volume overload, aspiration pneumonia, sedating medications, or changes in cardiac output.
3) ECG Changes: The patient is showing diffuse ST segment depressions on the ECG. This could be indicative of a medication effect with ischemia or other cardiac issues.

Further evaluation and management are required for these potential medical complications."
