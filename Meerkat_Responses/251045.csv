   Imaging: CXR:  ICD remains in place, with leads terminating in right
   atrium and
   right ventricle. No visible lead fracture on this portable chest
   radiograph,
   which is not optimal for evaluating subtle lead abnormalities. Note is
   made
   of a slightly curved course of the radiodense coil of the right atrial
   lead,
   which is an apparent change from the prior radiograph. If warranted
   clinically, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs could be
   performed to
   more fully evaluate this region, as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7554**]. Cardiac

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1069**] is a 43 year-old male with cardiomyopathy s/p ICD found to
   have ICD lead dysfunction, transferred for ICD revision.
   # ICD lead fracture:  The patient was found on routine monitoring to
   have increased impedance of his ventricular lead, likely indicating
   lead fracture.
   - CXR does not appear to show frank lead fracture.
   - Plan per EP for pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement on
   Monday.
   - Will need type and cross of 2 units over the weekend in preparation
   for the procedure on Monday.
   - Anesthesia consult per EP in preparation for the procedure on Monday
   pending.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - NPO p MN on Sunday.
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and his most
   recent TTE in [**2136**] showed an EF of 45%.  He appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, toprol, and verapamil per home regimen.
   # RHYTHM/Hx of Ventricular tachycardia:  The patient is currently in
   sinus rhythm.  Pacemaker A-pacing at 60 bpm when native rate drops
   below that.
   - monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD is currently off so if he develops ventricular tachycardia will
   require ACLS.
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no history of CAD and had a clean cath in
   [**2136**].
   - Continue ASA daily for primary prevention.
   # GERD:
   - Continue omeprazole.
   # Depression:
   - Continue cymbalta.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU for ICD revision due to ICD lead dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/70 mmHg to 147/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of crackles in the bibasilar region of the lungs.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no acute distress. The patient has a first-degree AV block on ECG, and his peripheral pulses are present bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. His respiratory system is clear bilaterally, and he has no lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment is incomplete due to the patient not being assessed for tone, movement, and response.

Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is a slight elevation in creatinine and potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging reveals an ICD device in place with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. No visible lead fracture is noted on the portable chest radiograph, but there is a slightly curved course of the"

   Imaging: CXR:  ICD remains in place, with leads terminating in right
   atrium and
   right ventricle. No visible lead fracture on this portable chest
   radiograph,
   which is not optimal for evaluating subtle lead abnormalities. Note is
   made
   of a slightly curved course of the radiodense coil of the right atrial
   lead,
   which is an apparent change from the prior radiograph. If warranted
   clinically, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs could be
   performed to
   more fully evaluate this region, as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7554**]. Cardiac
   silhouette is mildly enlarged, the aorta is slightly unfolded, and
   lungs are
   clear.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1069**] is a 43 year-old male with cardiomyopathy s/p ICD found to
   have ICD lead dysfunction, transferred for ICD revision.
   # ICD lead fracture:  The patient was found on routine monitoring to
   have increased impedance of his ventricular lead, likely indicating
   lead fracture.
   - CXR does not appear to show frank lead fracture.
   - Plan per EP for pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement on
   Monday.
   - Will need type and cross of 2 units over the weekend in preparation
   for the procedure on Monday.
   - Anesthesia consult per EP in preparation for the procedure on Monday
   pending.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - NPO p MN on Sunday.
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and his most
   recent TTE in [**2136**] showed an EF of 45%.  He appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue lisinopril, toprol, and verapamil per home regimen.
   # RHYTHM/Hx of Ventricular tachycardia:  The patient is currently in
   sinus rhythm.  Pacemaker A-pacing at 60 bpm when native rate drops
   below that.
   - monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD is currently off so if he develops ventricular tachycardia will
   require ACLS.
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no history of CAD and had a clean cath in
   [**2136**].
   - Continue ASA daily for primary prevention.
   # GERD:
   - Continue omeprazole.
   # Depression:
   - Continue cymbalta.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with cardiomyopathy who was found to have ICD lead dysfunction and has been transferred for ICD revision. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/70 mmHg to 147/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's lab results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and electrolytes. However, the platelet count is slightly low at 192 K/uL. The patient's imaging reveals an ICD in place with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is no visible lead fracture on the chest radiograph, but there is an apparent change in the course of the radiodense coil of the right atrial lead.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ICD lead fracture: The patient has increased impedance of his ventricular lead, likely indicating lead fracture. A chest radiograph does not show frank lead fracture, and the plan is for pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement on Monday. Type and cross of 2 units will be done over the weekend in preparation for the procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with cardiomyopathy who was found to have an ICD lead fracture, indicating increased impedance of his ventricular lead. He will be undergoing pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement on Monday. The patient is euvolemic and his most recent TTE showed an EF of 45%. He is currently in sinus rhythm and will be monitored on telemetry. The ICD is currently off, so if he develops ventricular tachycardia, ACLS will be required. The patient has no history of CAD and had a clean cath in [**2136**]. He is on medications for various conditions including lisinopril, toprol, verapamil, ASA, omeprazole, and zoloft. The patient is NPO at midnight and will receive type and cross of 2 units over the weekend in preparation for the procedure on Monday. Anesthesia consult per EP is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lead extraction and replacement procedure complications: There is a risk of complications during the pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement procedure such as infection, bleeding, pneumothorax, lead dislodgement, or device malfunction.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient may develop ventricular tachycardia if the ICD is not functioning properly. Monitoring on telemetry will help in early detection and prompt management of any arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient may be at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy and previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted to the ICU for ICD lead revision due to a lead fracture. The patient has been on telemetry monitoring, NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for the procedure, and receiving prophylactic heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/56 to 130/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals distant S1 and S2 heart sounds, clear lungs, and no signs of infection or edema. Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, electrolyte levels, and renal function. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, for which he is on lisinopril, toprol, and verapamil, and has a clean coronary angiography from [**2136**]. His other medical issues include GERD and depression, for which he is taking omeprazole and zoloft respectively. The plan is to proceed with pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement today. The patient's disposition will be CCU for now with a call out post-lead revision if stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to the presence of an ICD lead and potential manipulation during the revision procedure.
2. Bleeding: Prophylactic heparin sodium may increase the risk of bleeding, especially during the procedure or if there are any complications.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and may be at risk of developing arrhythmias, particularly if the ICD is turned off.
4. Cardiovascular collapse: During the procedure, there is a risk of cardiovascular collapse if there are complications such as lead dislodgment or arrhythmias.
5. Anesthesia-related complications: The patient is receiving anesthesia for the procedure, which carries its own set of risks such as allergic reactions, respiratory problems, and medication errors.
6. Kidney injury: The use of contrast dye during the procedure may potentially cause kidney injury, especially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.
7. Lead perforation: During the extraction and replacement of the ICD lead, there is a risk of lead perforation into the heart or other structures.
8. Stroke: Although rare, there is a potential risk of stroke if there are complications during the procedure or due to thromboembolic events."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient underwent an ICD revision and was returned to the CCU at 7 p.m. The physician recommended getting a chest X-ray (CXR) PA and lateral in the morning, placing the right arm in a sling, and continuing antibiotic therapy for one week. At 9 p.m., the patient complained of nausea and dyspnea, but vitals were stable. Zofran 4 mg IV was administered, and the EKG showed no changes. The CXR did not show any pneumothorax (our read). An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2 of 189 mmHg. At 3 a.m., the patient complained of nausea again but was relieved with Zofran. Otherwise, the patient remained asymptomatic. A post-cath check was normal, and Ativan was ordered to help with anxiety/sleep/nausea.

24-hour events include an arterial line start at 5:38 p.m. and receiving the patient from the OR at 7:50 p.m. The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was administered at 6:00 p.m. on 02/29/2140. Lorazepam (Ativan) was given at 3:40 a.m. on 03/01/2140.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy who underwent an ICD revision due to ICD lead dysfunction. The patient experienced nausea and dyspnea after the procedure, but vitals remained stable. Zofran 4 mg IV was given, and the EKG showed no changes. A chest X-ray revealed no pneumothorax. ABG results showed a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 38, and HCO3 of 189. The patient was also started on lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety/sleep/nausea.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 132.2 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,320 mL, including 120 mL by mouth, 120 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 1,200 mL of intravenous fluids. Output includes 1,100 mL of urine, 685 mL of drainage, and a negative balance of 565 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, sodium of 100 mg/dL, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, chloride of 26 mEq/L, magnesium of 1.1 mg/dL, calcium of 9.6 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.4 mg/dL, glucose of 123 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. ICD lead fracture: The patient has an increased impedance of his ventricular lead, indicating a possible lead fracture. An EP recommended pacemaker and lead extraction and replacement.
2. PUMP: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%. He appears euvolemic on exam, and his current medications include lisinopril, toprol, and verapamil.
3. RHYTHM/Hx of Ventricular tachycardia: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a pacemaker set at 60 bpm when the native rate drops below that. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing, and the ICD is currently off.
4. CORONARIES: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease and had a clean catheterization in [**2136**]. He will continue taking ASA daily for primary prevention.
5. GERD: Omeprazole will be continued.
6. Depression: Zoloft will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of indwelling lines and devices.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, and if the ICD is not functioning properly, he may be at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating a potential risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering his history of GERD.
5. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, and there may be potential drug interactions that need to be monitored.

It is important to closely monitor the patient for these potential complications and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan as needed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy who underwent an ICD revision for lead dysfunction. The patient's current complaints include nausea and dyspnea, but vital signs remain stable. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and cardiac medications. The patient's recent tests show no signs of pneumonia on chest X-ray and normal arterial blood gas levels. The patient's laboratory results indicate slightly elevated potassium levels but otherwise normal values. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and he is expected to advance his diet today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on a 7-day course of cephalexin, indicating a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening symptoms is necessary.
2. Lead Fracture: The patient had an ICD lead fracture, which required revision. Monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and function will be crucial to detect any potential complications related to the leads.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%. Regular monitoring of his cardiac function and medication compliance is important to manage this condition effectively.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, and his pacemaker is set to demand atrial pacing. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is essential to detect any"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with cardiomyopathy who underwent an ICD revision for lead dysfunction. He is currently in the ICU for monitoring and management of his condition. The patient is experiencing some soreness at the pacer site and reports nausea, which has been relieved with Zofran. His vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. The patient's cardiac function appears to be well-managed with his current medications. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on a 7-day course of cephalexin due to the ICD revision surgery. There is a risk of surgical site infection, which should be monitored for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage at the pacer site.
2. Lead fracture: The patient had a lead fracture indicated by increased impedance of his ventricular lead. Close monitoring of the ICD function and lead integrity is essential to detect any further complications related to the lead fracture.
3. Cardiomyopathy exacerbation: Although the patient's recent TTE showed an EF (ejection fraction) of 45%, there is still a risk of cardiomyopathy exacerbation, which could lead to heart failure symptoms like shortness of breath, fluid retention, or decreased cardiac output.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is receiving prophylactic SQ UF Heparin for DVT prevention. Monitoring for symptoms of VTE, such as calf pain or swelling, is crucial.
5. Medication side effects: The patient is on multiple cardiac medications, including lisinopril, toprol, verapamil, ASA, omeprazole, and zoloft. Monitoring for any potential side effects or drug interactions is necessary.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. A comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition would require further clinical evaluation."

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with cardiomyopathy who underwent an ICD revision yesterday due to ICD lead dysfunction. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing nausea and dyspnea, but his vital signs remain stable. His recent ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2 of 189 mmHg. 

The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45% on his most recent TTE. He is currently on lisinopril, toprol, and verapamil as part of his home regimen. 

The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia and has a pacemaker with demand atrial pacing. His ICD was recently revised, and it is now back on. 

The patient's coronary arteries are clear, as evidenced by a clean catheterization in [**2136**]. He will continue taking ASA daily for primary prevention of coronary artery disease. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with GERD and depression. He will continue taking omeprazole and zoloft, respectively. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's diet is being advanced to a cardiac/HH diet as tolerated. Regular insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control. The patient has an arterial line placed and will receive prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP"
