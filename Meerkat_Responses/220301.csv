","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of smoldering myeloma, dementia, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU and presents with confusion and fevers. Her chest X-ray is concerning for pneumonia (pna). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS infection: The patient's altered mental status and aphasia could be due to a CNS infection. Further investigation through lumbar puncture (LP) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned.
2. Pneumonia (pna): The patient's fevers and CXR findings raise concern for pneumonia. Occult infection should be considered, especially given the lack of lung findings on physical examination. Culture data is negative, and a stool test for Clostridium difficile is pending.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, which may indicate heart failure. Rate control and anticoagulation therapy are ongoing.
4. Renal function: Although the patient's current renal function is at baseline, previous concerns about acute renal failure are mentioned.
5. Code status: The patient is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate).

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of smoldering myeloma, dementia, atrial fibrillation, confusion, and fevers. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's symptoms include aphasia, altered mental status, and potential signs of infection such as fever. Imaging studies reveal no infarction or abnormalities in the arteries. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns regarding possible pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and kidney function. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers and chest X-ray findings raise concerns for pneumonia. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential organ failure.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The radiographic appearance of the chest X-ray is concerning for CHF. If the patient's heart function worsens, it can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output.
3. Central Nervous System (CNS) Infection: The patient's altered mental status and aphasia may be due to a CNS infection. If not promptly identified and treated, this can progress to severe neurological complications.
4. Renal Dysfunction: Although the patient's current renal function is at baseline, there is concern for potential acute renal failure. Monitoring kidney function closely"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, fluent speech, and improved dramatically after undergoing an MRI. The patient's allergies include codeine, nausea/vomiting, pamidronate disodium, renal toxicity; primidone, unknown; dapsone, anemia; and last dose of antibiotics, which were vancomycin on 06/15/2184 at 02:00 PM, ceftriaxone on 06/16/2184 at 12:00 AM, and ampicillin on 06/16/2184 at 06:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/89 to 187/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with an ABG result of ///23/. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert, oriented, and moving all extremities with fluent speech. The chest X-ray shows a contrast-enhancing lesion in the left frontal-parietal region consistent with a known meningioma. The patient has a 1+ edema in the extremities and normal abdominal examination. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, who is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for the resolution of aphasia and the possibility of dementia. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure ranging from 106-187 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has received multiple infusions and antibiotics. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows an old meningioma without acute cerebral vascular accident or flow-limiting stenoses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency or urgency: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which could lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
2. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function, which may require further investigation and intervention.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels, which need to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/INR and PTT suggest a bleeding risk, and the patient may require close monitoring and possible reversal of any anticoagulant therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with altered mental status. She has a history of hypertension, myeloma, and allergies to codeine, pamidronate sodium, primidone, and dapsone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/48-143/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis and antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis. The patient's EEG, ultrasound, and lumbar puncture results were unremarkable. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for new-onset aphasia which has since resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status improved with the initiation of low-flow state therapy, suggesting the possibility of toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA): The patient's blood pressure is running high, and her mental status is better, which could support the possibility of a TIA.
3. Bacterial meningitis: Although the patient has been on antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis, the lumbar puncture results were unimpressive, making bacterial meningitis less likely.
4. Fevers: The etiology of the patient's fevers remains unclear, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Aphasia: completely resolved, still concerning for TIA,
   interesting that her BP are running in 170-180 range and her mental
   status is better
 supporting possible low flow state yesterdya and a
   TIA- let her autoreg but is sustained BP higher than 180 would start a
   low dose titratable medication, check  carotis ultrasound
   2.       Fevers: etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] clturesd, one outstanding issue
   is LP as we had empirically covered would need to give FFP and doubt is
   true source since she improved so dramatically makes bacterial meming
   even on ABX less likely.
   Would favor dc all abx and defer LP
 but will discuss with Neurology
   and pts family

","Summary:
The patient presented with altered mental status and has undergone several tests and treatments in the ICU. They have a history of myeloma, hypertension, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they have atrial fibrillation and an elevated blood pressure ranging from 170-180 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results indicate some abnormalities. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and there are crackles in their chest, particularly on the right side. The patient's neurological assessment shows that they are not fully responsive and their movement, tone, and other neurological functions are not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and calcium, while their white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is consistently high, reaching levels above 180 mmHg. This could lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
2. Possible transient ischemic attack (TIA): The patient's mental status has improved with sustained high blood pressure, suggesting a potential TIA. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, but the source has not been identified yet. This could indicate an ongoing infection that requires further evaluation and treatment.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient"
