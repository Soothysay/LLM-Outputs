   EEG [**9-29**]
   Abnormal routine EEG due to the slow background with
   occasional suppressive bursts. These findings suggest a widespread
   encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. Hypoxia is another possible explanation. Nevertheless,
   there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although
   encephalopathies
   can obscure focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform
   features.
   CT head [**9-28**]
   Unchanged
   appearance of right parietal subdural hematoma and right frontal
   intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No new large areas of hemorrhage
   identified.

   1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
   2. Cholelithiasis, unchanged.
   3. Bilateral renal hypodensities, likely cysts, stable in appearance.
   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode, hypertension and seizure.
   79 yo woman with ESRD on HD who was admitted to medicine [**2113-9-28**] after
   fall of unclear etiology with head trauma and CT scan + for small right
   parietal SDH and right frontal superior intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   Her hospital course has been notable for somnolance peri-HD this
   afternoon and afterwards. She was triggered for change in mental status
   around midnight
   # Seizure: Most likely related to SDH/IPH with subtheraputic phenytoin
   but also could be [**2-18**] hypertensive emergency given BP elevated to 180s
   at the time of seizure. No known seizure history.
   - Reload with phenytoin iv, then continue maintenanc dose po, check
   level 2-4 hours after load, goal level per neuro ([**11-1**] vs 15-20)
   - seizure and aspiration precuations
   - EEG
   - given wittnessed aspiration monitor for progression of symptoms with
   fever, leukocytosis, sputum, progressive infiltrate, tachypnea to help
   differentiate aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.
   - cont phenytoin as above, hold aspirin
   - neuro checks q2
   - repeat imaging per neurosurgery
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180.
   - will avoid hydralazine in her as may cause cerebro-vasodilation
   - will try labetolol iv (test dose of 5mg iv to start, uptitrate as she
   requires) to achieve SBP goal 140-160.
   - close hemodynamic monitoring
   # Syncope: Unclear exact history but per team no post-ictal state at
   that time making seizure less likely for that. Arrythmia, sturctural
   heart abnormality are possible, as is dehydration and hypoglycemia.
   - monitor on tele
   - consider tte when more stable
   - f/u eeg but treatment based on in-hospital event
   - f/u thyroid studies
   - obtain further history to evaluate
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter: Check TSH, fT4, T4 given hypertension
   thoguh doubt thyrotoxicosis though this could present atypically in a
   79 yo and could explain both htn and syncope via arrhythmia.
   - continue methimazole
   - f/u thyroid studies
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running
   in high 100s.
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet and HD per renal recs.
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG to suction, consider TF while somnolent but hopeful
   that she will wake and be able to take po, replete lytes.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, no gi currently but could add if
   elevated icp, ssi.
   # Access: NGT, right femoral CVC, right tunnelled IJ HD cath.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS.
   - Too far out from seizure to be pos-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity
   - EEG did show encephalopathy- could be infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Follow lytes
   - Check a tox screen
   - Follow dilantin level
   - Consult neuro
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Repeat head CT today
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   - Consult neuro
   - Continue dilantin.  Goal to keep dilantin level in teens (but high
   enough that pt does not seize)
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.

   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event but no new infiltrates seen on CXR,
   not hypoxic.  Hold on empiric treatment
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis. Can consider LP but will be
   difficult given her AMS. Will check with neuro
   - Blood and urine cultures
   - CXR tomorrow
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - On Methimazole; holding for now
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) after experiencing a syncopal episode at home. She has been experiencing altered mental status (AMS), hypertension, and a seizure. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 136/56 mmHg to 184/112 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Medical Complications:
1. AMS: The patient continues to have AMS, which could be due to various causes such as infection, metabolic disturbances, or medications. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, but the EEG did not show any epileptiform features. It is possible that the seizure was triggered by the SDH/IPH, hypertension, or an infectious etiology. The patient is currently on Dilantin to prevent further seizures.
3. SDH/IPH: The patient has a subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely due to a fall or possibly secondary to uncontrolled hypertension. Neurosurgery consultation is recommended for further management.

   Assessment and Plan
   Asssessment and plan: 79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who
   presents with SDH and IPH after a syncopal episode, hypertension and
   seizure.
   # Seizure: Most likely related to SDH/IPH with subtheraputic phenytoin
   but also could be [**2-18**] hypertensive emergency given BP elevated to 180s
   at the time of seizure. No known seizure history.
   - Reload with phenytoin iv, then continue maintenanc dose po, check
   level 2-4 hours after load, goal level per neuro ([**11-1**] vs 15-20)
   - seizure and aspiration precuations
   - EEG
   - given wittnessed aspiration monitor for progression of symptoms with
   fever, leukocytosis, sputum, progressive infiltrate, tachypnea to help
   differentiate aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.
   - cont phenytoin as above, hold aspirin
   - neuro checks q2
   - repeat imaging per neurosurgery
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180.
   - will avoid hydralazine in her as may cause cerebro-vasodilation
   - will try labetolol iv (test dose of 5mg iv to start, uptitrate as she
   requires) to achieve SBP goal 140-160.
   - close hemodynamic monitoring
   # Syncope: Unclear exact history but per team no post-ictal state at
   that time making seizure less likely for that. Arrythmia, sturctural
   heart abnormality are possible, as is dehydration and hypoglycemia.
   - monitor on tele
   - consider tte when more stable
   - f/u eeg but treatment based on in-hospital event
   - f/u thyroid studies
   - obtain further history to evaluate
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter: Check TSH, fT4, T4 given hypertension
   thoguh doubt thyrotoxicosis though this could present atypically in a
   79 yo and could explain both htn and syncope via arrhythmia.
   - continue methimazole
   - f/u thyroid studies
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running
   in high 100s.
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet and HD per renal recs.
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG to suction, consider TF while somnolent but hopeful
   that she will wake and be able to take po, replete lytes.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, no gi currently but could add if
   elevated icp, ssi.
   # Access: NGT, right femoral CVC, right tunnelled IJ HD cath.

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and toxic multinodular goiter. She presents with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode, hypertension, and seizure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/56 mmHg to 184/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has been started on IV phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis and will be continued on maintenance dose orally, with a goal level per neurologist's recommendation. The patient's neurological status will be closely monitored, and she will undergo repeat imaging per neurosurgery recommendations.

Regarding the patient's hypertension, temporally related to hemorrhage, it is unclear if it preceded or followed the hemorrhage. However, given the patient's documented baseline blood pressure of 130-150 mmHg and her history of peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, it is reasonable to think that her arteries are generally less compliant. Therefore, improved blood pressure control is required, especially considering the seizure at a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg.

   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS.
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity
   - EEG did show encephalopathy- could be infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Follow lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level
   - Consult neuro
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Head CT did not show any change
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   - neuron following; follow up recs
   - Continue dilantin.  Goal to keep dilantin level in teens (but high
   enough that pt does not seize)
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted with subdural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage after a syncopal episode at home, accompanied by hypertension and seizure. The patient remains in altered mental status and is intubated. 

24-hour events include an unsuccessful lumbar puncture attempt with plans to perform it under fluoroscopy this morning, an MRI/MRA last night requiring paralysis, and a fever of 101 degrees at 4 pm yesterday. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 151/61 to 188/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on propofol infusion and other ICU medications. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 342 mL total in and 282 mL IV fluid, with an output of 2010 mL total out, resulting in a negative balance of 1668 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings of tidal volume at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12, positive end-expiratory pressure at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with slight distress, pupils equal and reactive"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS.  Most likely due to SDH/IPH.  Other
   etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, CVA
   - Follow up MRI from [**9-30**]
   - To get LP today, [**10-1**], under fluoro
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity
   - EEG did show encephalopathy- could be infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Following lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today [**11-29**].
   - Follow up final neuro recs
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Head CT did not show any change
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180.
   - Start po Labetalol 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV Labetalol prn for SBPs>150
   # Syncope: Unclear exact history but per team no post-ictal state at
   that time making seizure less likely for that. Arrythmia, sturctural
   heart abnormality are possible, as is dehydration and hypoglycemia.
   - monitor on tele
   - consider tte when more stable
   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event but no new infiltrates seen on CXR,
   not hypoxic.  Hold on empiric treatment
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis. Can consider LP but will be
   difficult given her AMS. Will check with neuro
   - Blood and urine cultures
   - CXR tomorrow
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running
   in high 100s.
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet and HD per renal recs.  [**Month (only) 51**] need
   phos binder when able to take po
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG tube in place, consider TF while somnolent but hopeful
   that she will wake and be able to take po, replete lytes.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, will need PPI vs H2 blocker if
   she stays intubated longer than today
   # Access: right femoral CVC, right tunnelled IJ HD cath, schedule for
   PICC on Monday
   # Code: full, confirmed with sister.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home, accompanied by hypertension and seizure. She was intubated on [9-30] for MRI and planned for extubation on [10-1] following lumbar puncture (LP) under fluoroscopy.

The patient continues to have altered mental status (AMS) likely due to SDH/IPH. Other possible etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The EEG did not show seizure activity but showed encephalopathy, which could be infectious or toxic-metabolic. The head CT did not show any change.

The patient has no known history of seizure, but EEG was negative due to being already on Dilantin at the time of study. The most likely etiology of the seizure is [2-18] SDH/IPH. Other possible etiologies include hypertensive emergency or infectious (i.e., meningitis/encephalitis).

The patient's blood pressure is temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if it preceded or followed hemorrhage. It is relatively significant from her documented baseline of 130-150, though given her peripheral vascular disease and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presents with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated on [**9-30**] for an MRI and the goal was to extubate her on [**10-1**] following a lumbar puncture (LP) under fluoroscopy.

The patient continues to have altered mental status (AMS), most likely due to SDH/IPH. Other possible etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The MRI shows no interval change, no evidence of infarction, and no midline shift. The LP is negative for pleocytosis.

The patient also has a known history of seizure, but the EEG was negative, although she was already on dilantin at the time of study. Most likely, the seizure was related to [**2-18**] SDH/IPH. Other possible etiologies include hypertensive emergency or infectious causes such as meningitis/encephalitis.

Additionally, the patient has likely traumatic SDH/IPH given her fall, although it is also possible that hypertension played a role, given her newly elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS.  Most likely due to SDH/IPH.  Other
   etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, CVA
   - Follow up MRI from [**9-30**]
   - To get LP today, [**10-1**], under fluoro
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity
   - EEG did show encephalopathy- could be infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Following lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today [**11-29**].
   - Follow up final neuro recs
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Head CT did not show any change
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180.
   - Start po Labetalol 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV Labetalol prn for SBPs>150
   # Syncope: Unclear exact history but per team no post-ictal state at
   that time making seizure less likely for that. Arrythmia, sturctural
   heart abnormality are possible, as is dehydration and hypoglycemia.
   - monitor on tele
   - consider tte when more stable
   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event but no new infiltrates seen on CXR,
   not hypoxic.  Hold on empiric treatment
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis. Can consider LP but will be
   difficult given her AMS. Will check with neuro
   - Blood and urine cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhage after a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated for an MRI and the goal was to extubate her following a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy.

The patient continues to have altered mental status (AMS) most likely due to the subdural hematoma/intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Other etiologies for AMS include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient underwent a follow-up MRI, EEG, and toxicology screening, which did not show any seizure activity but did show encephalopathy, possibly infectious or toxic-metabolic in nature.

The patient has a history of seizure, but the EEG was negative, and she was already on Dilantin at the time of the study. The most likely etiology of the seizure is the subdural hematoma/intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Other possible etiologies include hypertensive emergency or infectious causes such as meningitis/encephalitis.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, which temporally relates to the hemorrhage. It is unclear if the hypertension preceded or followed the hemorrhage. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable since admission,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with a syncopal episode at home and subsequently found to have a subdural hematoma (SDH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). 

The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) under fluoroscopy guidance, but unfortunately experienced apnea post-procedure and required assisted ventilation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a high respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 150-190, indicating potential respiratory failure. The head of the bed has been elevated, and a chest X-ray (CXR) has been ordered to rule out pneumonia from possible aspiration during the seizure.

The patient continues to exhibit altered mental status (AMS) likely due to the SDH/IPH, but other potential etiologies such as infectious, toxic-metabolic, post-ictal, or cerebrovascular accidents have been considered and ruled out. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed encephalopathy but no seizure activity, and the seizure is believed to be likely related to the SDH/IPH rather than a primary seizure disorder. Dilantin levels are being monitored, and the patient is on antiepileptic therapy.

The patient's hypertension is tempor"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presents with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent and persistent decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1691**]ves.
   # Ventiliation:  Requirng ventilation with  high RSBI 150-190, did not
   have previous respiratory failure, should be able to come off of vent.
   -continue following RSBIs, consider SBTs even with RSBIs>100,
   -elevate head of bed
   -CXR for developing PNA from ?aspiration after seizure
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS.  Most likely due to SDH/IPH.  Other
   etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, CVA
   - MRI shows no interval change, no evidence of infarction, no midline
   shift, MRA shows no stenosis.
   - LP negative for pleocytosis
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity
   - EEG did show encephalopathy- could be infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Following lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase
   dilantin if falls <10.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Check CXR, Urine, for sites of occult infection
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   Neurosurgery following, appreciate recs.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has
   been in normal range, and dropped to 80s w/ labetalol yesterday.
   - Continue w/ IV Labetalol , 5mg prn for SBPs>160
   # Syncope: Unclear exact history but per team no post-ictal state at
   that time making seizure less likely for that. Arrythmia, sturctural
   heart abnormality are possible, as is dehydration and hypoglycemia.
   - monitor on tele
   - consider tte when more stable
   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event but no new infiltrates seen on CXR,
   not hypoxic.  Hold on empiric treatment
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis, had LP w/ no WBCs.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - CXR today
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running
   in high 100s.
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet and HD per renal recs.  [**Month (only) 51**] need
   phos binder when able to take po
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG tube in place, beginning TFs w/ recs from Nutrtion.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, added  H2 blocker Ranitidine
   150mg NG, [**Hospital1 7**] for stress ulcer.
   # Access: right femoral CVC, right tunnelled IJ HD cath, Midline
   placement scheduled today, will remove the femoral line after
   successful placement.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventiliation:  Ventilation improving, but still requiring, on PS 10,
   PEEP 5, w/ RSBIs around 100, did not have previous respiratory failure,
   should be able to come off of vent. [**Month (only) 51**] have developing PNA w/ fever
   and RLL consolidation
   -continue following RSBIs, consider SBTs even with RSBIs>100,
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA
   -Consider extubation if MS improves after HD today.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, but showing slow improvement.  Most
   likely due to SDH/IPH.  Other etiologies include infectious,
   toxic-metabolic, seizure, CVA, sepsis. Most likely multifactorial.
   - MRI shows no interval change, no evidence of infarction, no midline
   shift, MRA shows no stenosis.
   - LP negative for pleocytosis
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity, only encephalopathy- could be
   infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Following lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase
   dilantin if falls <10.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Check urine if possible,
   - MS may improve after HD
   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event and now ?new consolidation, ?edema
   vs PNA on CXR, not hypoxic.
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis, had LP w/ no WBCs.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Started empiric treatment for HAP w/ increasing fevers yesterday,
   Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro, sputum cx pending.
   - Sputum Gram stain: 4+ gram pos cocci in pars and clusters
   - Decreased fever after Abx started.
   - Check LFTs, [**Doctor First Name 354**], Lip to check for other locus of infection/abd
   process
   - Contact ID for Abx approval
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   - if no further acute change in MS, no need to re-image.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has
   been in normal range, and dropped to 80s w/ labetalol yesterday.
   - Continue w/ IV Labetalol , 5mg prn for SBPs>160
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglycemics, SSI with q6 accu checks. Running
   in high 100s, last 290s after TF started. Increase SSI, consider adding
   standing insulin order. Reassess after HD today.
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet and HD per renal recs.
   - HD today.
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG tube in place, TFs w/ recs from [**Last Name (LF) 1732**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   continue.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, added  H2 blocker Ranitidine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home. She also has hypertension and had a seizure. She was intubated on [9-30] for an MRI with the goal of extubation on [10-1] following lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy, but unable to be removed from the ventilator due to poor respiratory system blood oxygenation index (RSBI) and persistent decreased mental status.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Ventilation: Ventilation improving, still requiring PS 10, PEEP 5, with RSBIs around 100. She did not have previous respiratory failure and should be able to come off the ventilator. However, she is developing pneumonia (PNA) with fever and right lower lobe consolidation. 
   - Continue following RSBIs, consider spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) even with RSBIs>100.
   - Elevate head of bed.
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin for PNA.
   - Consider extubation if mental status improves after hemodialysis (HD) today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presents with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after a syncopal episode at home. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, seizures, and altered mental status. She has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia. Imaging studies show increasing right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and increasing right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia. The patient is already receiving empiric antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Seizures: The patient experienced a witnessed seizure event, and there is a concern for recurrent seizures given her altered mental status and recent SDH/ICH. Dilantin has been initiated to manage seizure activity.
3. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The patient's fever and altered mental status raise concern for meningitis or encephalitis. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, which was"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventilation:  Difficulty weaning from vent likely [**2-18**] PNA.  Continues
   to have unfavorable RSBIs.  Requiring PS 10, PEEP 5.
   -continue following RSBIs, consider SBTs even with RSBIs>100,
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA
   -Continue to follow RSBI
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, likely due to SDH/IPH with a superimposed
   toxic-metabolic component.  LP not c/w infection, EEG without seizure
   activity.  MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no
   stenosis.
   - Following lytes
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase
   dilantin if falls <10.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Check urine if possible,
   # Fever: Likely [**2-18**] PNA in setting of witnessed aspiration event.
   Sputum with GPC in P/C/C, fever, WBC and RLL opacification on CXR.  LP,
   LFTs reassuring.  Blood cultures pending.  No urine.
   - Continue HAP treatment from [**10-3**] to end on [**10-10**] with Vanc, Zosyn,
   Cipro.  [**Month (only) 51**] narrow per sputum cx results.
   - Echo to r/o bacterial endocarditis.
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   - if no further acute change in MS, no need to re-image.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has
   been in normal range, and dropped to 80s w/ labetalol yesterday.
   - Continue w/ IV Labetalol , 5mg prn for SBPs>160
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: BS around 200s, but normal when NPO.    Required 28 U
   coverage yesterday
   - Hold oral hypoglycemics
   - SSI with q6 accu checks.
   - Start NPH at 10 U [**Hospital1 7**], hold for NPO
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet.  S/P HD yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and previous syncopal episode. She presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home, along with hypertension and seizure. She was intubated on [9-30] for MRI with the goal of extubation on [10-1] following LP under fluoroscopy, but unable to be removed from the vent for poor Respiratory System Blood Oxygenation Index (RSBI) and persistent decreased Mental Status (MS). She continues to have AMS (altered mental status), likely due to SDH/IPH with a superimposed toxic-metabolic component. The patient's fever is likely due to a healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), as evidenced by sputum culture showing Gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters. She has been on HAP treatment with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro since [10-3] to end on [10-10]. The patient also has a history of seizure, with EEG negative and already on phenytoin. Other possible etiologies include hypertensive emergency or infectious causes such as meningitis/encephalitis. She has a history of hypertension, temporally related to hemorrhage, although unclear if it preceded or followed the hemorrh"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventiliation:  Ventilation improving, but still requiring, on PS 10,
   PEEP 5, w/ RSBIs around 100, did not have previous respiratory failure,
   should be able to come off of vent. [**Month (only) 51**] have developing PNA w/ fever
   and RLL consolidation
   -continue following RSBIs, consider SBTs even with RSBIs>100,
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA
   -Consider extubation if MS improves after HD today.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, but showing slow improvement.  Most
   likely due to SDH/IPH.  Other etiologies include infectious,
   toxic-metabolic, seizure, CVA, sepsis. Most likely multifactorial.
   - MRI shows no interval change, no evidence of infarction, no midline
   shift, MRA shows no stenosis.
   - LP negative for pleocytosis
   - Too far out from seizure to be post-ictal
   - EEG did not show seizure activity, only encephalopathy- could be
   infectious or toxic-metabolic
   - Following lytes
   - Tox screen neg
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase
   dilantin if falls <10.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Check urine if possible,
   - MS may improve after HD
   # Fever:
   - Had a witnessed aspiration event and now ?new consolidation, ?edema
   vs PNA on CXR, not hypoxic.
   - Concern for meningitis/encephalitis, had LP w/ no WBCs.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Started empiric treatment for HAP w/ increasing fevers yesterday,
   Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro, sputum cx pending.
   - Sputum Gram stain: 4+ gram pos cocci in pars and clusters
   - Decreased fever after Abx started.
   - Check LFTs, [**Doctor First Name 354**], Lip to check for other locus of infection/abd
   process
   - Contact ID for Abx approval
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   - if no further acute change in MS, no need to re-image.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she

   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension, and seizure. She was intubated on [**9-30**] for MRI with the goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following lumbar puncture (LP) under fluoroscopy, unable to be removed from the ventilator for poor respiratory system compliance (RSBIs) and persistent decreased mental status (MS). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ventilation: Ventilation improving, but still requiring, on pressure support (PS) 10, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5, with RSBIs around 100, did not have previous respiratory failure, should be able to come off of vent. - Continue following RSBIs, consider spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) even with RSBIs >100, - elevate head of bed, - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Cipro for pneumonia (PNA).
2. AMS: Continues to have altered mental status (AMS), but showing slow improvement. Most likely due to SDH/IPH. Other etiologies include infectious, toxic-metabolic, seizure, cerebrovascular"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventilation:  Difficulty weaning from vent likely [**2-18**] PNA.  Continues
   to have unfavorable RSBIs [**2-18**] low tidal volume.  Requiring PS 10, PEEP
   5.
   -will do SBT with careful monitoring and ABG
 hr post.
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA.  Can d/c cipro once 48 hr with
   no GNR in sputum culture.
   -Continue to follow RSBI
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, likely due to SDH/IPH with a superimposed
   toxic-metabolic component.  LP not c/w infection, EEG without seizure
   activity.  MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no
   stenosis.
   - Following lytes
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with subdural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage after a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated on [9-30] for MRI and was unable to be extubated due to poor respiratory system bilinear indices (RSBIs) and persistent decreased mental status. She has been on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume, requiring PS 10, PEEP 5. A spontaneous breathing trial with careful monitoring and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will be conducted. 

The patient continues to have altered mental status likely due to subdural hematoma/intracerebral hemorrhage with a superimposed toxic-metabolic component. A lumbar puncture is not contraindicated, as EEG showed no seizure activity and MRI without evidence of infarction, with MRA showing no stenosis. Phenytoin levels are being monitored, with a goal between 10 and 20. If the level falls below 10, phenytoin will be increased. Sedating medications are being avoided as much as possible. 

The patient has a fever likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) in the setting of a witnessed aspiration event. Sputum culture results are pending, and blood cultures are pending. The patient is currently on vancom"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventilation:  Had difficulty weaning from vent likely [**2-18**] PNA.  Had
   unfavorable RSBIs [**2-18**] low tidal volume.  Requiring PS 10, PEEP 5, was
   extubated yesterday, and continued to have shallow breathing, but has
   had good O2 saturation since and O2 has been weaned down to 3L NC with
   Sats in the 97-100
   -ABG post extubation as above.
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA.  Sputum Cx grew small numbers
   GNR in sputum culture. Continue all three until culture and
   sensitivities on the gram neg rods result.
   -Continue to wean O2.
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, likely due to SDH/IPH with a superimposed
   toxic-metabolic component.  LP not c/w infection, EEG without seizure
   activity.  MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no
   stenosis.
   - Following lytes
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Dilantin today
   subtherapeutic at 9.1, will add 100mg bolus, continue the 125mg PO TID.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Mental status improving significantly, awake, alert, oriented as
   above. Continue to assess. Re-imaging worsening or acute change.
   # Fever: Likely [**2-18**] PNA in setting of witnessed aspiration event.
   Sputum with GPC in P/C/C, fever, WBC and RLL opacification on CXR.  LP,
   LFTs reassuring.  Blood cultures pending.  No urine.
   - Continue HAP treatment from [**10-3**] to end on [**10-10**] with Vanc, Zosyn,
   Cipro.  [**Month (only) 51**] narrow per sputum cx results.
   - Would consider echo if fevers not resolving or (+) cultures but low
   suspicion for endocarditis given evidence for PNA.
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   -Neuro recs
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   - Per Neurosurgery recommendation, if no acute change, would re-image
   w/ CT-HEAD in 1 month and would restart Heparin SQ prophylaxis for DVT
   now that bleed is stable.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has
   been in normal range, and dropped to 80s w/ labetalol yesterday.
   - Continue w/ IV Labetalol , 5mg prn for SBPs>160
   - Start Labetalol 100mg PO BID, per Renal recs. Hold for SBP < 120,
   titrate down if necessary on the floor.
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: BS around 200s, but normal when NPO.    Required 28 U
   coverage yesterday
   - Hold oral hypoglycemics
   - SSI with q6 accu checks.
   - Start NPH at 10 U [**Hospital1 7**], hold for NPO
   # ESRD: on HD, followed by renal.
   - continue cinacalcet
   - HD per renal
   - Renal recs from [**2113-10-5**]: HD w2.5kg removed, cx from HD catheter.
   Start PO labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] for BP control, titrate down if needed.
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG tube in place, reestart TFs at same as previous w/
   recs from Nutrtion.
   -Speech and swallow consult for eval before starting PO.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, Ranitidine, Heparin SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after experiencing a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated for MRI and remained on the ventilator due to poor respiratory status and decreased mental status. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics for pneumonia (PNA), antiepileptic drugs, and hypertensive medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/54 mmHg to 161/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border, and some diffuse left-sided weakness.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the sputum culture grew small numbers of gram-negative rods. Imaging studies reveal consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung and no evidence of infarction on MRI.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with h/o esrd on hd, dm, pvd who presented with SDH and IPH
   after a syncopal episode at home, hypertension and seizure.  Intubated
   on [**9-30**] for MRI with goal of extubation on [**10-1**] following LP under
   fluoro, unable to be removed from vent for poor RSBIs and persistent
   decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1743**].
   # Ventilation:  Difficulty weaning from vent likely [**2-18**] PNA.  Continues
   to have unfavorable RSBIs [**2-18**] low tidal volume.  Requiring PS 10, PEEP
   5.
   -will do SBT with careful monitoring and ABG
 hr post.
   -elevate head of bed
   -Continue Vanc, Zosyin, Cipro for PNA.  Can d/c cipro once 48 hr with
   no GNR in sputum culture.
   -Continue to follow RSBI
   # AMS: Continues to have AMS, likely due to SDH/IPH with a superimposed
   toxic-metabolic component.  LP not c/w infection, EEG without seizure
   activity.  MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no
   stenosis.
   - Following lytes
   - Follow dilantin level.  Goal between 10 and 20.  Today 10.3. Increase
   dilantin if falls <10.
   - Avoid sedating meds as much as possible
   - Check urine if possible,
   # Fever: Likely [**2-18**] PNA in setting of witnessed aspiration event.
   Sputum with GPC in P/C/C, fever, WBC and RLL opacification on CXR.  LP,
   LFTs reassuring.  Blood cultures pending.  No urine.
   - Continue HAP treatment from [**10-3**] to end on [**10-10**] with Vanc, Zosyn,
   Cipro.  [**Month (only) 51**] narrow per sputum cx results.
   - Would consider echo if fevers not resolving or (+) cultures but low
   suspicion for endocarditis given evidence for PNA.
   # Seizure: No known history of seizure, EEG was neg, but was already on
   Dilantin at time of study.  Most likely [**2-18**] SDH/IPH.  Other possible
   etiologies include hypertensive emergency (BPs 180s at time of seizure)
   or infectious (i.e. meningitis/encephalitis).
   -Follow dilantin levels
   -Neuro recs
   # SDH/IPH: Likely traumatic given fall though also possible [**2-18**]
   hypertension given newly elevated BP in house. Stable by imaging.
   - if no further acute change in MS, no need to re-image.
   # Hypertension: Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if
   preceeded or followed hemorrhage. Relatively significant increase from
   her documented baseline of 130-150 though given pvd and dm it is
   reasonable to think her arteries are generally less compliant so she
   would have hypertensive response with relatively less stimulation.
   Regardless requires improved control given seizure at SBP 180. BP has
   been in normal range, and dropped to 80s w/ labetalol yesterday.
   - Continue w/ IV Labetalol , 5mg prn for SBPs>160
   # Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5
   - Restarted methimazole on [**10-1**].
   - Unlikely to be cause of current issues; but important to consider if
   no other cause arises
   # Diabetes: BS around 200s, but normal when NPO.    Required 28 U
   coverage yesterday
   - Hold oral hypoglycemics
   - SSI with q6 accu checks.
   - Start NPH at 10 U [**Hospital1 7**], hold for NPO
   # ESRD: on HD, continue cinacalcet.  S/P HD yesterday
   - HD per renal
   # CAD: holding aspirin as above but continue atorvastatin.
   #: Nutrition: NG tube in place, TFs w/ recs from [**Last Name (LF) 1732**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   continue.
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, Ranitidine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated for an MRI and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She has been in the ICU since then.

The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia (PNA), aspiration, seizure, SDH/IPH, hypertension, toxic multinodular goiter, diabetes mellitus, ESRD, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She has been treated with various antibiotics for her PNA and GNRs in her sputum culture. Her current medications include ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and dilantin.

She continues to have rapid shallow breathing (RSBIs) and an unfavorable Mental Status (MS). Her vital signs are generally stable, but she has had fluctuations in blood pressure. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and troponin levels. The imaging studies reveal no evidence of infarction and no stenosis in the MRA.

The patient's current plan includes continuing HAP treatment, monitoring RSBIs, AMS, fever, seizure,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH) after a syncopal episode at home. She was intubated on [9-30] for an MRI with the goal of extubation on [10-1] following a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy. She has been unable to be removed from the ventilator due to poor respiratory status (RSBI) and persistent decreased mental status (MS).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ventilation: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator likely due to pneumonia (PNA). She required positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She was extubated yesterday and continued to have rapid shallow breathing but maintained oxygen saturation (sats). ABG post-extubation showed pH 7.37, PaCO2 48, PaO2/FiO2 220.
   - Elevate head of bed
   - Continue Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Cipro for PNA. Sputum culture grew small numbers of gram-negative rods (GNRs).

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of subdural hematoma/intracerebral hemorrhage (SDH/IPH) and seizures. She has been in the ICU and has had complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ongoing encephalopathy. The patient has tolerated extubation and her encephalopathy has been improving over the past couple of days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture showed Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating a possible infection. VAP is a common complication in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time. It can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential spread of the infection to other organs.

2. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures increases the risk of recurrent seizures. Seizures can be caused by the underlying brain injury or the development of new brain lesions. They can lead to further neurological deterioration and may require ongoing antiepileptic medication.

3. Subdural hematoma/intracerebral hemorrhage (SDH/IPH): The patient's initial presentation with SDH/IPH indicates a serious neurological condition. Although her encephalopathy has been improving, there is still a risk of neurological decline due to ongoing brain injury or rebleeding. Monitoring for changes in mental status or neurological"
