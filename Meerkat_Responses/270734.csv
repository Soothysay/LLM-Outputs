   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old female with a history of PVD, bladder
   cancer, a fib, ESRD who presents with persistent vaginal bleeding.
   .
   # Vaginal bleeding: Based on history the patient was reported to lose a
   significant amount of blood.  Initial repeat hct stable at 29
   yesterday, but then given one unit for HCT 23.8, now bumped to 25.1.
   Based on CT scan the patient has eroding bladder mass that is causing
   bleeding.
   - PM HCT
   -Patient to have cystoscopy today.
   # Tachycardia/hypotension: Tachcardia improving with blood, hypotension
   likely secondary to blood loss, though the patient with low blood
   pressures as outpatient.  Other potential causes could include
   infection, anxiety, pain.  Given that the patient is a dialysis patient
   with severe PVD the wide pulse pressure is expected.
   - trend hct
   - IVF bolus prn (though would prefer not to give boluses unless needed
   given that the patient is dialysis dependent).
   .
   # Bladder cancer: Diagnosed this year, seen by urology recently and
   unable to complete a cystoscopy.  There is not a tissue diagnosis at
   this point and the patient does not have any recollection that she has
   a bladder cancer.
   - urology to do cystoscopy
   - support blood volume as above
   .
   # PVD/ s/p debridement: wound appears to be healing with good
   granulation tissue and minimal evidence for infection.  Will have wound
   care evaluate the patient in AM.  Will consider plastics consult if
   worsening. Holding aspirin for now given
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: patient is rate controlled without meds
   currently.  Given the patient's hypotension, will not add betablockers
   at this time, but will add back when bleeding stable.  Not currently on
   anticoagulation
   .
   # Diabetes: patient reports having diet controlled diabetes.  Will give
   patient insulin sliding scale at this point and diabetic diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of PVD, bladder cancer, a fib, and ESRD. She presents with persistent vaginal bleeding. The patient has received blood transfusions to manage her low hemoglobin levels. She also has impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, hypotension, bladder cancer, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's history of significant blood loss and eroding bladder mass causing bleeding indicates a high risk for further bleeding complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures as an outpatient and the possibility of infection, anxiety, or pain contributing to hypotension suggest potential complications related to blood pressure instability.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to factors such as inadequate fluid balance, medication errors, or infections.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of wound infections, pressure ulcers, and compromised tissue viability.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, if not adequately managed with rate control and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Diabetes: Poor glycemic control in the ICU setting can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, both of which require prompt management.

   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old female with a history of PVD, bladder
   cancer, a fib, ESRD who presents with persistent vaginal bleeding.
   .
   # Vaginal bleeding: Based on history the patient was reported to lose a
   significant amount of blood.  Initial repeat hct stable at 29
   yesterday, but then given one unit for HCT 23.8, now bumped to 25.1.
   Based on CT scan the patient has eroding bladder mass that is causing
   bleeding.
   - PM HCT
   -Patient to have cystoscopy today.
   # Tachycardia/hypotension: Tachcardia improving with blood, hypotension
   likely secondary to blood loss, though the patient with low blood
   pressures as outpatient.  Other potential causes could include
   infection, anxiety, pain.  Given that the patient is a dialysis patient
   with severe PVD the wide pulse pressure is expected.
   - trend hct
   - IVF bolus prn (though would prefer not to give boluses unless needed
   given that the patient is dialysis dependent).
   .
   # Bladder cancer: Diagnosed this year, seen by urology recently and
   unable to complete a cystoscopy.  There is not a tissue diagnosis at
   this point and the patient does not have any recollection that she has
   a bladder cancer.
   - urology to do cystoscopy
   - support blood volume as above
   .
   # PVD/ s/p debridement: wound appears to be healing with good
   granulation tissue and minimal evidence for infection.  Will have wound
   care evaluate PND.  Will consider plastics consult if worsening.
   Holding aspirin for now given
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: patient is rate controlled without meds
   currently.  Given the patient's hypotension, will not add betablockers
   at this time, but will add back when bleeding stable.  Not currently on
   anticoagulation
   .
   # Diabetes: patient reports having diet controlled diabetes.  Will give
   patient insulin sliding scale at this point and diabetic diet.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bladder cancer, a fib, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and persistent vaginal bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with the following assessment and plan:

1. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which is evident from the lab results showing elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. This condition may require ongoing management and possibly dialysis.

2. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to blood loss, infection, anxiety, or pain. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood volume and blood pressure.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has large ulcers on her lower extremities with necrotic areas. These ulcers may require wound care evaluation and possible plastics consult if they worsen. The patient's extremities are also described as warm but with faint pulses.

4. Vaginal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing significant blood loss due to an eroding bladder mass. A cystoscopy has been planned to further evaluate and manage this condition.

5. Tachycardia/hypotension: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be a compensatory response to hypotension. It is important to monitor the heart rate and blood pressure closely.

The patient underwent cystoscopy with partial removal of a tumor that was said to invade the bladder wall, with the pathology report pending.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 107/60 mmHg to 73/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, specifically bilateral lower extremities dressed with gauze, diminished pedal pulses bilaterally, and no other complaints. The patient also has renal failure, chronic hypertension, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are also within normal limits.
