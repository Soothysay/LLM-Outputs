","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal and back pain, who presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient was found to have colitis on CT scan and now has ileus/small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status (AMS) with a variable course during their stay, likely multifactorial including narcotics, toxic/metabolic related to renal failure. The AMS appears to be consistent with delirium. The patient had a CT head with contrast on [**3-17**], but it did not definitively rule out brain metastases. The neurologic exam is nonfocal. The BUN has improved over the last 10 days.

The patient is on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires renal recommendations. They are also on Calcitriol and epo per renal recommendations.

The patient has lower extremity weakness, which underwent workup for cord compression, including a spine consult. It was not felt to be related to cord compression. It is likely related to deconditioning, pain, lethargy from?toxic/metabolic. There may be a possibility of myopathy. The patient should continue"

The patient is on sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for decreased bowel sounds on the right side, hirsute rubra (HR), no murmurs or gallops, diffuse tenderness with guarding in the abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity (LE) edema. Neurological examination shows anosmia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, and chronic abdominal and back pain. The patient presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with colitis and transferred to the ICU for increased peritoneal dialysis (PD) requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and transient hypotension after Oxycontin dose suggest a possible delirium, which is likely multifactorial including narcotics, toxic/metabolic related to renal failure.
2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on PD due to ESRD. It is important to monitor renal function and follow renal recommendations.
3. Lower Extremity Weakness: The patient has undergone workup for cord compression, including spine consult. However, it is unlikely related to cord compression and may be due to deconditioning, pain, lethargy from toxic/metabolic causes, or paraneoplastic syndrome.
4. Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain, likely related to metastatic carcinoid, degenerative changes, and deconditioning. Pain management should be continued.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a history of right internal jugular (RI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction, metastatic carcinoid, and chronic abdominal and back pain. He presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension, and was found to have colitis on computed tomography (CT).

The patient's mental status has been variable during his stay, likely due to multiple factors including narcotics, toxic/metabolic related to renal failure. It appears to be most consistent with delirium. A CT head with contrast was performed on 3/17, but it did not definitively rule out brain metastases. The neurologic examination is nonfocal.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), requiring four exchanges at two-hour intervals daily. He also has lower extremity weakness, which underwent workup for possible cord compression. It is not felt to be related to cord compression. Likely related to deconditioning, chronic pain, lethargy from possible toxic/metabolic causes, or a paraneoplastic process. Physical therapy consult, pain control, and consideration of a neurology consult, electromyography (EMG), are recommended.

The patient has chronic back pain with sclerotic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar spine by CT and a lesion on the iliac bone by octreotide scan."

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), metastatic carcinoid, colitis with sepsis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), who presented with altered mental status (AMS), slight hypotension, and abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/60 to 71/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on peritoneal dialysis with q2h exchanges, and blood cultures were obtained at 03:30 PM on [**2145-3-22**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on PD. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust the PD regimen accordingly.
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient presented with a pre-existing sacral decubitus ulcer. Proper wound care and turning should be continued to prevent further complications.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient exhibits signs of AMS, which could be related to oxycontin use. It is essential to avoid long-acting medications and continue providing Tylenol and Dilaudid as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), metastatic carcinoid, colitis with sepsis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), who presented with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, abdominal pain, and a decubitus ulcer.

24-hour events include transient hypotension that resolved after administration of normal saline (NS), stopping oxycontin due to AMS, planning a family meeting, and obtaining blood cultures.

Vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), current temperature 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate 81 bpm with a range of 55-84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/60 mmHg to 164/120 mmHg, respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute with a range of 10-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination findings include conjunctival pallor, normocephalic head, symmetrical chest expansion with crackles at the left base, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present and tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with guarding, cyanosis in the extremities, and no skin assessment.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 6.7 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) 388 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) 6.9 mg/dL, glucose 101 mg/dL, potassium (K+) 30 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) 139 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 27.6%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 7.0 mmol/L, and lactate 1.7 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include hypoxemia, renal failure (ESRD), decubitus ulcer, delirium/confusion, abdominal pain possibly due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and metastatic carcinoid.

Interventions include avoiding long-acting medications, continuing standing acetaminophen and dilaudid as needed for AMS, discussing PD frequency (4-6 times per day), administering calcitriol and epogen for ESRD, evaluating and treating abdominal pain, addressing the progression of metastatic carcinoid, managing CAD with ASA, statin, and metoprolol, and providing wound care for the sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels may lead to tissue damage or organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Renal Failure (ESRD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to further deterioration in renal function.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The existing decubitus ulcer has the potential to worsen and cause infection or deeper tissue damage if not properly managed with regular turning and wound care.
4. Delirium/Confusion: If left untreated, delirium may progress, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
5. Abdominal Pain: If the cause of abdominal pain, such as C. diff or ischemic colitis, is not appropriately identified and treated, it may lead to complications like sepsis or perforation.
6. Metastatic Carcinoid: The progression of carcinoid may result in further complications affecting multiple organ systems.
7. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Poor management of CAD may lead to cardiac events or worsening of the patient's cardiovascular status.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional assessments may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation."
