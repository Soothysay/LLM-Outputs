","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who recently developed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient presents with fever, hypoxia, and lethargy. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen central line in place. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.7°C (96.2°F). 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. The arterial blood gas reveals respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient is being treated for suspected sepsis with antibiotics and is also being evaluated for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other concerns include altered mental status, ECG changes, HIT, ESRD, respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, progression of respiratory failure, further deterioration in mental status, development of bleeding due to HIT, and complications related to ESRD such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral below-knee amputation. She was recently diagnosed with CAP and is now experiencing fever, hypoxia, and lethargy. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and respiratory acidosis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, likely originating from a pulmonary source. She is receiving appropriate therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).
2. HCAP: The patient has HCAP, which needs to be evaluated further with sputum culture and DFA testing.
3. ECG changes: The patient has lateral ST depression, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Troponin-T levels should be trended.
4. HIT +: The patient has a positive Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody test. PTT is elevated (>150), so the heparin should be held, and alternative anticoagulation should be considered.
5. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or hemodialysis.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient had resolved respiratory acidosis but is now experiencing worsening respiratory compromise. She is"

   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.
   - fem line in place
   - LR IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>65; may need increased MAP if
   improved mental status observed with higher BP
   - check CvO2
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; ultrasound for evidence of tapable pleural
   effusion
   - stool for C diff
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].

   - send sputum cx
   - chest PT
   - Consider chest CT and thoracentesis in AM (would need FFP for
   supratherapeutic INR)
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu given daughters with similar symptoms
   .
   # AMS: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
   Hypercarbia also on differential.
   - check ABG
   - If no improvement with improved BP, consider CT head to r/o
   hemorrhage given elevated INR
   # ECG changes: Patient with ST depressions in I aVL and V4-V6 with
   TWI.  First trop was 0.20 which is her baseline in setting of ESRD.
   Not complaining of chest pain although currently poor historian
   - cycle CE
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
   - trend coags
   .
   # Acidosis: Anion gap metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis. Also
   respiratory acidosis with ddx hypoventilation (no known COPD), dead
   space ventilation, hypermetabolic
   - Recheck ABG, lactate
   - bicarb if pH worsening
   - LR for IVF boluses prn
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema.
   - f/u renal recs re: HD v. CVVH
   - bicarb replacement if pH <7.2
   - continue sevelamir
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   .
   # A-fib with RVR: HR low 100s (baseline tachycardia) as holding metop
   in setting of hypotension
   - IVF first. If persistantly tachy, consider amio bolus.
   - obtain record of TTE
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has multiple comorbidities including septic shock, pneumonia, acute mental status change, ECG changes, HIT, acidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation of tachycardia, fever, and hypotension suggests septic shock. She has been on treatment with vancomycin and cefepime, but the source of infection is still unclear. Possible infectious etiologies include pulmonary, meningitis, urinary tract, or gastrointestinal sources. Monitoring vital signs, fluid balance, and daily blood cultures is crucial.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has an LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray and bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen. She has been treated with levofloxacin since 7/23 but may require further intervention. Sending sputum culture, performing chest PT, and considering a chest CT and thoracentesis are necessary.

3. Acute Mental Status Change (AMS): The patient's altered mental status could be due to hypoperfusion in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.
   - fem line in place
   - LR IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at baseline,
   so decreased MAP goal
   - will do good fluid challenge today if possible
   - continue Vanc/cefepime/flagyl per ID recs
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; ultrasound for evidence of tapable pleural
   effusion
   - stool for C diff
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above
   - send sputum cx, pseudomonas growing
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.  Wean from AC
   to PS if tolerating today.
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 today in setting of coumadin and
   antibiotic therapy
   - trend INR
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP is starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   # ECG changes: Patient with ST depressions in I aVL and V4-V6 with
   TWI.  First trop was 0.20 which is her baseline in setting of ESRD.
   Not complaining of chest pain although currently poor historian
   - cycle Ces, negative so far
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   .
   # Acidosis: Anion gap metabolic acidosis improving
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH
   - bicarb replacement if pH <7.2, see renal recs
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   .
   # A-fib with RVR: HR low 100s (baseline tachycardia) as holding metop
   in setting of hypotension
   - IVF first. If persistantly tachy, consider amio bolus.
   - obtain record of TTE
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations.
- She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray.
- She was initially treated for suspected septic shock and pneumonia.
- The patient's condition deteriorated, and she required intubation due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
- She is currently receiving aggressive treatment for sepsis and pneumonia, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroidism.
- She has a supratherapeutic INR due to coumadin and antibiotic therapy, and there is concern for bleeding complications.
- The patient's family has been informed about her critical condition and code status.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and signs of infection, suggesting sepsis. Her condition has worsened despite aggressive treatment, indicating a high risk of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: Due to the progression of pneumonia, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and bilateral above-knee amputations. He was admitted with a recent diagnosis of CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) and now presents with fever, hypoxia, and lethargy. The patient is currently in septic shock, likely secondary to pulmonary sources, and is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). He requires ongoing resuscitation with IV fluids and titration of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. An echocardiogram should be checked, and femoral line re-siting may be considered if prolonged pressor need is anticipated. Antibiotic therapy consists of vancomycin and cefepime, with metronidazole to be discontinued today. Vancomycin dosing and levels should be monitored. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and effusion, for which weaning strategies such as pressure support ventilation (PSV) and daily awakening trials should be considered. There are ECG changes including lateral ST depression, and cardiac enzymes should be trended. The patient has HIT and a PTT greater than 150; rechecking PTT and holding coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.0 is necessary. The patient may require continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with bicarbonate replacement"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She was recently diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is now presenting with fever, ongoing hypoxia, and lethargy. The patient is currently in septic shock, likely due to a pulmonary source, and is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). She requires IV fluid resuscitation and titration of vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). An echocardiogram is needed to assess cardiac function. The patient's femoral line will be kept for now but may need re-siting if prolonged pressor need is required.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and effusion. Weaning from mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously, with periodic spontaneous breathing trials. Daily awakening trials should be performed. There are ECG changes, specifically lateral ST depression, and a troponin-T level of 0.14. A cardiac echo should be performed to evaluate for ischemia or infarction.

The patient has HIT, with a PTT greater than 150. The PTT should be rechecked, and Coumadin should be held. The goal INR is 2.5-3.0. The patient's ESR"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral above-knee amputations. She was admitted with suspected pneumonia and sepsis, and now presents with fever, ongoing hypoxia, and lethargy. The patient is critically ill and currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. She is also on vasopressors for septic shock, which is likely of pulmonary origin. The source of infection is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, but no organisms have been recovered yet from microbiology.

The patient's INR remains supratherapeutic, indicating a potential bleeding risk due to over-anticoagulation. Efforts are being made to wean off vasopressors and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient's femoral line is being kept for now but may need to be re-sited if prolonged pressor use is required.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, with plans to hold on oral glucose tolerance testing (OGT) due to coagulopathy. Blood sugar levels are well-controlled. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include septic shock due to a possible pulmonary infection, hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation with rapid"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive requiring levo.
   - fem line in place, will need to think about replacing line
   - NS IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at baseline,
   so decreased MAP goal, will continue to be aggressive with D5NS today
   and trying to wean pressor
   - challenged with fluid boluses yesterday and slighty decrease in
   levofed dosage, but still not much response, good response in
   tachycardia, though; consider allowing lower MAPs in setting of chronic
   low BPs at home
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 3
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today
   .
   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo today to assess for cardiomyopathy in setting of sepsis vs.
   hypotension secondary to cardiac shock
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP is starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   - consider reversal with FFP tomorrow to resite line and possibly place
   OG tube
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped overnight because Ca
   increasing and ionized Ca decreasing, with hypomag and
   hypophosphetemia; considering citrate toxicity as a cause
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor q6hr labs
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia), ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease) on HD (Hemodialysis), and s/p bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on CXR. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a diagnosis of septic shock secondary to pneumonia. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/49 mmHg to 63/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight is currently 56.1 kg, compared to her admission weight of 53.2 kg.

The patient has received several interventions and treatments, including fluid boluses, CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis), antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, Cefepime), and anticoagulation therapy. She has also undergone imaging studies such as a chest X-ray and CT abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.3 K"

- The patient, a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis), and bilateral above-knee amputations, presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on CXR (chest X-ray).
- She was diagnosed with septic shock, likely of pulmonary origin, and has been receiving IV fluids and pressors to maintain MAP (mean arterial pressure) above 60.
- The patient also has pneumonia, with a LLL (left lower lobe) infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen.
- She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, and cultures are pending.
- The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, for which she was intubated.
- Her heart rhythm has been alternating between sinus tachycardia around 100 bpm and atrial fibrillation with rates around 110-120 bpm, and she has been responsive to fluids.
- The patient's INR (international normalized ratio) was elevated at 10.8, possibly due to coumadin and antibiotic therapy, but it is coming down.
- She has a history of HIT, which complicated her clinical course and required avoidance of heparin products.

Other possible infectious etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, or gastrointestinal source.

2. Pneumonia: The LLL infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray indicates pneumonia. The patient has been on treatment with levofloxacin since July 23rd. It is recommended to continue vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl as per infectious disease recommendations. Sputum culture should be sent, and pseudomonas growing should be considered. Chest PT and DFA for flu-negative should also be done.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is now intubated secondary to pneumonia. Weaning from assisted control (AC) to pressure support (PS) should be attempted if the patient tolerates it today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The 24-hour events include stopping flagyl, INR plateauing at 10.8 and then down to 10.6, experiencing a short SVT, continuing CVVH, changing vancomycin and cefepime dosing per CVVH protocol, giving fluid bolus trials, and stopping CVVH due to rising Ca but falling ionized Ca (likely due to citrate toxicity). 

The patient has allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and bee pollens. The last doses of antibiotics administered were piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36C (96.8F), a heart rate of 103 bpm (with a range of 92-112 bpm), blood pressure readings varying between 84/49 mmHg and 106/67 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-29 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rates around 110-120 beats per minute"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral above-knee amputations (AKA). She was recently diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is now experiencing presumed septic shock. 

The patient is currently on appropriate therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and has an effusion that is not amenable to thoracentesis. She is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and remains pressor-dependent. 

Her vital signs include a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 71/41 to 106/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 216 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and elevated troponin"

   I was physically present with the MICU housestaff team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments: [**Age over 90 323**] yo female with afib, ESRD on HD, hx HIT admitted
   with sepsis /PNA, with septic shock and acute respiratory failure.
   Minimal change in level of pressor requirements over the past day. She
   may still be under-resuscitated, though her renal failure and our
   inability to obtain a CVP [**Location (un) 308**] make it difficult to assess her
   volume status. Will continue her on AC ventilation for acute resp.
   failure, wean vent as tolerated, continue antibiotics, give additional
   IVF in an attempt to reduce pressor needs, and re-assess LV function
   with echo. Remains hypercoagulopathic precluding change in CVL.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. She was admitted with sepsis/pneumonia and is currently experiencing presumed septic shock. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic shock: The source of infection is likely pulmonary, and the patient is receiving appropriate therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Effusion is not amenable to thoracentesis. The patient should continue intravenous fluid resuscitation, especially off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), to target pressor requirements as a goal. Titrate off vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60. Check for an echo and keep femoral line for now but consider re-siting if prolonged pressor need.

2. HCAP: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin + cefepime) are being administered. Vancomycin dosing has been changed back to hemodynamic dosing.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is due to pneumonia and effusion as mentioned above. Weaning of ventilation should be done as mental status allows and consider a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV).

4. Coagulopathy: Elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) is related to antibiotic"

The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of severe aortic stenosis and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient has been sedated and intubated, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support.

24-hour events:
- Ultrasound of the right upper arm was performed, which showed no deep vein thrombosis.
- Transthoracic echo was conducted, revealing severe aortic stenosis, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, mildly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis, and depressed cardiac index. The left atrium is moderately dilated, and there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
- The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and cefepime, and aspirin was stopped.
- Despite receiving 3.5 liters of D5NS boluses, the patient remains on 0.08 mcg/kg/min of levophed.
- Tissue Doppler imaging suggests increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP > 18 mmHg).
- There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
- Compared to the prior study, left ventricular systolic function has declined, and the severity of aortic stenosis has significantly progressed.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive requiring levo.
   - fem line in place, will need to think about replacing line
   - NS IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at baseline,
   so decreased MAP goal, will continue to be aggressive with D5NS today
   and trying to wean pressor
   - challenged with fluid boluses yesterday and slighty decrease in
   levofed dosage, but still not much response, good response in
   tachycardia, though; consider allowing lower MAPs in setting of chronic
   low BPs at home
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 3
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #heart failure-as evidenced on yesterday
s echo. Severe AS and
   biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection vs.
   cardiac process.
   -consider change in pressor
   -
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today
   .
   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo today to assess for cardiomyopathy in setting of sepsis vs.
   hypotension secondary to cardiac shock
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP is starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   - consider reversal with FFP tomorrow to resite line and possibly place
   OG tube
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped overnight because Ca
   increasing and ionized Ca decreasing, with hypomag and
   hypophosphetemia; considering citrate toxicity as a cause
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor q6hr labs
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis), and previous bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on CXR. 

She has been diagnosed with septic shock, pneumonia, heart failure, and respiratory failure. Her initial treatment included antibiotics (Vanco/cefepime), fluid boluses, and vasopressors (Levofed). She also received a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) that showed severe aortic stenosis and severe global left ventricular systolic function.

She has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and a past NSTEMI. Her labs show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelets. Her coagulation profile is abnormal with an elevated INR due to the use of Coumadin and antibiotic therapy.

She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and intubated. Her blood cultures have not shown any growth to date. She has been treated with antifungals and antibiotics, and her chest PT has been ordered.

Her current medications include IV fluids, antibiotics, vasopressors, and other ICU medications. She is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration"

   - RUE U/s- negative for DVT
   - Echo:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
   thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Severe global left ventricular
   systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with global
   hypokinesis. Depressed cardiac index.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-7**], left
   ventricular systolic function has declined. The severity of aortic
   stenosis has significantly progressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral above-knee amputations (AKA). She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She also has tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Her INR is elevated due to coumadin and antibiotic therapy. She has a history of HIT, which complicated by thrombus in both lower extremities requiring amputations. She is on CVVH, stopped overnight because of increasing calcium levels and decreasing ionized calcium, with hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia, considering citrate toxicity as a cause. Her left hand is swollen with white fingers, which has improved, but her right hand is still swollen. She has a history of NSTEMI in 2014. She is also diagnosed with hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray suggests a possible infectious etiology, leading to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, lab parameters, and response to treatment is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure:"

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
   thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Severe global left ventricular
   systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with global
   hypokinesis. Depressed cardiac index.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-7**], left

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with severe aortic stenosis and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is significantly reduced at 20%, indicating impaired heart function. There is also moderate thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation. The right ventricle is mildly dilated with moderate global hypokinesis. The patient's cardiac index is depressed, suggesting reduced cardiac output.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (BP) and elevated heart rate (HR). The respiratory support indicates the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows normal pH, slightly low carbon dioxide (CO2), and normal oxygen (O2) levels.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Kidney function tests reveal increased creatinine (Cr) levels, while blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results indicate elevated D-dimer levels, normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these findings include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Severe aortic stenosis and reduced cardiac output can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs, causing cardiogenic shock.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and impaired heart function increase the risk of developing arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Pulmonary edema: The impaired left ventricular function may result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.
4. End-organ damage: Reduced cardiac output may lead to ischemia and potential damage to vital organs such as the kidneys and brain.
5. Thromboembolic events: Despite the negative right upper extremity ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the patient's immobilization and impaired cardiac function increase the risk of developing DVT or pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of central lines increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Renal dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can be caused by decreased renal perfusion due to reduced cardiac output.

These are potential medical complications based on the provided information. It is important for the patient's healthcare team to closely monitor their condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these complications."

   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive requiring levo.
   - fem line in place, will need to think about replacing line, will
   likely do today.
   - D5NS IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at
   baseline, so decreased MAP goal, will continue to be aggressive with
   D5NS today and trying to wean pressor
   - challenged with fluid boluses yesterday and slighty decrease in
   levofed dosage, but still not much response, good response in
   tachycardia, though; consider allowing lower MAPs in setting of chronic
   low BPs at home
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 4
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff
   -will consider change to dopamine today as unclear if truly septic
   shock given no response to tx for this.
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #heart failure-as evidenced on yesterday
s echo. Severe AS and
   biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection vs.
   cardiac process.
   -consider change in pressor to dopamine
   -cardiology consult-will need to consider optimization of heart failure
   regimen if clnical picture consistent.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today
   .
   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo as above. INR supratherapeutic
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP if starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   - FFP today to resite line and place OGT.
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped overnight because Ca
   increasing and ionized Ca decreasing, with hypomag and
   hypophosphetemia; considering citrate toxicity as a cause
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor q6hr labs
   -will d/w renal re: plans for CVVH or HD
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath, no clot.
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   -will likely need optimization.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral below-knee amputations (AKA). She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She is also experiencing septic shock, severe aortic stenosis, biventricular failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which requires aggressive management with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs, blood cultures, and inflammatory markers to guide further treatment.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, as evidenced by the LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray and bilateral pleural effusion on lung cuts of CT abdomen. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and additional diagnostic tests such as sputum culture and DFA for flu should be done. Chest PT and O2 therapy should also be maintained to keep sats >93%.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure with an EF of"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and bilateral above-knee amputations. She was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 81/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 188 K/uL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 128 mg/dL, and potassium of 5.1 mEq/L.

The patient has undergone several tests, including an ultrasound that revealed no deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a trans-thoracic echo that showed severe aortic stenosis (AoS) with global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVHK), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, and increased left ventricular filling pressures.

   infectious organisms from micro cultures. Despite abx coverage, there
   has been no meaningful change in level of pressor requirements.
   1.       Shock: Initial impression was for septic +/-hypovolemic shock-
   has been treated with fluids and abx but unable to significantly reduce
   pressors, with concern that sepsis may not fully explain her
   hypotension
   -On vanc and cefipime
 continue to follow up micro data
   -Check cortisol level
   -levophed to maintain MAP>60
   - Will back off on further fluid resuscitation, and check a CVP and
   central venous sat once new CVL established

   significant cardiogenic component
   - will begin restricting IVF, check CVP once CVL re-sited
   - Cardiology consult
   -Not on afterload reduction due to hypotension

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted with hypotension attributed to presumed pneumonia/sepsis. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors, there has been no improvement in her condition. 

The patient's current medical complications include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), pneumonia (community-acquired), ineffective coping, hospital-acquired pneumonia (non-ventilator-associated), thrombocytopenia (heparin-induced), pleural effusion (acute), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and renal failure (end-stage).

The assessment and plan include:
1. Shock: The patient is being treated for septic +/- hypovolemic shock. Pressor requirements have not decreased significantly despite fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy. Further evaluation is needed, including checking cortisol levels, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 with levophed, and monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) once a central venous line (CVL) is established.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient's recent echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis. This may contribute to her shock. Restricting intravenous fluids, checking CVP, and consulting cardiology are recommended."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and bilateral above-knee amputations. She was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure.

The patient has been treated for sepsis and pneumonia but remains pressor-dependent. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, ineffective coping, pleural effusion, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient has been treated for sepsis and pneumonia but continues to be pressor-dependent with minimal progress. She may develop further complications related to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.

2. Acute respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing apneic spells on pressure support ventilation (PSV), indicating potential respiratory muscle weakness or fatigue. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

3. Aortic stenosis: The echocardiogram findings suggest severe aortic stenosis. This condition can cause reduced cardiac output and contribute to shock, especially if the patient's hypotension has a significant cardiogenic component.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's elevated heart rate is relatively controlled but may still pose risks for thromboembolic events or arrhythmia-related complications.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a potential bleeding risk"

   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive on levophed.
   - fem line in place, unsuccessful attempt to place L.IJ yesterday.
   - Will attempt to wean off levophed today, accepting MaP 55, SBP ~80s.
   - challenged with fluid boluses recently  with no effect on clinical
   status/pressor requirement.
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 5
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff negative.
   -attempt to wean sedation and change to PSV
   -IR to attempt L.sided PICC today.
   -[**Last Name (un) 45**] stim today.
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #heart failure-as evidenced on yesterday
s echo. Severe AS and
   biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection vs.
   cardiac process. However, renal and pt
s son report that this echo
   findings are not new and were seen a few months ago at [**Hospital1 **].
   -consider change in pressor to dopamine if clinical status appears
   consistent with cardiogenic shock.
   -cardiology consult-suggested digoxin after extubation.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today
   .
   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo as above. INR supratherapeutic. Will consider digoxin.
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will start aggatroban today.
   - FFP yesterday to resite line and place OGT.
   .
   #anemia-pt with slight HCT drop this am. Likely secondary to blood loss
   during yesterday
s procedure/line placement.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   -guaiac stools.
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   -start argatroban today.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped overnight because Ca
   increasing and ionized Ca decreasing, with hypomag and
   hypophosphetemia; considering citrate toxicity as a cause
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor electrolytes.
   -will d/w renal re: plans for CVVH or HD
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath, no clot.
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   -will likely need optimization.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].
   - continue levothyroxine, change to IV as NPO

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi-lumen insertion. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and bee pollen. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

24-hour events include the insertion and removal of a multi-lumen, confirmation by Dr. [Last Name] that echo findings are not new, consultation with cardiology recommending dig for rate control after weaning and extubation, consideration of cardioversion for AFib if persistently hypotensive, administration of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), unsuccessful attempt to place left IJ central line, placement of orogastric tube, initiation of tube feeds, and measurement of cortisol level at 12.9.

Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.09 mcg/kg/min, fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient is on various medications for medical and family history changes. Review of systems is unchanged from admission.

   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive requiring levo.
   - fem line in place, will need to think about replacing line, will
   likely do today.
   - D5NS IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at
   baseline, so decreased MAP goal, will continue to be aggressive with
   D5NS today and trying to wean pressor
   - challenged with fluid boluses yesterday and slighty decrease in
   levofed dosage, but still not much response, good response in
   tachycardia, though; consider allowing lower MAPs in setting of chronic
   low BPs at home
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 4
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff
   -will consider change to dopamine today as unclear if truly septic
   shock given no response to tx for this.
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #heart failure-as evidenced on yesterday
s echo. Severe AS and
   biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection vs.
   cardiac process.
   -consider change in pressor to dopamine
   -cardiology consult-will need to consider optimization of heart failure
   regimen if clnical picture consistent.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today
   .
   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo as above. INR supratherapeutic
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP if starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   - FFP today to resite line and place OGT.
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for
   discusiion
   - trend coags
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped overnight because Ca
   increasing and ionized Ca decreasing, with hypomag and
   hypophosphetemia; considering citrate toxicity as a cause
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor q6hr labs
   -will d/w renal re: plans for CVVH or HD
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath, no clot.
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   -will likely need optimization.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Last TSH of 4.2 in 4/[**2143**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She is also experiencing septic shock, heart failure, and acute kidney injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated inflammatory markers suggest ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics, will be crucial to manage sepsis.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of ~20%. Close monitoring of cardiac function, optimization of heart failure regimen, and consideration of cardiac catheterization or surgical intervention may be required.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury should be closely monitored. Adjustments in fluid balance, electrolyte management, and consideration of renal replacement therapy (e.g., CVVH or HD) will be necessary based on the patient's"

   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive requiring levo.
   - fem line in place, will need to think about replacing line, will
   likely do today.
   - D5NS IVF boluses and pressors to keep MAP>60, has low BPs at
   baseline, so decreased MAP goal, will continue to be aggressive with
   D5NS today and trying to wean pressor
   - challenged with fluid boluses yesterday and slighty decrease in
   levofed dosage, but still not much response, good response in
   tachycardia, though; consider allowing lower MAPs in setting of chronic
   low BPs at home
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 4
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff
   -will consider change to dopamine today as unclear if truly septic
   shock given no response to tx for this.
   .
   # Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and bilateral plerual effusion
   seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on treatment with Levofloxacin since
   [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #heart failure-as evidenced on yesterday
s echo. Severe AS and
   biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection vs.
   cardiac process.
   -consider change in pressor to dopamine
   -cardiology consult-will need to consider optimization of heart failure
   regimen if clnical picture consistent.

   # Respiratory Failure
 secondary to PNA, now intubated.
    - has been doing well on AC, can consider sedation trial and possible
   wean to PS today

   # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around 100
   and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat repsonsive to
   fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but being held in
   setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as needed, can
   possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP improves.
   - echo as above. INR supratherapeutic
   .
   # Elevated INR
 INR to 10.8 peak in setting of coumadin and antibiotic
   therapy
   - trend INR, coming down
   - no evidence of bleeding clinically, will trend Hct
   - will reverse with FFP if starts to bleed or large hct drop
   - want to avoid reversal due to hx of HIT and would have to use
   argatroban to anticoagulate
   - FFP today to resite line and place OGT.
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given supratherapeutic level
 see above for

   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral above-knee amputations. She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. She was diagnosed with septic shock, pneumonia, acute pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The patient also has heart failure with severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure, as evidenced by an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. 

Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient presented tachycardic, febrile, and hypotensive, requiring levophed in the emergency department. She is still hypotensive requiring levo, with low blood pressures at baseline. There are multiple possible infectious etiologies, including a pulmonary source given the left lower lobe infiltrate, meningitis, urosepsis, or gastrointestinal source. 

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest X-ray and bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen. She has been on treatment with levofloxacin since 7/23, but no culture data to date. DFA for flu negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multi-lumen insertion, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, pleural effusion, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 65-88 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. The patient is receiving multiple medications for rate control, sedation, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The high positive pressure from mechanical ventilation can cause lung injury and potentially lead to barotrauma.
3. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmia and the"

   infectious organisms from micro cultures. Despite abx coverage, there
   has been no meaningful change in level of pressor requirements.
   1. Shock: intially felt to be related to sepsis but w/ echo showing
   severe AS and BiV failure making cardiogenic contribution likely. Also
   considering adrenal insuff.
   -goal MAP 55-60
   -Cosyntropin stim test today
   -attempt to place neck CVC unsuccessful, unable to transduce CVP/
   central venous O2 sat --> today will attempt IR, double-lumen PICC
   -ID mgmt as below

   I was present with the MICU housestaff team for the key portions of
   services provided, and independently examined the patient. I agree with
   the history, physical, assessment and plan as outlined by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 9152**] and would add:
   [**Age over 90 323**] yo female with CAD, ESRD on HD, PVD, and hx of HIT admitted with
   hypotension in the context of presumed PNA/sepsis, course also notable
   for ongoing hypotension requiring pressors, and acute respiratory
   failure. Seen by cardiology consult team with recommendations for
   digoxin to reduce ventricular rate. Aortic stenosis was a low-flow
   phenomenon secondary to depressed LVef/extensive CAD, which was not
   felt to be reversible as she would not tolerate revascularization/CABG.
   Prognosis from low flow aortic stenosis was noted to be poor.
   Her current problems include:
   *Acute respiratory failure from PNA and volume overload (ESRD +poor
   cardiac function)
   *hypotension, contributions from sepsis (presumably resolving) and
   cardiac. Pt
s BP
s also run low at home chronically. Need to evaluate
   adrenals
   *Hx of HIT, INR
s now subtherapeutic
   *ESRD
   Our goal is to optimize her resp status in hopes of getting her off the
   ventilator, but poor cardiac status, poor nutrition, weakness and ESRD
   will make this difficult.
   Plans:
   1.       Accept lower MAP goal given pt
s baseline
   2.       Pressors rather than fluid resuscitation to maintain goal MAP
   3.       Enteral feeds started
   4.       Wean sedation
   5.       SBT
s as tolerated (currently becomes apneic)
   6.       Fluid removal as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (renal)
   7.       Move to possible extubation in the next 2-3 days if
   appropriate progress made. Her son has been extensively involved in her
   care and wishes to be present at extubation
   Family conference held this afternoon with MICU team (Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9152**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1162**]), SW, son and daughter to discuss her guarded outlook and
   immediate plans. All agreed that the goal was to get her well enough
   such that she could return home to the care of her family. They
   recognize that with her multiple medical conditions, this may not be
   possible, in which case we will  need to re-discuss her long term
   wishes.
   Input from cardiology and renal appreciated.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent on pt: 70 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia (PNA)/sepsis. 

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but there has been no recovery of infectious organisms from micro cultures. Despite antibiotic coverage, there has been no meaningful change in the level of pressor requirements. 

The patient's current medical conditions include shock (initially felt to be related to sepsis but now considering cardiogenic contribution), severe aortic stenosis (AS), bilateral ventricular failure (BiV failure), acute respiratory failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation with controlled rate, and HIT/elevated INR. 

The patient's goals of care include optimizing her respiratory status in hopes of getting her off the ventilator, addressing hypotension, managing anemia, treating atrial fibrillation, and evaluating for adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory status leading to respiratory failure, worsening of hypotension and shock, progression of anemia, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, and potential complications related to HIT/elevated INR. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and pressor support, there has been no meaningful change in her condition. The patient's current medical conditions include shock (initially thought to be related to sepsis, but now suspected to have a cardiogenic contribution due to severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure), acute respiratory failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), elevated INR, ESRD, and social issues related to her hospital course and further goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure.
2. Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Anemia requiring blood transfusions.
4. Atrial fibrillation with potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. HIT with the risk of thrombosis or bleeding.
6. Elevated INR due to anticoagulation therapy.
7. ESRD requiring ongoing renal replacement therapy.
8. Social issues related to family meetings and discussions about the patient's hospital course and further goals of care."

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of being unable to wean from the assisted ventilation (AC) due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), pneumonia, ineffective coping, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's current medications include argatroban, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and low-dose digoxin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/50 mmHg to 96/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg and fluid balance within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), along with elevated creatinine (Cr), lactic acid, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures from 07/30/2143 at 11:14 PM and 11:57 PM were positive for Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.23 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and s/p b/l AKA. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on CXR. She is diagnosed with septic shock, pneumonia, heart failure, and respiratory failure secondary to PNA. She also has elevated INR, anemia, and a history of CAD, hypothyroidism, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a bilateral pleural effusion and LLL infiltrate on CXR, indicating pneumonia. It is important to continue treatment with antibiotics and monitor for any worsening symptoms.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has severe AS and biventricular failure with an EF of 20%. This may be secondary to infection or a cardiac process. It is necessary to closely monitor her cardiac status and consider changes in pressor therapy if consistent with cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia. She has been intubated and is doing well on AC. Sedation trials and possible weaning to PSV should be considered.
4. Tachycardia/afib: The patient is alternating between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rates around 110-120s. Rate control should be maintained, and metoprolol can be considered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrates and effusion on chest X-ray. She is diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and pleural effusion. She has leukocytosis and is at risk for multiple sites of infection. She also has severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she has been started on argatroban due to HIT. She has anemia, likely secondary to blood loss during procedures, and her left hand is swollen with white fingers. She has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, and NSTEMI in 2014.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to severe ARDS if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's sepsis may worsen if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe AS and biventricular failure may lead"

   hypotension attributed to PNA/sepsis. She has been treated with broad
   spectrum abx and pressors for 4 days with no fevers, and no recovery of
   infectious organisms from micro cultures.
   1. Shock: intially felt to be related to sepsis but w/ echo showing
   severe AS and BiV failure making cardiogenic contribution likely.
   -goal MAP 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated
   -ID mgmt as below
   -CV mgmt as below
   2. Ao stenosis, BiV failure: migth benefit from some fluid removal.
   Already hypotensive so afterload reduction not an option
   -touch base w/ Renal re: resuming CVVH
   3. Acute respiratory failure: failed PSV due to rapid shallow breathing
   today, empiric course for VAP
   -re-eval for PSV trial after poss CVVH re-initiated
   -day 6 of vanco + cefepime, total 8d planned
   4. Atrial fibrillation- rate relatively controlled
   5. HIT/ Elevated INR- now subtherapeutic INR
   -in the context of HIT would start argatroban gtt, can stop for
   procedure
   -holding coumadin for now
   6. ESRD: Renal team following
   -would ask Renal team to re-eval for CVVH, without citrate as this led
   to lyte imbalances before
   7. Leukocytosis: panculture, otherwise vigilent monitoring for infxn

   Echo reveals low flow aortic stenosis and severe systolic CHF. Her
   major issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: needs further fluid removal and better
   mentation. Slightly more alert this morning, remains ventilator
   dependent with only transient tolerance of PSV. Will continue to wean

   2. Hypotension/shock, septic/cardiogenic: on levophed to maintain
   MAP>55. Decreased positive pressure ventilation may also improve
   hemodynamics once appropriate for extubation.
   3. Severe aortic stenosis/afib: digoxin load to reduce ventricular rate

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia (PNA) and sepsis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but there are no fevers and no recovery of infectious organisms from microbiology cultures.

The patient's current conditions and plan include:

1. Shock: Initially felt to be related to sepsis, but an echo showed severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure, making a cardiogenic contribution likely. Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated. ID management as below. CV management as below.
2. Aortic stenosis, biventricular failure: May benefit from some fluid removal. Already hypotensive, so afterload reduction not an option. Touch base with Renal re: resuming continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Acute respiratory failure: Failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to rapid shallow breathing today, empiric course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Re-evaluate for PSV trial after possible CVVH re-initiated. Day 6 of vancomycin and cefepime, total 8 days planned.

   severe AS and BiV failure making cardiogenic contribution likely.
   -goal MAP 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated
   -ID mgmt as below
   -CV mgmt as below
   2. Ao stenosis, BiV failure: migth benefit from some fluid removal.
   Already hypotensive so afterload reduction not an option
   -touch base w/ Renal re: resuming CVVH
   3. Acute respiratory failure: failed PSV due to rapid shallow breathing
   today, empiric course for VAP
   -re-eval for PSV trial after poss CVVH re-initiated
   -day 6 of vanco + cefepime, total 8d planned
   4. Atrial fibrillation- rate relatively controlled
   5. HIT/ Elevated INR- now subtherapeutic INR
   -in the context of HIT would start argatroban gtt, can stop for
   procedure
   -holding coumadin for now
   6. ESRD: Renal team following
   -would ask Renal team to re-eval for CVVH, without citrate as this led
   to lyte imbalances before

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 93-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis.
- She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but has not shown improvement or recovery of infectious organisms from cultures.
- The patient's condition remains critical, and several medical complications have arisen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: Initially believed to be related to sepsis, but an echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular failure, indicating a cardiogenic contribution to the shock.
- Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 55-60, and the levophed should be weaned as tolerated.
- Infection management and cardiac management are ongoing.

2. Aortic Stenosis and Biventricular Failure: The patient might benefit from fluid removal.
- Afterload reduction is not an option due to hypotension.
- Contact the renal team regarding resuming continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to rapid shallow breathing today.
- An empiric course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated.
- Re-evaluate the patient for PSV trial after possible CRRT re-initiation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral above-knee amputations. She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrates and effusion on chest X-ray. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and ineffective coping. The patient has multiple comorbidities including heart failure, tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, elevated INR, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, including infiltrates on chest X-ray and hypoxia. She is already receiving antibiotics but may require further treatment or a change in antibiotic regimen if the current therapy is not effective.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection. It is important to continue aggressive management, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be attempted once her condition stabilizes.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. This could be secondary to infection or a cardiac process. Digoxin has been"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease stage 5 on hemodialysis. The patient was found unresponsive at home and was intubated in the emergency department.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2 via endotracheal tube.

The patient is receiving several medications including argatroban, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient is also on renal replacement therapy with CVVH.

The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which has led to the use of argatroban as an anticoagulant. The patient also has a known allergy to heparin agents.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results indicate hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and anemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and previous bilateral below-knee amputations. She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. She is currently in septic shock, likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possible infectious etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, or gastrointestinal source. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but no culture data have been obtained. She also has pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, ineffective coping, pleural effusion, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She has a history of thrombocytopenia, HIT, and severe aortic stenosis with biventricular failure, with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient is being weaned off sedation and may attempt to change to pressure support ventilation (PSV). She will be monitored for signs of infection and her antibiotics will be broadened if necessary. She is also being evaluated for possible cardiac complications, such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and her digoxin levels will be monitored. Her INR is supratherapeutic, possibly due to the combination of warfarin and antibiotic therapy, and she will be started on argatroban,"

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was initially treated for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but has now developed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with a likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) component.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: She has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely due to prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator.
2. Respiratory failure: She is mechanically ventilated due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to HAP/VAP.
3. Pneumonia: She has developed HAP, initially treated as CAP, and now suspected VAP.
4. Ineffective coping: She is experiencing stress and anxiety related to her critical illness.
5. Pleural effusion: She has bilateral pleural effusions seen on chest imaging.
6. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: She presented with septic shock and is still hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
7. Renal failure: She has ESRD and is on maintenance hemodialysis.
8. Thrombocytopenia: She has a low platelet count due to HIT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on CXR. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, ineffective coping, pleural effusion, acute renal failure, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypoxia, hypotension, and fever suggests sepsis. The likely source of infection appears to be pulmonary, given the LLL infiltrate seen on CXR. Other possible infectious etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, and gastrointestinal source.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, as indicated by the LLL infiltrate on CXR and bilateral pleural effusion seen on lung cuts of CT abdomen. She has been treated with Levofloxacin and is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires supplemental oxygen to maintain sats >93%. She also has severe AS and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of ~20%.

4. Heart Failure/Functional AS: The patient's recent echo showed severe AS and biventricular failure. This could be secondary to infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, and CAD admitted with hypotension attributed to PNA/sepsis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for 4 days but has not shown improvement, with no fevers and no infectious organisms found in cultures. The patient's current conditions include shock (likely cardiogenic contribution), severe aortic stenosis, biventricular failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD, leukocytosis, and potential VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's initial shock was attributed to sepsis, but an echo showed severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure, suggesting a cardiogenic contribution to the shock. This makes weaning off pressors challenging.
2. Aortic Stenosis and Biventricular Failure: The patient's aortic stenosis is thought to be functional due to normal aortic valve last year. Fluid removal might benefit the patient, but afterload reduction is not an option since the patient is already hypotensive. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been resumed overnight.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient failed PSV (partial spontaneous ventilation) due to rapid shallow breathing and is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 93-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.
- She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for 4 days.
- The patient's condition has not improved, and there are no infectious organisms found in the cultures.
- She is experiencing shock, likely related to sepsis, but with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular failure contributing to difficulty weaning off pressors.
- The patient also has acute respiratory failure, failed pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to rapid shallow breathing, and has been given an empirical course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Her atrial fibrillation is now better controlled with digoxin.
- She has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and elevated INR, which is now subtherapeutic.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).
- Leukocytosis has dropped considerably after removing the femoral line yesterday and pancultured yesterday.
- The patient's overall condition remains critically ill.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of thrombocytopenia, bee pollen allergies, and unknown allergies. The patient is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, ineffective coping, hospital-acquired pneumonia, thrombocytopenia induced by heparin (HIT), acute pleural effusion, sepsis without organ dysfunction, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and impaired skin integrity.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set Vt of 400 mL, RR of 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 325. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 480, indicating severe hypoxemia.

2. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture results are pending, but he has been prescribed cefipime, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial respiratory infections.

3. Ineffective Coping: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below, indicating potential ineffective coping mechanisms or response to the ongoing medical conditions.

4. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is indicated by the presence of new or worsening respiratory symptoms after"

   hypotension attributed to PNA/sepsis. She has been treated with broad
   spectrum abx and pressors for 4 days with no fevers, and no recovery of
   infectious organisms from micro cultures.
   1. Shock: initially felt to be related to sepsis but w/ echo showing
   severe AS and BiV failure making cardiogenic contribution likely.
   Contributing to difficulty weaning pressors.
   -goal MAP 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated
   -ID mgmt as below
   -CV mgmt as below
   2. Ao stenosis, BiV failure: thought to be functional AS given normal
   aortic valve last year; might benefit from some fluid removal. Already
   hypotensive so afterload reduction not an option
   -CVVH resumed overnight
   3. Acute respiratory failure: failed PSV due to rapid shallow
   breathing, empiric course for VAP
   -re-eval for PSV trial now that CVVH restarted
   -day 7 of vanco + cefepime, total 8d planned
   4. Atrial fibrillation- much better controlled now with dig
   5. HIT/ Elevated INR- now subtherapeutic INR
   -in the context of HIT would start argatroban gtt
   -holding coumadin for now
   6. ESRD: Renal team following
   -would ask Renal team to re-eval for CVVH, without citrate as this led
   to lyte imbalances before

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but there have been no fevers, and no infectious organisms have been recovered from the cultures.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with shock, which was initially thought to be related to sepsis. However, an echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular (BiV) failure, suggesting a cardiogenic contribution to the shock. This has made weaning off the pressors difficult.
   - Goal is to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60, and to wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Infection management and cardiovascular management will continue as previously planned.
2. Aortic stenosis, BiV failure: The patient's AS is thought to be functional due to normal aortic valve function last year. It might benefit from fluid removal. However, the patient is already hypotensive, so afterload reduction is not an option.
   - Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) will be resumed overnight.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient failed non-invasive ventilation (PSV)"

   [**Age over 90 323**] yo female with ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, CAD admitted with
   hypotension attributed to PNA/sepsis. She has been treated with broad
   spectrum abx and pressors for 4 days with no fevers, and no recovery of
   infectious organisms from micro cultures.
   1. Shock: initially felt to be related to sepsis but w/ echo showing
   severe AS and BiV failure making cardiogenic contribution likely.
   Contributing to difficulty weaning pressors.
   -goal MAP 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated
   -ID mgmt as below
   -CV mgmt as below
   2. Ao stenosis, BiV failure: thought to be functional AS given normal
   aortic valve last year; might benefit from some fluid removal. 2L
   negative overnight via CVVH, but continues to be on levophed. Was dig
   loaded for atrial kick.
   -CVVH resumed overnight
   -check dig level tomorrow morning
   3. Acute respiratory failure: will attempt to wean to PS 15/5 today;
   bolus sedation only
 wean to extubate
   -re-eval for PSV trial now that CVVH restarted
   -day 8 of vanco + cefepime, total 8d planned
 d/c today
   4. Atrial fibrillation- much better controlled now with dig
   5. HIT/ Elevated INR- now subtherapeutic INR
   -in the context of HIT on argatroban gtt
   -holding coumadin for now
   6. ESRD: Renal team following
   -on CVVH now
   7. Leukocytosis: dropped considerably after fem line pulled yesterday
   and pancultured yesterday, otherwise vigilant monitoring for infxn

","The patient is a 93-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but there have been no fevers or recovery of infectious organisms from microcultures.

The patient's current condition includes shock, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and biventricular failure (BiV failure). The contributing factors to her difficulty weaning off the pressors are the shock and BiV failure. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 55-60 mmHg and wean levophed as tolerated. The patient is also being managed for atrial fibrillation, HIT/elevated INR, ESRD, and leukocytosis.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ongoing shock and cardiovascular instability due to severe AS and BiV failure. The use of pressors and CVVH indicates ongoing hemodynamic support required. There is also a risk for infection due to prolonged ICU stay and indwelling lines. Close monitoring for any signs of infection is crucial. Additionally, the patient's kidney function needs to be closely monitored given her ESRD and CVVH treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted with hypotension attributed to pneumonia/sepsis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors for four days, but has not shown improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, initially believed to be related to sepsis but now thought to be cardiogenic due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular (BiV) failure. This makes weaning off pressors difficult.
2. Aortic stenosis, BiV failure: The patient's aortic stenosis may be functional and could benefit from fluid removal. She continues to be on levophed and has had some fluid removed via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and will attempt to be weaned off the ventilator today. She will be given bolus sedation only and may be extubated soon.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is now better controlled with digoxin.
5. HIT/elevated INR: The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and an elevated INR. She is currently on argatro"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to a pulmonary source, as well as pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen. She is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for multiple sites of infection. She has a history of NSTEMI and severe aortic stenosis with biventricular failure, with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. Cardiac function may be depressed due to infection or a cardiac process. The patient is alternating between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. She has been started on digoxin for improved atrial kick and contractility.

The patient has a history of HIT, complicated by thrombus in both lower extremities requiring amputations. She is anticoagulated with argatroban and is not receiving heparin products. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, and she is undergoing CVVH with good fluid removal.

The patient also has anemia, likely due to chronic disease and blood loss from blood draws and procedures. She is being monitored for infection and has active stool guaiac positive. Her thyroid function is being managed with levothyrox"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with
   hypoxia, hypotension and infiltrate and effusion on CXR.
   .
   # Septic shock: Patient presented tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive
   requiring levaphed in ED. Likely pulm source given LLL infiltrate
   although largely unchanged from 4 days prior. Other possible infectious
   etiologies include meningitis, urosepsis, GI source.  Now afebrile, but
   still hypotensive on levophed. Likely secondary to VAP.
   - PICC
   - Will attempt to wean off levophed yesterday, failed, accepting MaP
   55, SBP ~80s.
   - challenged with fluid boluses recently  with no effect on clinical
   status/pressor requirement.
   - continue Vanc/cefepime, day 7 of 8
   - blood, urine, sputum cx; no growth to date, viral swab for flus
   negative
   - stool for C diff negative negative.
   -attempt to wean sedation and change to PSV
   -[**Last Name (un) 45**] stim appropriate.

   # respiratory failure-Pneumonia: LLL infiltrate seen on CXR and
   bilateral plerual effusion seen on lung cuts of CT abd.  Was on
   treatment with Levofloxacin since [**7-23**].
   - continue vanc/cefepime as above day [**7-17**]
   - no culture data to date
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   - O2 to maintain sats > 93%
   - DFA for flu negative
   .
   #leukocytosis-Pt at risk for multiple areas sites of infection. Sent
   urine via straight cath for cx. Line sites c/d/i. Sent stool for
   c.diff. Check vanco level as dosing by level. Continue to monitor and
   will reculture and/or broaded abx for signs of infection.
   -femoral line removed yesterday.
   .
   #heart failure/functional AS-as evidenced on recent echo. Severe AS
   and  biventricular failure. EF ~20%. Could be secondary to infection
   vs. cardiac process. However, renal and pt
s son report that this echo
   findings are not new and were seen a few months ago at [**Hospital1 **].
   -cardiology consult-suggested digoxin for improved atrial kick and
   contractility, started yesterday with improvement in HR to 80s.
   -
   . # Tachycardia/afib
 patient atlernating between sinus tach around
   100 and afib with rates around 110 to 120s.  Rate is somewhat
   repsonsive to fluids.  Patient has been on metoprolol at home, but
   being held in setting of hypotension.  Although can continue fluids as
   needed, can possibly consider tighter rate control with hopes that BP
   improves.
   - echo as above.
   -anticoag with argatroban
   -started on dig with check level mon am.
   .
   # HIT: Diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l lower
   extrem requiring amputations. PTT initially very elevated but nl on
   repeat; may have been spurious value.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting.
   - trend coags
   -on argatroban
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Currently lytes WNL and does not appear to have increased
   pulm edema, stable on trach settings.
   - f/u renal recs, has started on CVVH, stopped a few days ago secondary
   to suspected citrate toxicity- Ca increasing and ionized Ca decreasing,
   with hypomag and hypophosphetemia
   - renal following along, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**]
   - continue to monitor electrolytes.
   -undergoing CVVH
   .
   #anemia-pt with slight HCT drop this am. Likely secondary to blood loss
   during yesterday
s procedure/line placement.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   -guaiac stools.
   .
   # L Hand swelling: noticed overnight with very white fingers on L hand,
   now more normal, R hand still more swollen
   - RUE US to rule out clot around HD cath, no clot.
   .
   # CAD: Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
   - continue ASA
   -will likely need optimization.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 93-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with hypoxia, hypotension, and infiltrate and effusion on chest X-ray. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, such as leukocytosis and fever, which may lead to sepsis. She is already on antibiotics (Vanc/cefepime) for suspected pneumonia, but there is no growth in the cultures so far.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen and chest X-ray. This can lead to respiratory failure if not adequately treated.

3. Heart failure/functional AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis (AS) and biventricular failure with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. This may be secondary to infection or cardiac process.

4. Tachycardia/atrial fibrillation: The patient is alternating between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rates around 110 to 120 beats per minute. Rate control may be necessary, especially if her blood pressure improves.

5. HIT: The patient has a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia), ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease) on HD (Hemodialysis), and previous bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, as evidenced by a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and bilateral pleural effusion seen on CT abdomen. 

The patient also has shock, likely due to a pulmonary source, although other infectious etiologies such as meningitis, urosepsis, or gastrointestinal source cannot be ruled out. She is currently hypotensive and requires levophed support. There is evidence of severely depressed cardiac function, which may contribute to the shock state.

Other significant findings include leukocytosis, possibly due to multiple sites of infection, and the patient is at risk for further infections. She has a history of chronic heart failure with severe aortic stenosis and biventricular failure, with an ejection fraction of around 20%. 

The patient is also experiencing tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, alternating between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Her renal function is being managed with CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis) after stopping earlier due to concern for citrate toxicity. 

She has a history of HIT, diagnosed in December 2"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs.  Will try to diurese her and hope for improvement
   of SBTs.  DFA for flu negative.
   - PST today
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.
   - rate control with dig for improvement of functional AS
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection, line has been removed
   - continue levophed with hopes to wean it down
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (until [**8-10**]);
   switch to ampicillin if not VRE
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH getting 100 cc/hour removed.
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia and shock, likely due to septic shock caused by pneumonia.

The patient has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has a likely line infection, although the femoral line has been removed. The patient's mental status has not been a barrier to extubation. She has rapid shallow breathing with spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). The plan is to diurese her and hope for improvement of SBTs.

The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) for volume removal, levophed for vasopressor support, and digoxin for rate control. She has severe aortic stenosis (AS) but with functional AS due to low ejection fraction (EF) and poor filling times. There was initial improvement of heart rate (HR) with digoxin, but she is now more tachycardic in the setting of volume removal. Cardioversion may be considered if unable to wean from pressors.

The patient has a history of HIT diagnosed in December 2021 and complicated by thrombus in both lower"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who was admitted with sepsis and pneumonia. She developed acute respiratory failure and shock secondary to sepsis and cardiogenic causes. The patient remains tachypneic and is dependent on pressors for blood pressure support. She has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently on argatroban. Her white blood cell count is rising but improving with fluid removal via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and drop in tidal volumes suggest an increased work of breathing. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if ventilation support is not optimized.
2. Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. Etiologies include sepsis (resolving), cardiogenic (reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), and sedation. Adjustments in pressors may be necessary to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55.
3. Rising WBC: Although the WBC count is improving with fluid removal, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state. Antibiotic coverage should be continued and monitored.
4. HIT: The patient has a history of HIT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted with sepsis/pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory failure and shock secondary to sepsis/cardiogenic causes. The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient remains tachypneic with attempts to wean, even on high positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) settings. This could be due to agitation or increased work of breathing (WOB). The patient has been undergoing fluid removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and is back on assist-control (AC) ventilation. It is planned to try pressure support ventilation (PSV) again this afternoon.

2. Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension. Etiologies of shock include sepsis (resolving), cardiogenic causes, and sedation. Digoxin has been loaded to decrease heart rate, and levels are adequate. Pressors will continue to be adjusted to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.

3. Rising White Blood Cell Count: The patient's WBC count is improving with removal of the femoral triple-lumen catheter. Extended antibiotic therapy (change to linezolid) will be given for 7 days post-line removal, and follow-up sensit"

   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis), and previous bilateral above-knee amputations. The patient presents with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient also has shock, which initially appeared to be septic shock due to pneumonia. However, there is an element of cardiogenic shock given her functional aortic stenosis (AS) in the setting of tachycardia. The patient had a positive cortisol response with a [Last Name (un)]-stim test.

Additionally, the patient has an enterococcus line infection from the femoral line, which has been removed. The patient is currently on linezolid for a 7-day course post-removal of the line.

The patient also has heart failure/functional AS, with severe AS but likely functional due to low ejection fraction (EF) and poor filling times. Rate control with digoxin is being attempted for improvement of functional AS.

Furthermore, the patient has HIT, which was diagnosed in [12/2141] and complicated by thrombus in both lower extremities requiring amputations. The patient is currently on argatroban, but warfarin has not been restarted.

   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (until [**8-10**]);
   switch to ampicillin if not VRE
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities
   - trend WBC and fever curve

   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 2807], a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis), and previous bilateral above-knee amputations, presents with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia. She is currently sedated and intubated in the ICU.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) but has not shown improvement. She also has an acute pleural effusion and signs of sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's mental status has not been a barrier to extubation. She has rapid shallow breathing with spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). The healthcare team plans to diurese her and hope for improvement in SBTs. A DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) for flu is negative.

The patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due to pneumonia. She is also likely experiencing a line infection, although the femoral line has been removed. The patient had a 20-point cortisol response with a [Last Name (un)]-stim test, suggesting some element of cardiogenic shock given her functional AS (aortic stenosis) in the setting of tachycardia. 

The patient has severe AS, but it is likely functional due to low EF (ejection fraction), poor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 2807], a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and s/p b/l AKA, presents with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and immobility.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia. She has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but her mental status has not improved, indicating ineffective treatment.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient presented with septic shock, which was initially thought to be secondary to pneumonia. However, she also likely has a line infection in the femoral line, which has been removed. She is now being treated with linezolid for Enterococcus line infection.
4. Enterococcus line infection: The tip of the femoral line was positive for Enterococcus, leading to the removal of the line. The patient will receive linezolid for a 7-day course post-removal of the line until August 10th. If not VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), she will be switched to ampicillin.
5. G-tube bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding upon residual checks of the G-tube"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs.  Will try to diurese her and hope for improvement
   of SBTs.  DFA for flu negative.
   - PST today
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.
   - rate control with dig for improvement of functional AS
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection, line has been removed
   - continue levophed with hopes to wean it down
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (until [**8-10**]);
   switch to ampicillin if not VRE
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and previous bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia, shock, an enterococcus line infection, heart failure with functional aortic stenosis (AS), and a history of HIT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased skin perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she develops further pneumonia or experiences ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress if the source of infection is not effectively controlled, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate if CVVH is not adequately managing her fluid balance and electrolytes.
5. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock if there is an underlying myocardial infarction or further deterioration in her functional AS.
6. Enterococcus Line Infection: The patient may develop systemic enterococcal infection if the line infection is not promptly treated.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and previous bilateral above-knee amputations (AKAs). She was admitted with pneumonia (PNA) and septic shock, resulting in acute respiratory failure. The patient's major issues include acute respiratory failure, shock, VRE line sepsis, HIT, ESRD, and possible upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to recent pneumonia, fluid overload, and sedation. Ventilation weaning should be done cautiously, minimizing sedative medications.
2. Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent and is at risk of further complications from septic and cardiogenic shock. Pressors should be adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >55.
3. VRE Line Sepsis: The patient has been treated with linezolid for suspected vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) line sepsis. However, blood cultures remain negative. Monitoring for any signs of infection or sepsis is crucial.
4. HIT: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to argatroban therapy for HIT. Increased IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dosing and serial hematocrit (Hct) checks"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 93-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who was admitted with sepsis and pneumonia. She has since developed acute respiratory failure and shock secondary to sepsis and cardiogenic causes.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fluid overload. Daily pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials are being attempted to decrease support. Antibiotics have been finished for healthcare-associated community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) coverage, and fluid removal is being performed using continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
2. Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing need for vasopressors. The etiologies of shock include resolving sepsis and cardiogenic factors. Digoxin has been loaded to decrease heart rate, and pressors are being adjusted to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.
3. Leukocytosis: There is no clear source of infection, so treatment for femoral line-associated bloodstream infection (FBAB) with linezolid for a total of 7 days (d2 today) is ongoing.
4. HIT: The patient is on argatroban gtt for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
5. ESRD: Fluid removal is being"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 2807] is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and previous bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, shock, enterococcus line infection, and functional aortic stenosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia. If not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, likely secondary to septic shock due to pneumonia. If not treated promptly, this can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Enterococcus Line Infection: The patient has an enterococcus line infection, which can potentially spread to other parts of the body if not treated effectively. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
4. Functional Aortic Stenosis: The patient has functional aortic stenosis, which may worsen with volume removal and could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. G-Tube Bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding upon residual check through her G-tube. This could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be evaluated and managed promptly to prevent further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient is anemic, likely due to chronic disease and blood loss. If not corrected, anemia can lead to fatigue"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs.  Will try to diurese her and hope for improvement
   of SBTs.  DFA for flu negative.
   - PST today
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.
   - rate control with dig for improvement of functional AS
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection, line has been removed
   - continue levophed with hopes to wean it down, vasopressin for map
   goal >55
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (until [**8-10**]);
   switch to ampicillin if not VRE
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities
   - trend WBC and fever curvej
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -PM HCT
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stool
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH getting 100 cc/hour removed.
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","The patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Arterial line dysfunction: The patient's arterial line stopped working, which can lead to difficulties in accurately monitoring blood pressure and obtaining arterial blood samples for laboratory testing.

2. Difficulty in obtaining arterial access: The attending physician and anesthesia team attempted to establish arterial access but were unsuccessful. This suggests a possible issue with peripheral arterial catheterization or a blocked artery.

3. Hypotension during CVVH: The patient experienced hypotension during continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), requiring the administration of approximately 1 liter of fluid and an increase in the dosage of levophed, a vasopressor medication.

4. Pink/bloody secretions with Tfeeds: The patient's tracheal feeds resulted in pink/bloody secretions, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding or aspiration.

5. Linezolid for Enterococcus line infection: The tip of the femoral line tested positive for Enterococcus, suggesting a line-associated infection. Linezolid, an antibiotic effective against Enterococcus, has been prescribed for a seven-day course following the removal of the line.

6. G-tube bleeding: The patient experienced bleeding upon residual check from the gastrostomy tube, which requires further evaluation and management.

7. Heart failure/functional AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis (AS) but is likely experiencing functional AS due to low left ventricular e"

   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - attempt to look for arterial access in L groin today, although was
   site of infection and very high risk
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection, line has been removed
   - cont levofed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]).
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities - VRE

   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 2807] is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA, presenting with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She also has severe heart failure physiology and has been unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has developed a line infection. She is currently on CVVH for volume removal and will continue pressors at current levels. An arterial line has been unsuccessful due to dampened function, and alternative methods to obtain accurate blood pressure readings are being explored. The patient's mental status has not improved, and plans for long-term decision-making will be discussed in a family meeting tomorrow. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has developed a line infection, specifically Enterococcus, which has been treated with linezolid. The line has been removed, but the patient will continue to be monitored for any signs of infection or sepsis.
2. Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock due to pneumonia but now has elements of cardiogenic shock due to functional AS (aortic stenosis). She is failing to wean off the pressors, and efforts to establish arterial access have been unsuccessful.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and s/p b/l AKA presenting with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia. She also has severe heart failure physiology, unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not appropriately managed.

2. Line infection: The patient had a femoral line infection caused by Enterococcus, which has been removed but requires further treatment with linezolid.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has an element of cardiogenic shock due to her functional AS (aortic stenosis) in the setting of tachycardia. Rate control with digoxin is recommended for improvement of functional AS.

4. G-tube bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding upon residual check, which needs to be evaluated and managed accordingly.

5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia likely secondary to chronic disease and blood loss from blood draws and procedures. Monitoring HCT (hematocrit) levels and considering transfusions if necessary is important.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and IV levothyroxine should be continued.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia and
   complicated by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off
   vent or pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs with Vt less than 100 on PS 5/5.  Not improving
   despite removing fluid through CVVH.  DFA for flu negative.
   - cont PS trials
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   - patient not making much progress and will discuss long term decision
   making with family in meeting today at 230om
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection until [**8-12**]^rd , line
   has been removed
   - cont levophed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   VRE line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.  Line
   has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]) until
   [**8-12**]
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities - VRE
   - trend WBC and fever curve, has been afebrile
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct trending down slightly, not quickly
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stool
   - tx for hct <21
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
   .
   Goals of care.  Patient
s family is hoping to take patient home, though
   realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of
   vent support.  Per family, patient would not want trach.

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and bilateral below-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is receiving multiple vasopressors for hemodynamic support.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia, but her mental status has not improved enough to allow extubation. There are concerns about potential complications such as shock, line infections, and anemia. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, functional aortic stenosis, and previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%. Additionally, she has hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 70/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,151 mL and output of 4,348 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,197 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia and
   complicated by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off
   vent or pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs with Vt less than 100 on PS 5/5.  Not improving
   despite removing fluid through CVVH.  DFA for flu negative.
   - cont PS trials
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   - patient not making much progress and will discuss long term decision
   making with family in meeting today at 230om
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection until [**8-12**]^rd , line
   has been removed
   - cont levophed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   VRE line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.  Line
   has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]) until
   [**8-12**]
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities - VRE
   - trend WBC and fever curve, has been afebrile
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct trending down slightly, not quickly
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stool
   - tx for hct <21
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
   .
   Goals of care.  Patient
s family is hoping to take patient home, though
   realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of
   vent support.  Per family, patient would not want trach.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Last Name 2807], a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and bilateral above-knee amputations, is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status has not improved despite removing fluid through CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and the need for continued mechanical ventilation.

2. Shock: The patient presented with septic shock due to pneumonia but now has an element of cardiogenic shock given her functional AS in the setting of tachycardia. This can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

3. VRE Line Infection: The tip of the femoral line was positive for Enterococcus, indicating a potential line infection. This can lead to bloodstream infection and sepsis.

4. G-tube Bleeding: The patient experienced bleeding from the G-tube, which may require intervention to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.

5. Heart Failure: The patient has severe AS, but it is likely functional due to low EF and poor filling times. There is an improvement in HR with digoxin, but the patient remains tachycardic during volume removal.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 2807], a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and previous bilateral above-knee amputations, presents with respiratory failure secondary to presumed pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. She is unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors. The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and also has a likely line infection. Her mental status has not been a barrier to extubation. She has rapid shallow breathing with spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with a tidal volume (Vt) less than 100 on pressure support (PS) 5/5. Not improving despite removing fluid through continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). Direct fluorescent assay (DFA) for flu negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Continue pressure support trials, chest physiotherapy/suctioning as needed, and discuss long-term decision-making with the family in a meeting today at 2:30 pm.
2. Shock: Continue current level of pressors, titrate to mental status for now as cannot assess blood pressure accurately, urine output, or heart rate (as patient has stable tachycardia and atrial fibrillation).
3. Enterococcus line infection: Administer linezolid for 7-day course post-removal of line (day 1 [8-5]) until [8-12]. Follow up Enterococcus sensitivities - Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE).
4. G-tube bleeding: Follow up Hct trending down slightly, not quickly. Order guaiac stool test and treat for Hct <21.
5. Heart failure/functional aortic stenosis (AS): Continue digoxin for rate control. Consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors.
6. Prothrombin-induced by unfractionated heparin (PIFH): Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider resuming post-extubation. Continue argatroban, which has been therapeutic.
7. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD): Continue CVVH with goal net negative fluid balance. Follow TID electrolytes and renal recommendations.
8. Anemia: Trend Hct. Active T+S.
9. Coronary artery disease (CAD): No aspirin, beta-blocker given pressor requirement. Continue statin.
10. Hypothyroidism: Continue IV levothyroxine.
11. Goals of care: Family hopes to take patient home, though realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of ventilator support. Per family, patient would not want tracheostomy. Schedule family meeting today, followed by palliative care and social work consultation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia and
   complicated by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off
   vent or pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs with Vt less than 100 on PS 5/5.  Not improving
   despite removing fluid through CVVH.  DFA for flu negative.
   - cont PS trials
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   - patient not making much progress and will discuss long term decision
   making with family in meeting today at 230om
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection until [**8-12**]^rd , line
   has been removed
   - cont levophed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   VRE line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.  Line
   has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]) until
   [**8-12**]
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities - VRE
   - trend WBC and fever curve, has been afebrile
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct trending down slightly, not quickly
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stool
   - tx for hct <21
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
   .
   Goals of care.  Patient
s family is hoping to take patient home, though
   realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of
   vent support.  Per family, patient would not want trach.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT, ESRD on HD, and s/p bilateral amputations. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. The patient has been unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if she does not improve despite removing fluid through CVVH. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation may be considered to support her breathing.

2. Shock: The patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due to pneumonia and also has likely line infection. She has an element of cardiogenic shock given her dysfunctional AS in the setting of tachycardia. The patient's failure to wean off the pressors suggests ongoing hemodynamic instability.

3. VRE Line Infection: The tip of the femoral line was positive for Enterococcus, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics. Linezolid has been started for a 7-day course post-removal of the line until August 12th.

4. G-tube Bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding upon residual check with a pink-colored blood. Her Hct is trending down slightly, not quickly. A gastrointestinal bleed should be considered, and further investigations such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia and
   complicated by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off
   vent or pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Has failed
   PS trials for last week.  Plan for extubation today after family
   members all in town.
   - plan for terminal extubation after family prepared
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection until [**8-12**]^rd , line
   has been removed
   - cont levophed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH stopped last night
   .
   Tachycardia.  Likely secondary to heart failure, volume depeletion,
   atrial  fib.  Unknown etiology, but no escalation of care.
   - cont telemetry
   - pain control trial to see if HR improves, want pt to be comfortable
   .
   VRE line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.  Line
   has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]) until
   [**8-12**]
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct stable, no escalation of care
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butn [**Last Name (un) **] more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH stopped last night
   - no escalation of care, appreciate renal recs throughout her
   hospitalization
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -no tx as no escalation of care
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
   .
   Goals of care.  Patient
s family is hoping to take patient home, though
   realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of
   vent support.  Per family, patient would not want trach.
   - family meeting went well, plan for no escalation of care and terminal
   extubation this afternoon after family arrives
   - will make comfortable with morphine drip prior to extubation
   - palliative care & social work following

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral above-knee amputations (AKAs). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. She has failed pulmonary toilet trials for the past week and is unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors.

The patient's condition is further complicated by shock, likely due to septic shock from pneumonia and a line infection. She also has tachycardia, possibly secondary to heart failure, volume depletion, and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. She also has hypothyroidism.

The patient's family has made the decision to withdraw care, and the plan is to extubate the patient at the family's request. The goals of care are to make the patient comfortable and provide palliative care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of heart failure, development of additional infections, and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting held with ICU team, palliative care, social work, and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**].  Family made patient DNR.  They are awaiting the arrival of
   the patient's brother (?tomorrow) and they will withdraw care when the
   family is all here.  We will stop CVVH when the filter clots (tonight)
   and will not escalate the current level of care.  Family was very
   thankful for all of the care they have received.
   - CVVH filter ran out, so this was stopped
   - tube feeds stop at palliative care's reccomendation
   - HR increasing to the 140s

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and bilateral above-knee amputations (AKAs). She presents with respiratory failure secondary to suspected pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. The patient has not been able to wean off the ventilator or pressors.

The patient also has shock, with an initial presentation of septic shock due to pneumonia. However, it is now believed that she has an element of cardiogenic shock due to functional aortic stenosis (AS). The patient failed a corticotropin stimulation test, indicating adrenal insufficiency.

Additionally, the patient has a VRE line infection, for which linezolid has been prescribed. There is also evidence of leukocytosis, but it is trending down.

Furthermore, the patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by guaiac-positive stools and a decreasing hemoglobin level. A gastrointestinal tube (G-tube) bleeding was noted, which is being managed with proton pump inhibitors and further investigations.

The patient has severe AS, as shown by the most recent echocardiogram. However, the AS is likely functional due to poor filling times and a low ejection fraction (EF). Rate control with digoxin has been initiated.

The patient has been diagnosed with HIT, which was complicated by thrombosis in both lower extrem"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting held with ICU team, palliative care, social work, and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**].  Family made patient DNR.  They are awaiting the arrival of
   the patient's brother (?tomorrow) and they will withdraw care when the
   family is all here.  We will stop CVVH when the filter clots (tonight)
   and will not escalate the current level of care.  Family was very
   thankful for all of the care they have received.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a [**Age over 90 323**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia and
   complicated by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off
   vent or pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Has failed
   PS trials for last week.  Plan for extubation today after family
   members all in town.
   - plan for terminal extubation after family prepared
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 60**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection until [**8-12**]^rd , line
   has been removed
   - cont levophed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH stopped last night
   .
   Tachycardia.  Likely secondary to heart failure, volume depeletion,
   atrial  fib.  Unknown etiology, but no escalation of care.
   - cont telemetry
   - pain control trial to see if HR improves, want pt to be comfortable
   .
   VRE line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.  Line
   has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**8-5**]) until
   [**8-12**]
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct stable, no escalation of care
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butn [**Last Name (un) **] more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH stopped last night
   - no escalation of care, appreciate renal recs throughout her
   hospitalization
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guiaic positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -no tx as no escalation of care
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
   .
   Goals of care.  Patient
s family is hoping to take patient home, though
   realistically not possible given CVVH, two pressors, and high degree of
   vent support.  Per family, patient would not want trach.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis), and s/p bilateral above-knee amputations. She presents with respiratory failure secondary to presumed pneumonia and complicated by severe heart failure physiology. The patient is unable to wean off the ventilator or pressors.

The family has agreed to switch the goals of care to comfort measures only (CMO) and has requested terminal extubation. The patient's condition has worsened overnight with tachycardia and an inability to obtain a reasonable oxygen saturation. A mild response was observed to a bolus of fentanyl and midazolam.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include potential respiratory complications due to pneumonia and the inability to wean off the ventilator, cardiac complications due to severe heart failure physiology, and potential bleeding complications due to her history of HIT. Additionally, the patient's age and comorbidities increase her risk for further complications."
