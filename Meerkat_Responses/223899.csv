- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of systolic and diastolic CHF, hypertension, and a left femoral shaft fracture.
- She was intubated in the ED for flash pulmonary edema and is currently in the ICU.
- The patient has been aggressive diuresed overnight, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1.47L.
- Serial hematocrit levels have remained stable.
- The patient's surgical team consented to surgery, so she was not extubated only to be reintubated again.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and depression.
- She also has leukocytosis with a history of a urinary tract infection caused by pan-sensitive E. coli.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/40 mmHg to 167/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- Physical examination findings include crackles at the bases of the lungs, symmetric chest expansion, and absent peripheral pulses in both legs.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

   83 year-old female with history of systolic and diastolic CHF with EF
   50%, hypertension presenting status post a mechanical fall at home with
   left femoral shaft fracture and intubated in the ED for presumptive
   flash pulmonary edema.
   # Respiratory failure: In the ED, the patient developed hypertension to
   the 220s/100s and rales, became hypoxemic, and was subsequently
   intubated despite preexisiting wish for DNR/DNI.  Based on this history
   and her chest imaging, it appears as if the patient developed flash
   pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive crisis.  She had lateral
   ST depressions on EKG and we will repeat EKG and send cardiac enzymes
   to evaluate for ischemia.  She does not appear to have an underlying
   pulmonary process such as pneumonia or underlying chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease.
   - Need to discuss goals of care with family

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. She presents with respiratory failure and a left femoral shaft fracture after a mechanical fall at home. She was intubated in the emergency department (ED) for presumptive flash pulmonary edema, which developed during a hypertensive crisis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/40 mmHg to 167/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 18.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, left femoral shaft fracture, leukocytosis (urinary tract infection), chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypertension, anemia, chronic renal failure, and depression. 

The plan includes discussing goals of care with the family, extubation if no wish for operative repair of the fracture"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with history of systolic and diastolic CHF with EF
   50%, hypertension presenting status post a mechanical fall at home with
   left femoral shaft fracture and intubated in the ED for presumptive
   flash pulmonary edema.
   # Respiratory failure: In the ED, the patient developed hypertension to
   the 220s/100s and rales, became hypoxemic, and was subsequently
   intubated despite preexisiting wish for DNR/DNI.  Based on this history
   and her chest imaging, it appears as if the patient developed flash
   pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive crisis.  She had lateral
   ST depressions on EKG and we will repeat EKG and send cardiac enzymes
   to evaluate for ischemia.  She does not appear to have an underlying
   pulmonary process such as pneumonia or underlying chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease.
   - Need to discuss goals of care with family
 if no wish for OR for
   fracture repair, will diurese and extubate
   - Lasix 30 mg IV x 1, goal -1L
   - Continue home regimen of aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril
   - Discontinue nitroglycerin gtt
   - Repeat EKG, monitor cardiac enzymes
   - Pain control with fentanyl gtt
   # Left femoral shaft fracture: Reduced/splinted in the ED.
   - Need to discuss goals of care with family and whether the patient and
   family desire fracture repair in the OR
   - Followed by Orthopedics
   - Fentanyl for pain
   - Continue calcium and vitamin D
   # Status post fall: Mechanical in nature per original description per
   patient, but will need to confirm once extubated.  Head CT without
   acute process.
   - Left femoral shaft fracture as above
   - Followed by Trauma Surgery with clearing of C-spine film
   - Clinically clear C-spine when extubated
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has a urinary tract infection - history of
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  No other localizing signs or symptoms.  Chest
   x-ray without consolidation.
   - Ciprofloxacin 250 mg IV Q12 x 3 days
   - Will add-on urine culture to admission urinalysis if possible and
   obtain blood cultures
   # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: EF 50%.
   - Treatment as above with metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix
   # Hypertension: Became hypertensive in the ED, likely due to pain, and
   developed flash pulmonary edema.
   - Treatment as above with metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix
   - Fentanyl for pain
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-to-low 30s, currently 37.
   - Monitor
   # Chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9; at baseline.  GFR 46.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Depression: No acute issues.
   - Continue fluoxetine

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. She presented to the emergency department after a mechanical fall at home, resulting in a left femoral shaft fracture. The patient was intubated in the ED for presumptive flash pulmonary edema.

2. The patient has respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the development of hypertension and rales in the ED. There are no signs of an underlying pulmonary process such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

3. The patient's left femoral shaft fracture was reduced and splinted in the ED. The plan is to discuss the goals of care with the family regarding fracture repair, as the patient may not wish to proceed with surgery.

4. The patient also has leukocytosis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive E. coli. Antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin has been initiated.

5. The patient has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%. Treatment includes medications such as metoprolol, lisinopril, and lasix.

6. The patient's hypertension became uncontrolled in the ED, leading to flash pulmonary edema. The same"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension and systolic and diastolic heart failure. She sustained a mechanical fall resulting in a femoral shaft fracture and was intubated in the emergency department due to flash pulmonary edema. She remains intubated in anticipation of surgery for femoral repair. The patient has been aggressively diuresed and effectively afterload reduced. She will be taken to the operating room today for femoral repair. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support level of 5 cmH2O, showing adequate gas exchange. The plan is to reassess her post-operation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is closely monitored due to previous flash pulmonary edema and ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if there are complications during surgery or if the patient does not wean off the ventilator successfully after the procedure.
2. Infection: Prolonged intubation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls are being implemented to reduce this risk.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgery increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures include the use of compression boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.
4. Hypotension: Given the patient's history of syst"
