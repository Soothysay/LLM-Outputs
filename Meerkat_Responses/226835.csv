   Microbiology: [**2135-9-24**]: Sputum growing strep pneumonia (moderate) and
   Klebsiella (sparse)
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVD on
   coumadin, amiodarone, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted s/p fall
   with SDH and s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with
   hernation, course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now
   with strep pneumonia
    Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated
   [**9-20**]. ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of
   breathing and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and
   pneumonia. Etiology of resp failure is infections and cardiogenic.
   - currently on AC 50%/ 600/ 14/ 5
   - no currently on sedation, nor responsive to command
   - check CK, triglycerides, LFTs on propofol
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patient with purulent sputum, culture grew 4+ Strep
   pneumo and sparse klebsiella. spiked fever of 100.7 today. Fever likely
   secondary to PNA, which is not covered by vanco.
   - discontinue Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**])
   - start Ceftriaxone 1gm daily
   - send blood cultures and resend sputum culture
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. had unequal pupils [**2-24**] and had stat Head CT showing no
   inrval change
   - continue dilantin ppx
   - will need repeat head CT 2 weeks after [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - make sure neurosurg continues to follow, will ask them about
   restarting coumadin despite high INR
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O negative. looks euvolemic today, will hold diuresis unless
   is positive
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve. needs to be
   anticoagulated. Warfarin has been held since admission. Pt recieved 3
   units [**Hospital3 **] on admission. on [**9-25**] patient had INR 3.8 adn revieved a
   total of 4 units [**Month/Year (2) **]. and INR now down to 2.8. etiology of new
   coagulopathy unclear, but may be that intial [**Name (NI) **] wore off. is also
   likely vitamin K deficient.
   - will continue to monitor INR for now
   - Plan with neuro and cardiology was to start warfarin without bolus
   today. will hold off today in setting of INR 2.8. Will talk to
   cardiology and neuro today about restarting.
   - Hold warfarin 1mg daily for now
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 2.2
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: not will controlled, BP ranges from 110-150 systolic.
   - Hydralazine 25mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 10 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism
   - Switch IV levothyroxine to home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: continue statin
   Hypernatremia: has been trending up, likely contributing to mental
   status
   - increase free water boluses from 200q6 to 300q4.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve disease, who was admitted after a fall resulting in a left subdural hematoma. He underwent an emergency left craniotomy for evacuation of the hematoma. The patient's INR was 4.2, and he received multiple units of blood product transfusion. Initially, he was extubated but experienced a desaturation episode and was reintubated due to respiratory distress caused by pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He has been on mechanical ventilation since then.

The patient has several comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and gout. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/67 to 93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal stable post-surgical changes following the left frontal craniotomy, along with a left parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage and right frontal subdural hematoma. The patient's sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumonia"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin. He was admitted after falling and experiencing a left subdural hematoma, which required an emergency left craniotomy for evacuation. The patient's course has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, pneumonia, and anemia.

The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure but was later extubated. However, he required reintubation due to increased work of breathing and airway protection in the setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The etiology of respiratory failure is attributed to infection and cardiogenic causes.

The patient has purulent sputum, and cultures have grown Strep pneumonia and sparse Klebsiella. He also has a fever, likely secondary to pneumonia, which is not covered by vancomycin. Therefore, vancomycin should be discontinued, and ceftriaxone should be started.

The patient's subdural hematoma was surgically evacuated on September 19th. He presented with unequal pupils on September 24th, but a stat head CT showed no interval change. Dilantin prophylaxis should continue, and a repeat head CT should be done in two weeks. The neurosurgeon should be consulted regarding the prognosis and mental status over the past week.

The patient's anemia of unclear et"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement, who was admitted after falling and suffering from subdural hemorrhage. The patient underwent neurosurgery evacuation of the bleed with herniation. The patient's course has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and now with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's fever spike overnight, hypoxia, and worsening chest X-ray prompted broadening of antibiotic coverage to include pseudomonas and MRSA. Blood cultures from 9/22 grew 4+ Strep pneumoniae and sparse klebsiella. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. Imaging reveals worsening infiltrates on the left side. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, pneumonia/fever, subdural hemorrhage, anemia, atrioventricular replacement/coagulopathy, altered mental status, diastolic heart failure, transaminitis, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypernatremia, benign pro"

   - per neurosurg, he is expected to regain some mental status, was able
   to follow commands prior to iintubation, but overall prognosis is poor.
   - f/u EEG to check for seizure activity
   - order f/u head Ct for change in setting of seizure.
   - neurosurg aware of seizure.
   Anemia: unclear etiology. Patient is hypercoaguable, s/p fall. Not
   bleeding in brain, may have spontaneous RP bleed. Hct went from 23 ->

   - discontinue heparin SC for now
   - will hold off on restarting warfarin and coumadin, will discuss with
   neurosurg
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia, uremia, and infection.
   will discuss with neurosurgery to assess trend of his exam over
   hospital course.
   Hypernatremia: has been trending up, likely contributing to mental

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement on Coumadin, and a recent subdural hemorrhage who is now in the ICU. He was admitted after falling and suffering a subdural hematoma, which required neurosurgery evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and pneumonia. He was initially intubated for respiratory failure but was extubated on September 20th. However, he was reintubated on September 24th due to increased work of breathing and airway protection in the setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 134/55 to 158/70 mmHg, heart rate between 60 and 62 bpm, respiratory rate between 16 and 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is unresponsive to commands and has a seizure-like episode with left arm activity. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient has purulent sputum and cultures have grown Strep pneumo and Klebsiella. His blood cultures are pending. The patient's lab results show elevated leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelets, and liver enzymes"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on coumadin, who suffered a fall resulting in a subdural hemorrhage and underwent neurosurgery for evacuation. The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure, and recently developed Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.

The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure caused by infectious and cardiogenic factors. Currently, he is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support is being adjusted based on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

The patient has a fever likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia, for which he is receiving vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics. Blood cultures and sputum culture are pending.

The patient experienced seizure-like activity of the left arm, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is being followed up to check for seizure activity. The head CT shows no significant change in the size or appearance of the subdural or intraparenchymal hemorrhages.

The patient has anemia of unclear etiology, which may be due to a spontaneous right posterior bleed or underlying myeloid metaplasia. The hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent fall resulting in a subdural hemorrhage that required neurosurgical evacuation. The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure due to infectious and cardiogenic causes, and then reintubated after experiencing increased work of breathing and airway protection in the setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes fever, pneumonia, subdural hemorrhage, seizure activity, anemia of unclear etiology, coagulopathy related to atrioventricular replacement and liver dysfunction, altered mental status, hypernatremia, resolving transaminitis, diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the underlying pulmonary edema and pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration, requiring close monitoring and appropriate interventions.
2. Pneumonia/Fever: The presence of fever and purulent sputum suggests an ongoing infectious process. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammatory response, and potential sepsis if not promptly managed.
3. Subdural hemorrhage: Although the recent head CT showed no change in the size or appearance of the subdural or intraparench"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  82 y/o M w/afib, s/p AVR, diastolic CHF, admitted with bilateral
   subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall now one week s/p
   evacuation, course complicated by reintubation.
   1.  Respiratory failure: Likely due to VAP.
   - treating with vanco and cefepime
   - attempt PSV although not ready for extubation given his mental status
   2. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
    - hold dilantin given elevated level
   - EEG prelim negative
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
   - cont metoprolol
   4. s/p AVR:  Not on anticoagulation due to subdural, but PT & PTT both
   elevated today.  Continue to hold anticoagulation for now.
   5. Coagulopathy:  Both INR and PTT are elevated, despite having been
   given multiple units of FFP during his hospital course.  DIC panel
   negative with normal fibrinogen and FDP.  Held SQ heparin although
   unlikely that he is systemically absorbing this.
   - DIC panel negative
   - restart SQ heparin
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.
   7. CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 2.0.  BUN higher than
   baseline, likely due to diuresis, now trending down.
   - renally dose meds
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160
   - hydralazine 37.5 mg TID
   - Imdur 20 [**Hospital1 **]
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   9. Atrial fibrillation:  Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   10. Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine.
   - TSH suppressed, check free T4
   11. Altered mental status:  Is unresponsive off of sedation.  Likely
   due to subdural as well as supratherapeutic dilantin.  EEG without
   active seizure activity.
   - holding dilantin
   12. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   13. Hypernatremia: Resolved.  Continue free water.
   14. Elevated LFTs: Now slightly improved.  Unclear etiology; no clear
   medications that should be causing this other than amiodarone but has
   been on this for quite some time and statin.
   - RUQ u/s unremarkable
   - hepatitis serologies negative
   - d/c statin
   15. Fevers:  Only source is VAP but is being treated for that.  Will
   repeat cultures.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to intracranial bleed.  Only indwelling
   line is a-line which is unlikely to be infected & blood cx negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is diagnosed with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with bilateral subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleeds after a fall. The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation for the subdural hematoma. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include a reintubation due to respiratory failure, which is suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime. An attempt at pressure support ventilation (PSV) was made, but the patient is not ready for extubation due to altered mental status.

The patient has a history of multiple admissions for diastolic CHF and appears relatively euvolemic with pulmonary infiltrates likely due to pneumonia or aspiration rather than CHF. Metoprolol has been continued for this condition.

The patient's post-aortic valve replacement status shows that he is not on anticoagulation due to subdural hematoma, but both PT and PTT are elevated today. Anticoagulation has been held for now.

The patient's coagulopathy is characterized by elevated INR and PTT, despite receiving multiple units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during his"

   video EEG telemetry in
   the waking and sleeping states due to the mildly slow and disorganized
   background rhythm of approximately 7 Hz rarely achieving an 8 Hz normal
   background rhythm. This is suggestive of a mild encephalopathy which
   may be seen with medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, or
   infections. There were no regions of focal slowing, no epileptiform
   discharges, and no electrographic seizures noted. There were no
   pushbutton activations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic. Patient is
   mildly alkalotic, is overbreathing the vent.
   - PSV trial yesterday, patient failed, became more alkalotic, so
   currently on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep this for now since
   unresponsive
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patient febrile to [**Age over 90 1287**] yesterday. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing coag
   positive staph, sensitivities pending. [**9-28**] sputum cx also gram stain
   gram + cocci
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**])
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])
   - will continue abx pending cultures

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on coumadin, who was admitted after falling and suffering from a subdural hematoma. The patient underwent neurosurgery to evacuate the bleed with herniation and has been experiencing respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever, altered mental status, anemia, coagulopathy related to anticoagulation for an artificial valve, hypernatremia, transaminitis, diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure, extubated on September 20th, and then re-intubated on September 24th due to increased work of breathing and airway protection in the setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The etiology of respiratory failure is identified as infectious and cardiogenic. The patient is mildly alkalotic and overbreathing the ventilator.

The patient has been febrile since September 24th, with cultures growing Streptococcus pneumoniae and sparse klebsiella. Sputum cultures also show coag positive staph, with sensitivities pending. Blood cultures are negative to date.

The patient had a seizure-like activity on September 26th and 27th, but head CT remained"

   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic. Patient is
   mildly alkalotic, is overbreathing the vent.
   - PSV trial yesterday, patient failed, became more alkalotic, so
   currently on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep this for now since

   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patient febrile to [**Age over 90 1287**] yesterday. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing coag
   positive staph, sensitivities above. [**9-28**] sputum cx also gram stain
   gram + cocci
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**])

   - holding  dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high given low albumin
   - per neurosurg, he is expected to regain some mental status, was able
   to follow commands prior to intubation, but overall prognosis is poor.
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal, see above
   Anemia: unclear etiology. Patient with high INR and s/p fall. Not
   bleeding in brain, may have spontaneous RP bleed. Hct went from 23 ->
   20 on [**9-24**] responded to 2 units pRBCs. Patient also has underlying

   units [**Month/Year (2) **]. and INR now down to 1.7. etiology of new coagulopathy
   unclear, but may be that intial [**Name (NI) **] wore off. likely from abnormal
   liver function.
   - will continue to monitor INR for now, is trending down slowly
   - INR <2, will start coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus
   per previous conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q6

   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed PSV trial [**9-28**], will stay on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep
   this for now since unresponsive
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensi kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**4-12**]
   - will continue abx pending cultures
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - holding dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high given low albumin
   - check with neurosurg regarding acceptable level for phenytoin and
   restart for tomorrow as needed
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stoolw
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valveWarfarin been
   held since admission for INR >2, INR now down to 1.7. persistently high
   INR likely from abnormal liver function or high dilantin levels
   - INR <2, will start coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus
   per previous conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q6
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.9
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on Coumadin, who was admitted after a fall with subdural hematoma and subsequently underwent neurosurgery evacuation. The patient has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable due to infectious and cardiogenic causes. He continues to have an increased work of breathing and airway protection issues.
2. Pneumonia/Fever: The patient's fever curve is coming down, but he still has positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella, which may require further antibiotic treatment.
3. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient had a craniotomy and evacuation for the subdural hematoma on 9/19. However, he experienced seizure-like activity in the left arm, and his head CT was unchanged. Phenytoin levels are high, and restarting it after checking the levels would be appropriate.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down since the transfusion on 9/24. Regular monitoring of Hcts is necessary, along with further evaluation of hemolysis labs, DIC, and iron studies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a significant medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to an infection in the lower extremity. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/64 mmHg to 142/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,050 mL and output of 2,510 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,540 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) infusion and has been receiving Coumadin at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 233 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.8 g/dL, blood glucose of 187 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 142 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 110 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.7 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) of 2.3 mg/dL. Liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are within normal range, while C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated at 52 mg/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.8 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 52 mmHg. The patient's platelet count is 233 K/uL, and prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated at 14.8, 30.6, and 1.3, respectively.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is currently being managed in the ICU for sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 450 mL, RR of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 160. The patient's fluid balance is positive by 1,540 mL, indicating potential fluid overload. His laboratory results show elevated WBC, blood glucose, and CR"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed PSV trial [**9-28**], will stay on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep
   this for now since unresponsive
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensi kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**5-12**]
   - will continue abx pending cultures
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - holding dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high corrected for low albumin
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, Warfarin been
   held since admission for INR >2, INR now down to 1.7. persistently high
   INR likely from abnormal liver function or high dilantin levels
   - INR <2, will start coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus
   per previous conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q6
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.9
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.
   BPH: holding  tamsulosin and finastride, as they are not crushable

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on Coumadin, who underwent neurosurgery for subdural hematoma with herniation after a fall. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever, subdural hemorrhage, anemia, coagulopathy, diastolic heart failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, transaminitis, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and worsening oxygenation will be important.

2. Bleeding: Due to the patient's coagulopathy and the use of Coumadin, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of INR levels and careful management of any procedures or interventions that could lead to bleeding will be necessary.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as Coumadin should be continued.

4. Diastolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or infection. Monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed PSV trial [**9-28**], will stay on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep
   this for now since unresponsive
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   - check ABG now: 7.49/36/309
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensi kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**5-12**].
   - will continue abx pending cultures
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - holding dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high corrected for low albumin
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 15 today, so held dilantin, check level in AM
   and likely dose at that time
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, Warfarin been
   held since admission for INR >2, INR now down to 1.7. persistently high
   INR likely from abnormal liver function or high dilantin levels
   - INR <2, will start coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus
   per previous conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level tomorrow (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   -          EEG: neg for sz
   -          Dilantin coming down
   -          Infection: being treated
   -          Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.9
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.
   BPH: holding  tamsulosin and finastride, as they are not crushable

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on Coumadin, who suffered a fall with subdural hematoma and underwent neurosurgery evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by diastolic heart failure exacerbation, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure due to infectious and cardiogenic causes. He remains on mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about overbreathing and slight alkalosis. The ABG results show a pH of 7.49, which indicates alkalosis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella species. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient remains at risk for worsening infection.

3. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient had a craniotomy and evacuation for subdural hemorrhage on 9/19. There were episodes of seizure-like activity, but the head CT was unchanged. Dilantin levels were high, and the medication was held.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down since the last transfusion. The underlying cause may be myeloid metaplasia. Daily monitoring of Hcts is recommended, along with further investigation into hemolysis labs, DIC"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and was admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds after a fall. The patient's course has been complicated by reintubation for respiratory failure and pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.7°C (101.6°F)
- Heart rate: 60 bpm
- Blood pressure: 133/66 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on supplemental oxygen

The patient is intubated and sedated. Physical examination findings include PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), EOMI (eyes open to mild pressure), clear lung sounds with rhonchi bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and mild extremity edema.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including:
1. Respiratory failure: Likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and/or aspiration.
2. Persistent fevers: Most likely due to pneumonia, but other sources should be considered.
3. Subdural hematoma: The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation, and head CTs have been stable despite systemic anticoagulation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and was admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds after a fall. The patient also had respiratory failure requiring reintubation and developed pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), subdural hematoma, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), coagulopathy/anticoagulation, anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), altered mental status, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, altered mental status, hyperlipidemia, hypernatremia, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if VAP or aspiration is not effectively managed.
2. Persistent fevers: The patient's fevers may indicate ongoing infection, potentially related to pneumonia or another source.
3. Subdural hematoma: Although the head CTs have been stable, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding or complications from the subdural hematoma.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates suggest possible aspiration or pneumonia rather than CHF. However, there is still a risk of exacerbation"

   82 y/o M w/afib, s/p AVR, diastolic CHF, admitted with bilateral
   subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall now one week s/p
   evacuation, course complicated by reintubation for resp failure/pna.
   1.  Respiratory failure: Likely due to VAP +/- aspiration, cxr with
   persistent infiltrates
   PS attempted, but hypoventilation.  Has not been sedated.  Now
   restarted AC
    - Vanc day 8, trough 9.8 so will increase to q 24
    - cefepime day [**5-12**]
    - if persistent purulent sputum will recheck sputum cx
   2. Persistent fevers: likely [**2-5**] pna, will cont monitor blood cx,
   change lines if + blood cx
   3. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
   - continue to hold dilantin given elevated level although now is near
   therapeutic - goal [**10-24**], now 15, will recheck [**10-3**]
   - EEG w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
    - cont metoprolol
   5. Coagulopathy/anticoagulation:  INR and PTT are improving on their
   own.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to interaction with dilantin.  Will restart
   coumadin at lower dose than home dose.  INR 1.3.  Will start coumadin 1
   mg tonight and continue to adjustbased on INR, dilantin dose
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.  No current indication for
   transfusion.  Will transfuse if symptomatic or hct < 21
   7. CKD: At baseline.
    8. Altered mental status: poor interaction off sedation, unchanged,
   likely multifactorial related to sdh, critical illness
   9. Hyponatremia: Na improving, was getting fwb q 4 h, will change to q
   6 H
   10. transaminitis resolving
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160
   - hydralazine 37.5 mg TID
   - Imdur 20 [**Hospital1 **]
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   9. Atrial fibrillation:  Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   10. Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine.
   - TSH suppressed, check free T4  (TSH was 0.04, T4 was 5.6)
   11. Altered mental status:  Is minimally responsive off of sedation.
   Likely due to subdural.  EEG without active seizure activity.  Mental
   status not improved with lower dilantin level.
   - holding dilantin
   12. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   13. Hypernatremia: Resolved.  Continue free water.
   14. Elevated LFTs: Improved, likely [**2-5**] dilantin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and was diagnosed with diastolic congestive heart failure. He was admitted due to bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds resulting from a fall, and subsequently underwent evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by reintubation for respiratory failure and pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration, with persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray. Sedation has been restarted, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be indicative of a secondary infection. Blood cultures have been monitored, and lines have been changed if positive.
3. Subdural Hematoma: The patient had a craniotomy and evacuation for the subdural hematoma, which has been stable despite systemic anticoagulation.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient appears relatively euvolemic, and pulmonary infiltrates are likely due to pneumonia rather than CHF.
5. Coagulopathy/Anticoagulation: The patient's INR and PTT are improving on their own, but there was a drug interaction with dilantin. Coumadin has been restarted at a lower dose, and adjustments will be based"

   2. Persistent fevers: likely [**2-5**] pna, will cont monitor blood cx,
   change lines if + blood cx
   3. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
   - continue to hold dilantin given elevated level although now is near
   therapeutic - goal [**10-24**], now 15, will recheck [**10-3**]
   - EEG w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
    - cont metoprolol
   5. Coagulopathy/anticoagulation:  INR and PTT are improving on their
   own.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to interaction with dilantin.  Will restart
   coumadin at lower dose than home dose.  INR 1.3.  Will start coumadin 1
   mg tonight and continue to adjustbased on INR, dilantin dose
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.  No current indication for
   transfusion.  Will transfuse if symptomatic or hct < 21
   7. CKD: At baseline.
    8. Altered mental status: poor interaction off sedation, unchanged,
   likely multifactorial related to sdh, critical illness
   9. Hyponatremia: Na improving, was getting fwb q 4 h, will change to q
   6 H
   10. transaminitis resolving
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160
   - hydralazine 37.5 mg TID
   - Imdur 20 [**Hospital1 **]
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   9. Atrial fibrillation:  Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   10. Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine.
   - TSH suppressed, check free T4  (TSH was 0.04, T4 was 5.6)
   11. Altered mental status:  Is minimally responsive off of sedation.
   Likely due to subdural.  EEG without active seizure activity.  Mental
   status not improved with lower dilantin level.
   - holding dilantin
   12. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   13. Hypernatremia: Resolved.  Continue free water.
   14. Elevated LFTs: Improved, likely [**2-5**] dilantin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is currently in the ICU.
- The patient has been admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds after falling and experiencing respiratory failure/pneumonia.
- The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.
- The patient's subdural hematoma has been evacuated, but head CTs have been stable despite systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and is euvolemic with pulmonary infiltrates likely due to pneumonia/aspiration rather than CHF.
- The patient's coagulation status is improving on its own, but there is an interaction with dilantin.
- The patient has anemia due to acute chest syndrome (ACD), with negative hemolysis labs, and no current indication for transfusion.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline.
- The patient has altered mental status, likely multifactorial, related to subdural hematoma and critical illness.
- The patient's sodium levels are improving, but they were getting free water by mouth every 4 hours."

   subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall now one week s/p
   evacuation, course complicated by reintubation for resp failure/pna.
   1.  Respiratory failure: Likely due to VAP +/- aspiration, cxr with
   persistent infiltrates
   PS attempted, but hypoventilation.  Has not been sedated.  Now
   restarted AC
    - Vanc day 8, trough 9.8 so will increase to q 24
    - cefepime day [**5-12**]
    - if persistent purulent sputum will recheck sputum cx
   2. Persistent fevers: likely [**2-5**] pna, will cont monitor blood cx,
   change lines if + blood cx
   3. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
   - continue to hold dilantin given elevated level although now is near
   therapeutic - goal [**10-24**], now 15, will recheck [**10-3**]
   - EEG w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
    - cont metoprolol
   5. Coagulopathy/anticoagulation:  INR and PTT are improving on their
   own.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to interaction with dilantin.  Will restart
   coumadin at lower dose than home dose.  INR 1.3.  Will start coumadin 1
   mg tonight and continue to adjustbased on INR, dilantin dose
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.  No current indication for
   transfusion.  Will transfuse if symptomatic or hct < 21
   7. CKD: At baseline.
    8. Altered mental status: poor interaction off sedation, unchanged,
   likely multifactorial related to sdh, critical illness
   9. Hyponatremia: Na improving, was getting fwb q 4 h, will change to q
   6 H
   10. transaminitis resolving
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160

   - TSH suppressed, check free T4  (TSH was 0.04, T4 was 5.6)
   11. Altered mental status:  Is minimally responsive off of sedation.
   Likely due to subdural.  EEG without active seizure activity.  Mental
   status not improved with lower dilantin level.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and was admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds after a fall.
- The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and the current course of treatment has been complicated by reintubation for respiratory failure/pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and/or aspiration, with persistent infiltrates seen on chest X-ray.
- The patient has persistent fevers, which are likely due to [2-5] pneumonia, and will continue to monitor blood cultures and change lines if positive.
- The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation for subdural hematoma, and head CTs have been stable despite systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient's diastolic CHF appears relatively euvolemic, and pulmonary infiltrates are more likely due to pneumonia/aspiration rather than CHF.
- The patient has coagulopathy/anticoagulation with INR and PTT improving on their own, possibly due to interaction with dilantin. Coumadin will be restarted at a lower dose.
- The patient has anemia with Hct now stable, likely due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o M w/afib, s/p AVR, diastolic CHF, admitted with bilateral
   subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall now one week s/p
   evacuation, course complicated by reintubation for resp failure/pna.
   Overall course minimally changed. He continues to have marginal MS [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 2167**]ing aspiration, though vent requirements, BP, HR unchanged.
   1.  Respiratory failure: Likely due to VAP +/- aspiration, cxr with
   increasing infiltrates due to probable ongoing aspiration
   PS attempted, but hypoventilation.  Has not been sedated.  Now
   restarted AC
    - Vanc day 8, trough 9.8 so will increase to q 24
    - cefepime day [**5-12**]
    - if persistent purulent sputum will recheck sputum cx
   2. Persistent fevers: likely [**2-5**] pna, will cont monitor blood cx,
   change lines if + blood cx
   3. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
   - continue to hold dilantin given elevated level although now is near
   therapeutic - goal [**10-24**], now 15, will recheck [**10-3**]
   - EEG w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
    - cont metoprolol
   5. Coagulopathy/anticoagulation:  INR and PTT are improving on their
   own.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to interaction with dilantin.  Will restart
   coumadin at lower dose than home dose.  INR 1.3.  Will start coumadin 1
   mg tonight and continue to adjustbased on INR, dilantin dose
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.  No current indication for
   transfusion.  Will transfuse if symptomatic or hct < 21
   7. CKD: At baseline.
    8. Altered mental status: poor interaction off sedation, unchanged,
   likely multifactorial related to sdh, critical illness
   9. Hyponatremia: Na improving, was getting fwb q 4 h, will change to q
   6 H
   10. transaminitis resolving
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160
   - hydralazine 37.5 mg TID
   - Imdur 20 [**Hospital1 **]
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   9. Atrial fibrillation:  Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   10. Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine.
   - TSH suppressed, check free T4  (TSH was 0.04, T4 was 5.6)
   11. Altered mental status:  Is minimally responsive off of sedation.
   Likely due to subdural.  EEG without active seizure activity.  Mental
   status not improved with lower dilantin level.
   - holding dilantin
   12. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   13. Hypernatremia: Resolved.  Continue free water.
   14. Elevated LFTs: Improved, likely [**2-5**] dilantin.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - will try pressure support trial again today, failed PSV trial [**9-28**]
   [**2-5**] to alkalosis. Has been stable on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, for several
   days
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensitive kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**6-12**].
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - will start dilantin at 50mg daily as level is in normal range today.
   Will check levels qAM
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 today
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**]
   continue coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus per previous
   conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level daily (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status: Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   - Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.8
   - redoes meds for improving creatinine
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed PSV trial [**9-28**], will stay on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep
   this for now since unresponsive
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   - check ABG now: 7.49/36/309
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensi kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**6-12**].
   - will continue abx pending cultures
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - holding dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high corrected for low albumin
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 today, so held dilantin, check level in AM
   and likely dose at that time
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**]
   continue coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus per previous
   conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level tomorrow (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   -  Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.8
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.
   BPH: holding  tamsulosin and finastride, as they are not crushable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement on Coumadin. He was admitted after falling and experiencing subdural hematoma, which required neurosurgical evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure and was later extubated. However, he was reintubated after experiencing increased work of breathing and airway protection due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The etiology of the respiratory failure is attributed to both infectious and cardiogenic causes.

The patient's fever curve is decreasing, and cultures have grown Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella species. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime has been initiated, and it will be continued until the completion of an 8-day course of cefepime.

The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the subdural hematoma on 9/19. He exhibited seizure-like activity in the left arm, but a head CT showed no changes. His pupils have been sluggish, but the CT remains unchanged. Dilation levels have been high, so it is being held, and levels will be monitored daily.

The patient has a history of myeloid metaplasia and has been experiencing a declining hemoglobin level since a transfusion on 9/24. His Hct is trending down daily. Iron studies indicate iron deficiency with a low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). He will continue to have his Hcts checked daily.

The patient has an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and requires anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. The target International Normalized Ratio (INR) is between 2-6. He received a dose of Coumadin today, and his INR level will be checked tomorrow.

Diastolic heart failure is also present, with an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 60%. The patient was on a Lasix drip and is currently euvolemic. Joint venous pressure (JVP) assessment is difficult.

The patient has altered mental status and is unresponsive even without sedation. The etiology is likely multifactorial, including subdural hematoma, hypernatremia (which has resolved), uremia, infection, and high dilantin levels. EEG results are negative for seizures.

Hypernatremia is resolving, and the patient's sodium level is coming into normal range. Transaminitis is also resolving, and an ultrasound showed hepatic congestion as the likely etiology. The patient's creatinine level is improving from baseline.

Hypertension is now better controlled with medications including hydralazine, isosorbide mononitrate, and metoprolol. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed PSV trial [**9-28**], will stay on AC 50%/ 450/ 14/ 5, will keep
   this for now since unresponsive
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   - check ABG now: 7.49/36/309
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensi kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**6-12**].
   - will continue abx pending cultures
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - holding dilantin and level at more normal range. Will check levels
   qAM, levels very high corrected for low albumin
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 today, so held dilantin, check level in AM
   and likely dose at that time
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**]
   continue coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus per previous
   conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level tomorrow (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status:  Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   -  Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.8
   - renally dose meds
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.
   BPH: holding  tamsulosin and finastride, as they are not crushable

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement, diastolic congestive heart failure, and myeloid metaplasia. He was admitted after a fall with subdural hematoma and underwent neurosurgery evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, subdural hemorrhage, anemia, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, altered mental status, and transaminitis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to infectious and cardiogenic causes. He remains slightly alkalotic due to neurologic tachypnea. The ABG results show a pH of 7.49, indicating a need for further monitoring and possible adjustment of ventilator settings.
2. Pneumonia/Fever: The patient's fever curve is coming down, but he has positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime is ongoing. Follow-up cultures will be necessary to determine if there is any improvement.
3. Subdural Hemorrhage: The patient had a craniotomy and evacuation of subdural hematoma on [9-19]. There have been no significant changes on subsequent CT scans. Se"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, and previous admission for bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds following a fall. The patient underwent evacuation of the subdural hematomas. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and/or aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to VAP and/or aspiration. Treatment includes adjusting antibiotics, elevating the head of bed, and performing sputum cultures if purulent secretions persist.

2. Persistent Fevers: The patient's fevers are likely related to a secondary infection, possibly pneumonia. Monitoring blood cultures and changing lines if positive is recommended.

3. Subdural Hematoma: The patient had a craniotomy and evacuation for subdural hematomas. Head CTs have been stable despite systemic anticoagulation. Dilantin levels need to be monitored, and an EEG should be performed to rule out toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.

4. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient appears relatively euvolemic, and pulmonary infiltrates are more likely due to pneumonia/aspiration rather than CHF. Continuing metoprol"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o M w/afib, s/p AVR, diastolic CHF, admitted with bilateral
   subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall now one week s/p
   evacuation, course complicated by reintubation for resp failure/pna.
   Overall course minimally changed. He continues to have marginal MS [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 2167**]ing aspiration, though vent requirements, BP, HR unchanged.
   1.  Respiratory failure: Likely due to VAP +/- aspiration, cxr with
   improving infiltrates.  On AC with improving oxygenation/
    - Vanc day 8, trough 9.8 so will increase to q 24
    - cefepime day [**5-12**]
    - if persistent purulent sputum will recheck sputum cx
    - Vanc dosing adjusted for low trough, will f/u level today
   2. Persistent fevers: likely [**2-5**] pna, will cont monitor blood cx,
   change lines if + blood cx, currently have been negative
   3. Subdural hematoma: s/p craniotomy and evacuation.  Head CTs have
   been stable despite what effectively is systemic anticoagulation
   (elevated INR and PTT).
   - continue to hold dilantin given elevated level although now is near
   therapeutic - goal [**10-24**], was 10 on [**10-2**]
   - will start dilantin 50 mg
   - EEG w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   3. Diastolic CHF: s/p multiple admissions for this in past.  Appears
   relatively euvolemic and pulmonary infiltrates likely
   pneumonia/aspiration as opposed to CHF.
    - cont metoprolol
   5. Coagulopathy/anticoagulation:  INR and PTT are improving on their
   own.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to interaction with dilantin.  Will restart
   coumadin at lower dose than home dose.  INR 1.3.  Will start coumadin 1
   mg tonight and continue to adjustbased on INR, dilantin dose.
    - will continue coumadin 1 mg and f/u INR in am
    - goal [**2-6**] [**2-5**] [**Hospital3 **] avr
   6. Anemia:  Hct now stable.  Anemia labs c/w ACD, has hx of abnl bone
   marrow biopsy.  Hemolysis labs negative.  No current indication for
   transfusion.  Will transfuse if symptomatic or hct < 21
   7. CKD: At baseline.
    8. Altered mental status: poor interaction off sedation, unchanged,
   likely multifactorial related to sdh, critical illness
   9. Hyponatremia: Na improving, was getting fwb q 4 h, will change to q
   6 H
   10. transaminitis resolving
   8. Hypertension: Given bleed, goal SBP <160
   - hydralazine 37.5 mg TID
   - Imdur 20 [**Hospital1 **]
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   9. Atrial fibrillation:  Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   10. Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine.
   - TSH suppressed, check free T4  (TSH was 0.04, T4 was 5.6)
   11. Altered mental status:  Is minimally responsive off of sedation.
   Likely due to subdural.  EEG without active seizure activity.  Mental
   status not improved with lower dilantin level.
   - holding dilantin
   12. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   13. Hypernatremia: Resolved.  Continue free water.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and developed bilateral subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeds after a fall. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's course has been complicated by reintubation, persistent fevers, and marginal mental status with aspiration risk. His vital signs remain stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. Laboratory results show ongoing inflammation, elevated liver enzymes, and altered coagulation profile. Imaging reveals improving infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, insulin, allopurinol, atrovent, colace, folic acid, MVI, synthroid, Pepcid, isordil, cefepime, hydralazine, and Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration. Current management includes antibiotics, improved oxygenation, and consideration for sputum culture.
2. Persistent fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may indicate ongoing infection or sepsis. Close monitoring of blood cultures and consideration for line changes if positive.
3. Subdural hematoma: Although the patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation, there is a risk of recurrence or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed pressure support trial again [**10-3**] secondary to tachypnea,
   failed PSV trial [**9-28**] [**2-5**] to alkalosis. Has been stable on AC 50%/ 450/
   14/ 5, for several days
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   - Pending family meeting, he may be extubated today.
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensitive kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**7-12**].
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - will start dilantin at 50mg daily as level is in normal range today.
   Will check levels qAM
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 yesterday
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**]
   continue coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus per previous
   conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level daily (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status: Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   - Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and diastolic congestive heart failure. He was admitted after falling and experiencing subdural hematoma, which required neurosurgery evacuation. The patient's condition has been complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He was initially intubated for respiratory failure but was extubated on [**9-20**]. He was reintubated on [**9-24**] due to increased work of breathing and airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is infectious and cardiogenic in nature. He remains slightly alkalotic due to neurologic tachypnea. He failed pressure support trials and spontaneous breathing trials due to tachypnea and alkalosis.
2. Pneumonia/Fever: The patient's fever curve is coming down. Cultures from [**9-24**] grew Streptococcus pneumoniae and sparse Klebsiella. Sputum cultures on [**9-26**] grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and pansensitive Klebsiella. Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending. Vancomycin and cefepime therapy will continue until completion of the 8-day course.

   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - will start dilantin at 50mg daily as level is in normal range today.
   Will check levels qAM
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 yesterday
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily. hemolysis labs, DIC: negative. iron studies:
   iron deficient but TIBC is low
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**].
   without bolus given head bleed.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level daily (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status: Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   - Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.7
   - redoes meds for improving creatinine
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is am 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and AVR on
   coumadin, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted after fall with SDH
   and is now s/p neurosurgery evacuation ([**9-19**]) for bleed with hernation,
   course complicated by diastolic CHF exacerbation, and now with VAP
   Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for [**Doctor First Name 213**] [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
   ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing
   and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
   Etiology of resp failure is infectious and cardiogenic.
   - patient overbreathing vent, likely will remain slightly alkalotic
   because of neurologic tachypnea
   - failed pressure support trial again [**10-3**] secondary to tachypnea,
   failed PSV trial [**9-28**] [**2-5**] to alkalosis. Has been stable on AC 50%/ 450/
   14/ 5, for several days
   - no currently on sedation, not responsive to command
   - Pending family meeting, he may be extubated today.
   Pneumonia/Fever: Patients fever curve coming down. Culture from [**9-24**]
   grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum growing MSSA
   and pansensitive kelbs.
   - followup all blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (day 1: [**9-24**]) continue until 8 day course of cefepime is
   complete
   - cefepime (day 1 [**9-27**])  total 8 day course. Today [**7-12**].
   - will resite a-line if his blood cultures are positive.
   Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
   emergently. [**9-26**] and [**9-27**] AM, had seizure like activity of the left
   arm, head CT unchanged. [**9-24**] sluggish  pupil, CT unchanged
   - will start dilantin at 50mg daily as level is in normal range today.
   Will check levels qAM
   - EEG: no epileptiform activity, but mildly abnormal
   - Corrected dilantin ~ 10 yesterday
   Anemia: Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. Has been slowly
   trending down since transfusion on [**9-24**]. Hct trending down daily, 22.6
   today. Will monitor daily
   -  continue to check Hcts daily
   - hemolysis labs, DIC: negative
   - iron studies: iron deficient but TIBC is low
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse Hct < 21
   AVR/Coagulpathy: patient with AVR with [**Hospital3 1974**] valve, goal INR [**2-6**]
   continue coumadin because of AVR, without heparin or bolus per previous
   conversations between cardiology and neurosurgery.
   - goal INR [**2-6**].
   - dose Coumadin 1mg today, check level daily (pt recently
   coagulopathic)
   Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix drip. on
   torsemide 20mg daily at home. currently looks euvolemic. JVP is
   diffucult to assess
   - Goal I/O -1L. looks wet today, Lasix 20mg IV, repeat as needed
   Altered mental status: Patient unresponsive off sedation.  Etiology is
   likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia (resolved), uremia, and
   infection. Also high dilantin level as part of AMS . Per neurology, was
   following commands prior to intubation.
   - EEG: neg for sz
   - Dilantin coming down
   - Infection: being treated
   - Na: improving
   Hypernatremia: resolving, likely contributing to mental status
   - decrease free water boluses from 300ccq4 to q8 as Na coming into
   normal range
   Transaminitis: Resolving. u/s showing congestion, likely etiology.
   Previous shock liver, hepatitis panel normal
   - will trend LFTs
 now trending down
   - right upper quad u/s: hepatic congestion
   CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. currently 1.7
   - redoes meds for improving creatinine
   Hypertension: now better controlled, BP ranges from 110-130 systolic.
   - continue  Hydralazine to 37.5mg TID
   - Isosorbide mononitrate 20 PO BID
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   Atrial fibrillation:
   Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypothyroidism: TSH low, 0.08, T4 5.6 (normal)
   - continue home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine
   HYperlipidemia: discontinue statin in setting of liver damage.
   BPH: holding  tamsulosin and finastride, as they are not crushable

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin, who was admitted after falling and experiencing subdural hemorrhage. He underwent neurosurgery evacuation of the bleed with herniation. The patient's course has been complicated by diastolic heart failure exacerbation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure due to infectious and cardiogenic causes. He was extubated on [**9-20**] but re-intubated on [**9-24**] after experiencing increased work of breathing and airway protection in the setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. He remains slightly alkalotic due to neurologic tachypnea and has failed pressure support trials and PSV trial due to tachypnea and alkalosis.

The patient's fever curve is coming down, and cultures from [**9-24**] grew 4+ Strep pneumo and sparse klebsiella. [**9-26**] sputum grew MSSA and pansensitive klebsiella. Vancomycin will continue until an 8-day course of cefepime is complete, and cefepime will be given for a total of 8 days.

The patient had a seizure-like activity of the left arm, but head CT remained unchanged. He is starting dilantin at 50"
