","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of esophageal varices and encephalitis. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 99/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion and other medications in the ICU.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a weight loss of 7 kg since admission, fluid balance with a total input of 121 mL and output of 810 mL, including urine output of 810 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and oxygen through an endotracheal tube on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's respiratory support parameters are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are not available due to the patient's inability to protect their airway. Neurologic examination is also not assessed at this time.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 79 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, high blood glucose level of 147 mg/dL, and"

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV, peripheral edema, history of SBP and portal and PAH, with recurrent episodes of encephalopathy. He presented after vomiting and aspirating, and is currently intubated and minimally responsive.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Aspiration: Although the patient appears to have avoided true aspiration, there is still a risk due to his current intubation and sedated state.

2. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient has a history of recurrent encephalopathy episodes, with the trigger unknown. It is important to monitor and manage his hepatic encephalopathy by restarting lactulose every 4 hours and rifaximin 400 mg three times a day.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has a history of SBP, and prophylactic antibiotics (Cipro IV) have been started. The antibiotic regimen will be changed to oral once the patient is extubated.

4. Esophageal varices: The patient has known grade II varices that were previously banded without evidence of active bleeding. It is important to continue monitoring his condition and consider paracentesis to relieve portal hypertension.

5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has portal and pulmonary hypertension, and iloprost inhalation therapy will be continued under respiratory therapy guidance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, peripheral edema, previous episodes of encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy. He presented with vomiting and aspiration, leading to the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been sedated and is currently stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient's mental status and vomiting suggest an inability to protect his airway, which led to intubation.
2. Recurrent encephalopathy: The trigger for the recurrent episodes is unknown, and the patient has negative blood and urine cultures.
3. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has a history of alcohol use, hepatitis C, ascites, peripheral edema, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be addressed.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely due to liver disease.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires levothyroxine supplementation.
7. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient needs to continue with iloprost inhalation therapy.
8. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient is currently intubated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old individual with a history of ETOH/HCV cirrhosis, OSA, and recurrent encephalopathy. They were admitted to the floor on [date] with encephalopathy and subsequently brought to the MICU after experiencing worsening mental status (MS), vomiting, and aspiration. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on invasive ventilation. They have persistent right-sided gaze, but a negative head CT for acute bleed.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/67 to 118/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications including pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin, levoxyl, rifaximin, and lactulose.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the worsening MS. Flowsheet data shows adequate fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 24, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.23.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, normal pupils, clear breath sounds, distended and firm abdomen, and peripheral pulses within normal limits. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to intubation. Laboratory results indicate stable renal function, elevated liver enzymes, normal electrolytes, and decreased albumin levels. Imaging shows no intracranial hemorrhage or pulmonary infiltrates.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Esophageal varices: No current evidence of bleeding.
2. Encephalopathy: Recurrent bouts of encephalopathy. Unclear what else can be done to prevent this will discuss with hepatology.
3. Respiratory failure: Will stop propofol and attempt to extubate.
4. Cirrhosis/ascites: Will discuss with hepatology about need for tap.
5. ICU care: Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's history of recurrent encephalopathy indicates a potential risk for further episodes, which can lead to altered mental status and respiratory compromise.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure poses a significant risk, especially since they are on invasive ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis and encephalitis. The patient underwent an invasive ventilation procedure and subsequently developed apnea, requiring extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 1,639 mL since midnight. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and lactic acid levels. The patient's imaging reveals no acute process on chest X-ray. The patient's microbiology results show no evidence of infection. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to airway compromise and has a risk for venous thromboembolism (DVT). The patient's disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect the airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's large tidal volumes and decreased respiratory rate may indicate inadequate ventilation, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Hepatic encephal"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis, peripheral edema, previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal hypertension, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). He presents with recurrent episodes of encephalopathy and vomiting, leading to aspiration and subsequent intubation.

- The patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis that did not show evidence of SBP, but a therapeutic paracentesis removed 3 liters of ascitic fluid. Macrophages were found in the ascitic fluid, but their significance is unclear.

- The patient was placed on noninvasive ventilation due to episodes of apnea and large tidal volumes overnight. He demanded extubation and oral-gastric tube removal, which were eventually granted. The patient became more awake overnight and is now extubated.

- Allergies include amoxicillin, adhesive bandage (topical), and dicloxacillin.

- The patient has received various medications, including ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events.

- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/70 to 98/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and recurrent encephalopathy. He was extubated this morning and appears to be doing well. The patient underwent a paracentesis, which showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was also taken off invasive ventilation. The patient has allergies to amoxicillin, adhesive bandage, and dicloxacillin. His last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C, previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal and pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. His mental status is improving with lactulose/acidophilus treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient has a history of severe encephalopathy, which is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Hepatitis C: The patient has a known history of hepatitis C infection, which can lead to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis over time. This increases the risk of complications such as liver failure, esophageal varices, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
3. Esophageal varices: Due to portal hypertension, the patient may develop esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus. These varices can rupture and lead to severe bleeding, requiring urgent intervention.
4. Airway protection: The patient has difficulty protecting his airway due to altered mental status, increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration precautions should be continued to prevent this complication.
5. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of sleep apnea, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C, who presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. He had no evidence of aspiration, vomiting, or inability to protect his airway. His mental status continues to improve. The patient has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal and pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy. He is currently receiving lactulose for encephalopathy, rifaximin, lactobacillus supplementation, ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis, and aspiration precautions. The patient demanded the removal of the nasogastric tube and is now able to take oral medications. The attending physician agrees with the resident's note and plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient has a history of severe encephalopathy and is currently being treated with lactulose. However, there is a risk of recurrent episodes, especially if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Aspiration: Although the patient does not currently have any signs of airway compromise, his altered mental status puts him at risk for aspiration. Aspiration precautions are in place, but careful monitoring is required.
3. SBP: The patient has a history of SBP and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Monitoring for signs of infection and close surveillance of his abdominal fluid accumulation are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C, who presents with recurrent episodes of encephalopathy. He has no evidence of aspiration, vomiting, or inability to protect his airway. His mental status is improving on transfer with stooling. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 69-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55-135/92 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, scleral icterus, distended abdomen with shifting dullness, firmness, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows non-responsive behavior and rotating pupils. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and metabolic abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and recurrent episodes of encephalopathy suggest a high risk for further episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Esophageal varices: The patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of ascites and peripheral edema increase the risk of esophageal varices. These varices can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's mental status has returned to baseline. The nasogastric (NG), rectal, and Foley catheter have been removed at the patient's request. Monitoring for encephalopathy is ongoing. Provisil dosage has been increased to 200mg, while rifaximin has been discontinued. The patient became unresponsive at 4:30am while on CPAP, with no evidence of aspiration. The NG tube was replaced, and aspirated lactulose from the 2am dose was given. Additional lactulose was administered, along with Reglan to increase motility. Ammonia level is at 504.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Elevated ammonia level indicates a potential risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and neurological dysfunction due to liver dysfunction.
2. Esophageal varices: The presence of esophageal varices increases the risk of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be life-threatening.
3. Airway management issues: The patient's inability to protect their own airway poses a risk for aspiration and impaired gag reflex, potentially leading to respiratory complications.
4. Infection: Given the high ammonia level, there is an increased risk of infection, particularly in the presence of hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent complications related to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, secondary to alcohol and HCV, and recurrent episodes of encephalopathy. He presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. His mental status is improving, and he has no evidence of aspiration, vomiting, or inability to protect his airway. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 110/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range. Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, scleral icterus, distended abdomen with shifting dullness, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows mild left pupil dilation. Laboratory results indicate elevated ammonia levels, low albumin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has multiple comorbidities including ESLD, sleep apnea, portal hypertension, and chronic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's recurrent episodes of encephalopathy are most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for signs of recurrent encephalopathy and adjusting lactulose dosage to achieve a goal of 750-1000mL stool output are necessary.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the risk of aspiration and inability to protect his airway, aspiration precautions should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C, previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal and pulmonary hypertension, and severe encephalopathy. He presented with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. His mental status has improved, but he experienced a worse episode overnight with persistent encephalopathy and an elevated ammonia level of 504. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's high ammonia level indicates ongoing liver dysfunction, which can lead to recurrent episodes of encephalopathy.
2. Aspiration: Due to altered mental status and inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Esophageal varices: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which are at risk for bleeding, especially during episodes of encephalopathy.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to the development of hepatic hydrothorax, a type of pleural effusion caused by transudation of ascitic fluid into the pleural space.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: Advanced liver disease can result in hepatorenal syndrome, a form of kidney failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and HCV. He has had previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger, but his mental status is improving with lactulose administration. The patient's current conditions include ESLD (end-stage liver disease), anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, pulmonary hypertension, OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), and FEN (nothing by mouth except for medications).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's history of severe encephalopathy indicates a potential risk for recurrent episodes, which can lead to altered mental status and respiratory compromise.
2. Ascites: The patient's ascites may increase in severity, leading to abdominal distension and potential complications such as infection or liver rupture.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has a history of SBP, which is a common and potentially life-threatening infection in patients with cirrhosis. Monitoring for signs of infection and timely administration of antibiotics are crucial.
4. Portal hypertension: The patient has a history of portal hypertension, which can lead to variceal bleeding and other complications. Regular monitoring of blood pressure in the portal system and prophylactic measures may be necessary.
5. Pulmonary hypertension:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C. He has a past medical history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. His mental status has improved with lactulose administration. He is currently on lactulose, rifaximin, Lactobacillus, branched-chain amino acids, ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, and aspiration precautions. The patient also has esophageal varices that have been previously banded, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, pulmonary hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's history of severe encephalopathy and the current episode indicate a risk for recurrent episodes. Close monitoring of mental status and timely administration of lactulose are crucial.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal varices. Monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as hematemesis or melena, and regular guaiac stool testing are important.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis increases the risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and maintaining lactulose dosing are important to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including liver cirrhosis, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic with low blood glucose levels. Initial laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient's mental status improved after receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. However, the patient still has a slow stool output and is at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect his airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. It is crucial to monitor the patient's neurologic status and continue with appropriate treatment measures such as lactulose administration and avoiding precipitating factors.
2. Esophageal varices: The patient's history of liver cirrhosis puts him at risk for esophageal varices, which are dilated veins in the esophagus that can rupture and lead to severe bleeding. Continuous monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic measures like nonselective beta-blockers may be necessary.
3. Airway protection: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration. Intensive care unit (IC"

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C. He has a past medical history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal hypertension, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. His mental status has improved since admission, but he still has an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal CPAP. He is somnolent but arousable to noxious stimuli, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not documented. 

Physical examination findings include dry mucous membranes, scleral icterus, distended abdomen with shifting dullness, firmness, and positive bowel sounds. There is also 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination reveals a left pupil that is mildly more dilated than the right, chronic and moving all extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, sodium level of 117 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 14"
