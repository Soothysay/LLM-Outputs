   and plan of care.
   Chief Complaint:  Hypoxemia x 2 days
   HPI:
   Briefly 80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, gastroparesis, Stage IV sarcoidosis,
   and poorly controlled COPD.  She has a 2 year history of multiple
   abdominal surgeries: initially a sigmoid resection for large bowel
   obstruction c/b anastomotic leak and multiple episodes of
   intra-abdominal abscesses requiring surgical correction and revision,
   diverticulitis with colovesicular fistula in [**2169**] that required partial
   colonic resection and an ileostomy. In [**2170-12-4**], she had the ileostomy
   reversed and since then, she has had worsening of her diarrhea.
   Since [**Month (only) **], she has been admitted to OSH 5 times for long hospital stays
   with extensive work up that has been negative so far. Most recently,
   she was admitted to OSH [**3-27**] where workup again has been negative. She
   has been getting IVF; lasix held. The family requested a transfer to
   [**Hospital1 19**] this for a 2nd opinion at a [**Hospital 7454**] care center for her GI
   symptoms.  Two hours prior to transfer she developed gradually
   worsening dyspnea and an oxygen requirement.
   She was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on supplemental oxygen. On arrival to the
   floor, she required 6LNC and was saturating 88%. ABG showed paO2 of 54.
   CXR was consistent with significant pulm edema. 40 mg IV lasix was
   given with 200cc UOP. Her saturation improved on hi flow venti mask
   saturating 95%.
   A CVL was placed but coiled into the SC.
   Because of her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis, low grade
   fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for further
   care.
   24 Hour Events:
   Vanco and aztreonam started.  CXR shows patchy opaicities- about the
   same as [**4-11**].
   Witnessed aspiration event during AM med administration.
   In the MICU she received lasix 60 IV with 500 cc u/o.
   She did not tolerate BIPAP
   After diuresis her oxygen requirement declined to 60% but while on
   rounds she became solmnolent and then unresponsive and hypoxemic
   shortly after removal of her right IJ CVL that was malpositioned.  Her
   lung exam was notable for bilateral breath sounds, diffuse expiratory
   wheeze.
   She was then emergently intubated.  Post intubation ABG notable for
   PO2=170 on 100% FIO2.  Solumedrol 125 IV given x 1 but not continued
   after vent mechanics revealed Ppeak=27, Pplat=25
   Placed on LTV ventilatory strategy.
   OGT placed with copious feculent material aspirated (airway clear on
   intubation per anesthesia).

She has had multiple abdominal surgeries, including sigmoid resection for large bowel obstruction with anastomotic leak, multiple episodes of intra-abdominal abscesses requiring surgical correction, diverticulitis with colovesicular fistula, and partial colonic resection with ileostomy. She also had ileostomy reversal and worsening diarrhea since then.

The patient has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for long hospital stays with extensive workups that have been negative so far. Most recently, she was admitted for worsening dyspnea and oxygen requirement. She was transferred to another hospital for a second opinion regarding her gastrointestinal symptoms. Upon arrival at the new hospital, she required supplemental oxygen and her ABG showed a paO2 of 54 with significant pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She was given 40 mg IV lasix with 200cc UOP, and her saturation improved on high-flow venti mask, saturating 95%.

A central venous line (CVL) was placed but coiled into the subclavian vein. Due to her hypoxia from CHF and likely pneumonia (leukocytosis, low-grade fever, sput"

   80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries
   tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea. She had diverticulitis
   with colovesicular fistula in [**2169**] that required partial colonic
   resection and an ileostomy. In [**2170-12-4**], she had the ileostomy reversed
   and since then, she has had worsening of her diarrhea. In fact, since
   [**Month (only) **], she has been admitted to OSH 5 times for long hospital stays with
   extensive work up that has been negative so far. Most recently, she was
   admitted to OSH [**3-27**] where workup again has been negative. She has been
   getting IVF; lasix held. The family requested a transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] this
   morning for a 2nd opinion at a [**Hospital 7454**] care center. Of note this
   morning, she had flash pulm edema and was given 40mg IV lasix with
   [**2162**]+cc urine output.
   .
   She was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on supplemental oxygen. On arrival to the
   floor, she required 6LNC and was saturating 88%. ABG showed paO2 of 54.
   CXR was consistent with significant pulm edema. 40 mg IV lasix was
   given with 200cc UOP. Her saturation improved on hi flow venti mask
   saturating 95%. Of note, her central line is not at the proper place in
   the Xray. Because of her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for
   further care.
   .
   At the OSH, she was started on sucrulfate for gastritis, reglan for
   mild gastroparesis and nortyptilline. She was also kept on immodium
   standing at 4mg [**Hospital1 7**] and psyllium. Her surgeons felt that she had a
   ""short colon"". She underwent colonscopy and EGD w/o diagnosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   Got Lasix  60 iv total overnight with appx 500cc.
   BIPAP started [**4-10**] but patient did not tolerate.  Now on 60% Hi-flow.
   Right IJ malpositioned.
   Vanco and aztreonam started.  CXR shows patchy opaicities- about the
   same as [**4-11**].
   Witnessed aspiration event during AM med administration.

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, patient is 80 yo female with ILD, COPD and now found with
   severe hypoxemia in the setting of diffuse evidence of pulmonary
   infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  She has had significant
   volume load although patient did have severe acute decompensation over
   past hours
this may be hydrostatic edema which would be supported by
   small bilateral effusions but patient with warm extremities and unclear
   underlying cardiac function.  She has had Lasix with minimal
   improvement.  Alternative sources are certainly aspiration with diffuse
   pneumonitis.  In addition
GI or alternative source for sepsis is
   certainly possible with evolution of diffuse Acute Lung Injury.
   Finally, viral pneumonia or atypical bacterial pneumonia is possible.
   PULM: Oxygen, defer on imaging.  IF she stabilizes obtain chest CT.
   Nebs for COPD.  Likely is aspirating.
   CV: hemodynamically stable. TBB even.  Obtain TTE.  Pull malpositioned

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was found with severe hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient has had significant volume overload and experienced severe acute decompensation over the past few hours. There are a few potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is clearly hypoxemic, and respiratory failure is already present. The plan is to continue with supplemental oxygen, monitor for improvement, and consider intubation if necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient may have an alternative source of sepsis, possibly from the gastrointestinal tract or aspiration. This could lead to the development of septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the evolution of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and the presence of hypoxemia, the patient is at risk for developing ALI/ARDS.

4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has warm extremities, but her underlying cardiac function is unclear. Cardiac dysfunction could contribute to the pulmonary edema and may require further investigation and management.

5. Legionella pneumonia: Legionella infection is a possibility and should be ruled out with appropriate testing.

6. Atypical bacterial pneumonia: Another possible cause of the pulmonary infiltrates is atypical bacterial pneumonia.

   80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries
   tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea. She had diverticulitis
   with colovesicular fistula in [**2169**] that required partial colonic
   resection and an ileostomy. In [**2170-12-4**], she had the ileostomy reversed
   and since then, she has had worsening of her diarrhea. In fact, since
   [**Month (only) **], she has been admitted to OSH 5 times for long hospital stays with
   extensive work up that has been negative so far. Most recently, she was
   admitted to OSH [**3-27**] where workup again has been negative. She has been
   getting IVF; lasix held. The family requested a transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] this
   morning for a 2nd opinion at a [**Hospital 7454**] care center. Of note this
   morning, she had flash pulm edema and was given 40mg IV lasix with
   [**2162**]+cc urine output.
   .
   She was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on supplemental oxygen. On arrival to the
   floor, she required 6LNC and was saturating 88%. ABG showed paO2 of 54.
   CXR was consistent with significant pulm edema. 40 mg IV lasix was
   given with 200cc UOP. Her saturation improved on hi flow venti mask
   saturating 95%. Of note, her central line is not at the proper place in
   the Xray. Because of her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for
   further care.

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, patient is 80 yo female with ILD, COPD and now found with
   severe hypoxemia in the setting of diffuse evidence of pulmonary
   infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  She has had significant
   volume load although patient did have severe acute decompensation over
   past hours
this may be hydrostatic edema which would be supported by
   small bilateral effusions but patient with warm extremities and unclear
   underlying cardiac function.  She has had Lasix with minimal
   improvement.  Alternative sources are certainly aspiration with diffuse
   pneumonitis.  In addition
GI or alternative source for sepsis is
   certainly possible with evolution of diffuse Acute Lung Injury.
   Finally, viral pneumonia or atypical bacterial pneumonia is possible.
   Respiratory Failure
Clearly hypoxemic
   -Will continue with supplemental oxygen
   -Vanco/Aztreonam to continue
   -Lasix given and look for response over time
   -Will check Legionella
   -ACE-I for afterload reduction
   -Intubation discussed and may well be required and patient is amenable
   if required

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening diarrhea and flash pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone extensive workups that have been negative. She requires supplemental oxygen and has been on non-invasive ventilation since April 11th. A multi-lumen line was inserted on April 12th. The patient's allergies include latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently experiencing severe hypoxemia with diffuse evidence of pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. She has had significant volume overload and acute decompensation. The possible causes of her condition include hydrostatic edema, aspiration with diffuse pneumonitis, gastrointestinal or alternative source for sepsis, viral pneumonia, or atypical bacterial pneumonia. The patient is being managed with supplemental oxygen, Lasix, vancomycin/aztreonam, and consideration for intubation if necessary. An ACE inhibitor may be given for afterload reduction, and Legionella testing will be conducted."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient's medical history indicates a transfer from OSH for a second opinion on diarrhea, which is now admitted to the MICU.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a PaO2 of 54 on NC and is in distress. She meets criteria for ARDS, and her CXR shows central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. The hypoxia and respiratory distress appear to be an acute change. The patient also has mild bibasilar crackles on exam on admission but now has diffuse crackles all the way up the lung. An elevated BNP suggests acute pulmonary edema. However, diffuse infiltrates can also occur with ARDS, viral PNA, or atypical PNA; aspiration is also possible. She has an elevated WBC and edema may be hiding infiltrates. She has no risk factors for ARDS - no sepsis, no pancreatitis, no transfusion. It is unlikely that she would have developed viral PNA while at OSH. The patient's EKG shows IVCD, non-specific T-wave changes, and small ST depressions in V5/V"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was transferred from another hospital for a second opinion on her diarrhea and is now admitted to the MICU for hypoxia. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and has a PaO2 of 54 on NC. Her CXR shows central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She has diffuse crackles throughout her lungs and an elevated BNP, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. Other possible causes of diffuse infiltrates include ARDS, viral or atypical pneumonia, and aspiration. She has no risk factors for ARDS, and viral PNA is unlikely to have developed while at OSH. The patient denies chest pain but could still have had an MI. She is not hypertensive, and her EKG shows IVCD, non-specific T wave changes, and small ST depressions in V5/V6. She has received lasix 40mg IV, and her fluid status is being monitored. Her allergies include morphine, demerol, and isosorbide.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low PaO2 indicates severe oxygen deprivation, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, indicating delirium or"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has a chief complaint of breathing slightly better. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 137/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, crackles at the left lower lung base, high-pitched end expiratory wheezing, and right-sided heart sounds. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient also has elevated lactate acid levels and a slightly low calcium level. Imaging shows slightly improved bilateral infiltrates from the previous night's CXR. 

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxemia, delirium/confusion, and other medical conditions such as CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and abdominal surgeries. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further hypoxemia, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), gastrointestinal issues such as gastrointestinal bleeding or diarrhea, cardiac complications related to the patient's history of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and is now intubated due to a hypoxic event. The patient has been experiencing difficulty breathing, desaturation, and unresponsiveness. She also has leukocytosis with 18.8 WBC count, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and delirium/confusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on CXR suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. She is currently on ARDSnet ventilation protocol to wean FiO2 and PEEP.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's recent hospitalization and aspiration event increase the risk of HAP. Empiric coverage with d3 Vanc and d3 aztreonam has been started.

3. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's recent aspiration event may have led to aspiration pneumonitis. Flagyl has been given for aspiration pneumonia.

4. Delirium/confusion: The patient is showing signs of delirium/confusion, which can be caused by multiple factors such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication effects.

5. Short gut syndrome: The patient's extensive workup for diarrhea has revealed the possibility of short gut syndrome. This"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated on ARDSnet ventilation. She has a recent history of acute hypoxic events, aspiration, and delirium. The patient's allergies include latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin. She has been receiving multiple medications including propofol, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin, diltiazem, and ipratropium/albuterol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with 1+ GPCs in her sputum, suggesting a possible infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
3. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing episodes of delirium, which can be a complication of severe illness, medications, or ICU environment. Close monitoring and management of sed"

She also had an episode of shortness of breath and subsequent intubation.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and 1+ GPCs in the sputum indicates a potential respiratory infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the fact that she is intubated, there is an increased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which has not been fully evaluated yet. Microscopic colitis is being considered, and biopsies are pending."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-lumen insertion, invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and various other medical interventions. The patient has a history of allergies to latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamine (diphenhydramine Hcl), quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids (morphine), cortisone, iodine, levaquin (levofloxacin), and more. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were aztreonam, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently on propofol infusion, diltiazem, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (protonix). Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/44 mmHg to 129/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, HCO3- of 74 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation of 148. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 358 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of <0.01. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and delirium/confusion. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and CHF. She was intubated for hypoxemic arrest and is currently meeting criteria for ARDS. The patient also has a history of witnessed aspiration and known CHF. She is being treated in the ICU for aspiration pneumonia and complex GI issues.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate of 83 bpm with a range of 78-120 bpm, blood pressure of 98/48 mmHg with a range of 63-129/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute with a range of 14-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, and elevated BNP level of 1100. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention to 10cm, no liver abnormalities, crackles at the left lower lung base, and no wheezing. The patient's abdomen is soft"

   80 yo female history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD,
   witnessed aspiration, known CHF aspiration pneumonia is likely the
   driving process for the current compensation.  Her complex GI issues
   also will require evaluation and were the original reason for transfer
   from OSH.
   Respiratory failure: underlying ILD/ COPD ( ? ) but now with element of
   acute CHF vs aspiration PNA vs [**Doctor Last Name 11**] from GI source
   -Suspect acute aspiration will send sputum if produced.
   - will obtain old CT scans and x-rays for review but proceed to Chest
   CT today here
   - consider bronch/ BAL pending review of CT scans
   -Continue nebs, ? need for steroids
   -Sputum 1+ GPC
   CV:
   -F/U TTE
   -On Plavix
   -Hold enaliprate and norvasc and continue Dilt
   -Will give small bolus for for CVP and urine output, She is fluid
   sensitive and this will help with HR control ( afib)
   GI:
   -Will review OSH studies regarding workup of chronic diarrhea
   -Will rescan abdomen
   -Will follow up biopsies from OS
   -GI consult for chronic diarrhea
   Heme
   -Elevated INR suspect related to chronic diarrhea and malabsorption

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and known CHF. She was intubated for hypoxemic arrest and is currently meeting criteria for ARDS. The patient's transfer from OSH is for a second opinion on diarrhea following colectomies for diverticulitis. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require attention.

1. Respiratory: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has shown signs of acute aspiration. Further evaluation is needed, including obtaining sputum if produced, old CT scans and x-rays, and a non-contrast chest scan to consider bronchoscopic evaluation. Nebulizers should be continued.

2. Cardiovascular: A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is required. The patient is on Plavix, and enalapril and norvasc should be held while continuing diltiazem. A small bolus for CVP and urine output should be given.

3. Gastrointestinal: Chronic diarrhea needs to be evaluated by reviewing OSH studies regarding the workup of chronic diarrhea, rescan the abdomen, follow up biopsies from OS, and consult a GI specialist for chronic diarrhea.

4. Hematology: Elevated INR is suspected to be related to chronic diarrhea and malabsorption. Further evaluation is necessary.

5. Endocrine: Continue synthroid as per the end"

   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. This
   morning, she had a witnessed aspiration yesterday and then had a
   hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became unresponsive
   requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral
   infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on diltiazem. She also has leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and diarrhea. The patient's recent events include a witnessed aspiration, hypoxic event, and intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was ventilated with ARDSnet protocol.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is receiving empiric coverage with d3 Vanc and d3 aztreonam for HAP, as well as flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of extensive workup without diagnosis for her diarrhea. Possible leading diagnoses include short gut (""short colon""), microscopic colitis, VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome, fat malabsorption, and pancreatic insufficiency.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which may require close monitoring and management.

   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. This
   morning, she had a witnessed aspiration yesterday and then had a
   hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became unresponsive
   requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral
   infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and diagnosed with respiratory failure. She also has diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, electrolyte & fluid disorder, leukocytosis, and delirium/confusion. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on ventilatory support due to a hypoxic event. She required emergent intubation after experiencing aspiration and subsequent hypoxia. The patient's P/F ratio was 177, and her chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates, indicating the possibility of pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She is being ventilated using the ARDSnet protocol with tidal volumes.

The patient is receiving empiric coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with d3 Vanc and d3 aztreonam, as well as flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. An echocardiogram was ordered today to evaluate her ejection fraction. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and her sputum culture showed 1+ GPCs. Further investigations, including stool culture, UCx, and sputum culture, are pending.

The patient's extensive workup for diarrhea remains inconclusive, with possible diagnoses including short gut, microscopic colitis, VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome, and fat malabsorption. Biopsies"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is now in the ICU. The patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure, diarrhea, and atrial fibrillation.

From the assessment and plan section, the following medical complications can potentially arise:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxia with central patchy infiltrates on CXR, indicating pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She had a witnessed aspiration event, leading to acute hypoxia and unresponsiveness requiring emergent intubation. The patient is currently ventilated with ARDSnet protocol.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient had new leukocytosis yesterday, but it is trending down. Sputum culture shows 1+ GPCs. Further investigations such as stool culture, UCx, and sputum culture are pending.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). Fluid balance shows positive net fluid input with significant output through various routes.

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which is common in critically ill patients.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries
   tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who is now admitted to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had
   a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely
   desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F
   ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated
   with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent
   with infection vs. ARDS.
   - Vent: continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP using ardsnet tidal volumes
   tolerating PaO2 70-80; will ensure tidal volumes are appropriate for
   height/weight and decrease
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]), aztreonam (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for empriric
   coverage of HAP;
   - Continue flagyl ((Day 1 = [**4-12**]) for aspiration pna
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q4hrs PRN
   - Bronchoscopy planned for [**4-13**]
   - Check influenza DFA
   - Acquire OSH CXR / CT chest imaging
   # Sepsis: She had new leukocytosis yesterday, but today is trending
   down.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with staph aureus.  Legionella antigen
   negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative
   - Blood culture pending, although lower yield as will have already
   received abx
   - On flagyl which will empirically cover c.diff
   - PNA treatment as above
   - IVF boluses PRN
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: not on home O2.
   - Cont Advair and Singulair
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although I beleive short colon
   does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Likewise labs for VIPoma, carcinoid syndrom and fat malabsorbtion
   are pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.
   - Continue Metamucil, nortriptyline
   - d/c immodium until stool cx neg
   - Repeat C.diff, O/P, cryto/isosporidium
   - Attempt to obtain stool na and K for stool osms -> stool currently
   not liquiid enough
   - f/u VIP, 5HIAA, fecal fat from OSH
   - Colon biopsy on [**3-12**] at OSH still pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Check TTG
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Cont PP IV, avoid PO PPI
   - d/c sucrulfate
   # CAD: not on ASA? will need to ask pt when off BiPap
   - Coninue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Consider addition of bblocker
   - Consider systemic anticoagulation
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH ahd Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and later intubated due to a hypoxic event. She has a witnessed aspiration and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is currently being ventilated using ARDSnet protocol. Her condition is consistent with infection versus ARDS. The patient also presents with diarrhea, which has been extensively investigated without diagnosis. Potential leading diagnosis includes short gut syndrome, microscopic colitis, VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome, fat malabsorption, and pancreatic insufficiency. The patient's allergies include latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin. She is currently on various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, ipratropium, albuterol, and flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure due to hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of central patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, elevated white blood cell count, and positive sputum culture for Staphylococcus aureus suggest a possible infection.
3. ARDS (Acute"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint: Diarrhea and subsequent
   HPI:  80 yo female presents with Hypoxemia in the setting of history of
   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis.
   24 Hour Events:
   CT diffuse ground glass

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and CHF. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, acute CHF, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has a history of chronic diarrhea and is undergoing evaluation for that as well. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia. Her blood work indicates anemia and elevated white blood cell count. The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and diffuse crackles on physical examination suggest aspiration pneumonia. This is a serious infection that occurs when foreign material enters the lungs through inhalation. It can lead to sepsis and respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS may be secondary to aspiration pneumonia or acute CHF. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Acute Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF and symptoms of hypoxemia, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest acute heart failure. CHF occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs"

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin. The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 120/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a ventilator. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 27 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 190 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased TV (tidal volume) due to ARDSnet. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on metoprolol for rate control. The patient also has multiple allergies, including latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 106 bpm with an irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 115/50 mmHg to 140/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 1,453 mL and output of 1,240 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood products and urine output are also recorded. The patient's respiratory support includes a Vt set at 330 mL, RR set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and ABG results indicating a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.0 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 103 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L, and elevated lactate levels at 9.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and ICU care. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, and lines have been placed for arterial blood gas monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be necessary.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, as indicated in the assessment and plan section. This could be due to the underlying illness, medications, or other factors. It is important to address this issue promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's labs indicate hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. These electrolyte imbalances can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance are crucial.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is currently present. This condition increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic complications.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an inflammatory response or infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be necessary to prevent the progression of infection.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are required.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who is
   now admitted to MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had
   a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely
   desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F
   ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated
   with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent
   with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL
   sent.
   - Ventilator: continue to wean PEEP using ardsnet tidal volumes
   tolerating PaO2 70-80; will ensure tidal volumes are appropriate for
   height/weight and decrease
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in sputum
   - Stop aztreonam and flagyl ([**4-15**])
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q4hrs PRN
   # Sepsis: Trending down (as of [**4-15**]).  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with
   staph aureus.  Legionella antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff
   included) negative
   - Blood culture pending, although lower yield as will have already
   received abx
   - On flagyl which will empirically cover c.diff
   - Will send 2^nd c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - PNA treatment as above
   - IVF boluses PRN
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Cont Advair and Singulair
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although I beleive short colon
   does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - Attempt to obtain stool Na and K for stool osm ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Check TTG ([**4-14**])
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV, avoid PO PPI
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Consider systemic anticoagulation (unclear reason why not on)
   - Continue plavix
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH ahd Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted for worsening hypoxia and central patchy infiltrates on CXR, which could represent pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She had a witnessed aspiration and then experienced a hypoxic event, resulting in emergent intubation due to unresponsiveness. She was ventilated with ARDSnet protocol and has been in the MICU for hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on CXR indicate the possibility of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), which can lead to severe respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, negative urine analysis, but positive sputum culture for MRSA. Blood cultures are pending, but she is already receiving antibiotics empirically.
3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has diarrhea, for which extensive workup has been done without diagnosis. Possible causes include short gut syndrome, infections, microscopic colitis, VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome, fat malabsorption, and pancreatic insufficiency. Biopsies are pending, and further tests are needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with diltiazem. She is also at risk for"

   now admitted to MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had
   a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely
   desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F
   ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated
   with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent
   with infection vs. ARDS.
   - Vent: continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP using ardsnet tidal volumes
   tolerating PaO2 70-80; will ensure tidal volumes are appropriate for
   height/weight and decrease
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]), aztreonam (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for empriric
   coverage of HAP;
   - Continue flagyl ((Day 1 = [**4-12**]) for aspiration pna
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q4hrs PRN
   - Bronchoscopy planned for [**4-13**]
   - Check influenza DFA
   - Acquire OSH CXR / CT chest imaging
   # Sepsis: She had new leukocytosis yesterday, but today is trending
   down.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with staph aureus.  Legionella antigen
   negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative
   - Blood culture pending, although lower yield as will have already
   received abx
   - On flagyl which will empirically cover c.diff
   - PNA treatment as above
   - IVF boluses PRN
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: not on home O2.
   - Cont Advair and Singulair
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although I beleive short colon
   does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Likewise labs for VIPoma, carcinoid syndrom and fat malabsorbtion
   are pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.
   - Continue Metamucil, nortriptyline
   - d/c immodium until stool cx neg
   - Repeat C.diff, O/P, cryto/isosporidium
   - Attempt to obtain stool na and K for stool osms -> stool currently
   not liquiid enough
   - f/u VIP, 5HIAA, fecal fat from OSH
   - Colon biopsy on [**3-12**] at OSH still pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Check TTG
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Cont PP IV, avoid PO PPI
   - d/c sucrulfate
   # CAD: not on ASA? will need to ask pt when off BiPap
   - Coninue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Consider addition of bblocker
   - Consider systemic anticoagulation
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH ahd Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted for worsening hypoxia and central patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray. She had a witnessed aspiration and then experienced a hypoxic event, resulting in emergent intubation. The patient is currently in the MICU for hypoxia and has been ventilated using the ARDSnet protocol. She has a preserved EF on echo and CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary issue is hypoxia, which has led to respiratory failure. She requires continuous monitoring of oxygen levels and appropriate ventilation support.
2. Infection: The patient has positive MRSA screens in her sputum on [4-12] and [4-13], indicating a possible MRSA infection. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and aztreonam for empirical coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Further cultures and sensitivity testing are pending.
3. Sepsis: The patient had new leukocytosis yesterday but is now trending down. Her urine analysis/culture is negative, and she is on flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. Blood cultures are pending, and she may have already received antibiotics, which could affect the results.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has had extensive workup without a diagnosis"

   Chief Complaint: Diarrhea and subsequent
   HPI:  80 yo female presents with Hypoxemia in the setting of history of
   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo female history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD,
   witnessed aspiration, known CHF aspiration pneumonia is likely the
   driving process for the current decompensation.  Her complex GI issues
   also will require evaluation and were the original reason for transfer
   from OSH.
   Respiratory failure: underlying ILD/ COPD ( ? ) but now with element of
   acute CHF vs aspiration PNA vs [**Doctor Last Name 11**] from GI source
   -Suspect acute aspiration will follow sputum currently growing staph.
   - will obtain old CT scans and x-rays for review but proceed to Chest
   CT today here
   - Will bronch/ BAL today in RLL
   -Will calculate ARDS requirements and will decrease volumes to maintain
   plateu less than 30
   CV:
   -On Plavix
   -Hold enaliprate and norvasc and continue Dilt may have to reduce dose
   if hypotensive
   -Responded to
   GI:-Not an active issue as not getting feed, will follow nutrition recs
   -Will review OSH studies regarding workup of chronic diarrhea
   -Will review OSH records
   -GI consult for chronic diarrhea
   If any decompensation on account of GI issues, will consult surgery.
   Heme
   -Mild iron deficiancy anemia and mixed anemia chronic disease
   -Elevated INR improved
   ENDO:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient underwent an urgent bronchoscopy due to severe hypoxemia and was intubated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/56 to 102/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may be due to various factors, including sedatives, underlying medical conditions, or ICU psychosis.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's lab results indicate imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and blood glucose levels, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
5. Hypot"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and known congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently intubated and meeting criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was transferred from another hospital for a second opinion regarding diarrhea, likely related to past colectomies for diverticulitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/56 to 140/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and she has a CVP of 5 mmHg. The patient has received various medications, including metoprolol, heparin sodium, propofol, and others.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on ARDS net ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 330 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 20.0"

   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Unable to be extubated and did not tolerate PS
   trial yesterday although oxygen requirements decreasing.  Picture most
   consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Patient was admitted with
   worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could
   represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is
   not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event
   where she acutely desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent
   intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she
   was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT
   chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**])
   appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   - Trial of PSV in afternoon w/ hope for extubation today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid d6 out of 8 today,

   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is being treated with vancomycin for MRSA in the BAL fluid. She also has sepsis, possibly from a pulmonary source, and is being treated accordingly. The patient's diarrhea remains undiagnosed despite extensive workup, including ruling out infections and considering microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and short colon. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and receiving medications for her other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to be extubated and did not tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday. This indicates a risk of continued respiratory failure and the need for ongoing mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin, which needs to be closely monitored and treated aggressively to prevent further complications.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea remains unexplained despite extensive workup. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea. The stool culture has confirmed Clostridium difficile (C-diff) infection. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and aztreonam, with a plan to obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to guide further antibiotic therapy. Lasix has been initiated to manage fluid overload. The patient's PEEP has been decreased to 8, and ABG results show a pH of 7.47, indicating respiratory alkalosis. The patient's respiratory rate has been reduced to 18 breaths per minute. The patient underwent a pressure support trial but experienced significant overbreathing, so they were placed back on assist-control ventilation (AC).

The patient has multiple known allergies, including latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were metronidazole on [**2172-4-15**] at 08:00 AM, vancomycin on [**2172-4-16**] at 12:00 AM, and aztreonam on [**2172-4-16**] at 04:00 AM.

The patient is receiving propofol at a rate of 15 mcg/kg"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who is
   now admitted to MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had
   a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely
   desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F
   ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated
   with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent
   with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL
   sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis.
   Continue further diuresis today goal -1L. Trial of PSV in afternoon.
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in sputum d6 today
   - Stop aztreonam
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q4hrs PRN
   # Sepsis: Trending down (as of [**4-15**]).  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with
   MRSA.  Legionella antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff
   included) negative
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Cont Advair and Singulair
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although I beleive short colon
   does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV, avoid PO PPI
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Consider systemic anticoagulation (unclear reason why not on)
   - Continue plavix
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH ahd Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. The patient was admitted for worsening hypoxia and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She experienced a witnessed aspiration and subsequently had a hypoxic event requiring emergent intubation. The patient is currently in the MICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure.

The patient's recent medical history includes an episode of sepsis, which is trending down. She also has a history of COPD and possible ILD, although she is not on home oxygen. Other conditions include gastritis/GERD, atrial fibrillation (afib), hypothyroidism, and diarrhea of unknown etiology. The patient has undergone extensive workup for the diarrhea, including stool cultures, microscopic colitis biopsy, gastrin levels, 5HIAA levels, VIP levels, and TTG levels. The stool osm gap suggests a secretory diarrhea. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and propofol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 118/51 mm"

   now admitted to MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could represent pulmonary
   edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had
   a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely
   desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F
   ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated
   with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent
   with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL
   sent.
   - Ventilator: can drop down RR, PSV trial today

   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q4hrs PRN
   # Sepsis: Trending down (as of [**4-15**]).  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with
   MRSA.  Legionella antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff

   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Cont Advair and Singulair
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although I beleive short colon
   does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and later intubated due to a hypoxic event. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and is being treated with antibiotics for MRSA in her sputum. Other ongoing assessments and plans include respiratory failure, diarrhea, gastritis/GERD, CAD, atrial fibrillation (afib), and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, there is a potential risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to persistent or worsening respiratory failure.
2. Diarrhea: Despite extensive workup, the cause of the patient's diarrhea remains undiagnosed. There is a risk of continued fluid and electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and malnutrition if the diarrhea persists.
3. Infections: The patient has already had multiple infections, including pneumonia and sepsis. There is a risk of developing new infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Cardiac Conditions: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, and"

   Chief Complaint: Diarrhea and subsequent
   HPI:  80 yo female presents with Hypoxemia in the setting of history of
   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and known CHF. She was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia and is currently meeting criteria for ARDS. The patient also has complex GI issues, which were the original reason for transfer from OSH.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and CHF puts her at risk for recurrent aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia. The current respiratory failure is suspected to be caused by aspiration pneumonia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is meeting criteria for ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to decreased oxygenation and respiratory distress.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection acquired during mechanical ventilation.
4. Chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has mild iron deficiency anemia, which may contribute to fatigue and weakness.
6. Mixed anemia: The patient also has mixed anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or another underlying cause.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated on several occasions, indicating potential difficulty in maintaining glycemic control.
8. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows positive values, indicating fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function.
9. Thromboembolic events: As an immobilized patient, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and a comprehensive evaluation by healthcare professionals is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and known CHF. She presented with hypoxemia and witnessed aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS. She was transferred from OSH for a second opinion on diarrhea, which is a complication from past colectomies for diverticulitis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/51 to 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a CVP of 4 mmHg and is receiving fluids, with a total input of 1,755 mL and output of 1,055 mL. Her urine output is 1,045 mL, and she has had some NG output. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set Vt of 330 mL, RR of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 147. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290, and Ve of 11.7 L/min. Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated, sedated, and responds appropriately. She has a CTA anteriorly and edema in her extremities. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count ranging from 14.4 to 17.3 thousand/mm3, Hct of 29.3-32.0%, Plt of 287-376 thousand/mm3, Cr of 0.5-0.9 mg/dL, TCO2 of 22-28 mmol/L, and Glucose of 95-174 mg/dL. Other lab values include a PT/PTT/INR of 14.9/36.0/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 40/<0.01/<0.01, ALT/AST of 9-23 U/L, Alk Phos/T Bili of 81/1.1, and LDH of 331 IU/L. Stool lytes gap is 66, and Micro-BAL grew MRSA. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and she also has complex GI issues that require evaluation. The plan includes increasing vancomycin to [**Hospital1 **], discontinuing aztreonam, obtaining old CT scans and x-rays for review, weaning vent by decreasing PEEP and diuresis, transitioning to Precide"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and CHF. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a current SpO2 of 98%. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 118/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.7°C. The patient has a history of diarrhea and is currently receiving IV fluids.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is suspected to be caused by aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 330 mL. The PEEP is set at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and plateau pressure at 28 cmH2O.

2. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, which may be related to her underlying gastrointestinal issues. Stool cultures are pending to determine the cause of the diarrhea.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a known history of aspiration, and it is likely contributing to her current decompensation. She has an active infection with MRSA in her sputum culture.

   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo female history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD,
   witnessed aspiration, known CHF aspiration pneumonia is likely the
   driving process for the current decompensation.  Her complex GI issues
   also will require evaluation and were the original reason for transfer
   from OSH.
   Respiratory failure: underlying ILD/ COPD ( ? ) but now with element of
   acute CHF vs aspiration PNA vs [**Doctor Last Name 11**] from GI source
   -Suspect acute aspiration will follow sputum currently growing staph.
   - will obtain old CT scans and x-rays for review but proceed to Chest
   CT today here
   - F/u bronch/ BAL results
   -Check vanc level
   -Will d

   -Will continue to wean vent by decreasing PEEP after diuresis
   CV:
   -On Plavix
   -Hold enaliprate and norvasc and continue Dilt and metoprolol
   -Goal negative 1L
   GI:-Not an active issue as not getting feed, will follow nutrition recs
   -Will review OSH studies regarding workup of chronic diarrhea
   -Will review OSH records
   -GI consult for chronic diarrhea continue metamucil
   -If any decompensation on account of GI issues, will consult surgery.
   -TTG pending
   Heme
   -Mild iron deficiancy anemia and mixed anemia chronic disease
   -Elevated INR improved
   ENDO:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and CHF. She is currently intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS. The patient's chief complaint is diarrhea, and she has been experiencing respiratory failure with an underlying ILD/COPD. She also has a known history of aspiration pneumonia and has recently been admitted to the ICU for a second opinion regarding her diarrhea, which is believed to be from past colectomies for diverticulitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/51 to 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory system compliance of 147, peak inspiratory pressure of 29 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 28 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her liver function tests and renal function tests are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated, sedated, and opens her eyes. She has inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, irregular"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Not able to wean on
   vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions. Sputum has grown MRSA.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin limiting resolution of
   the MRSA infection.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Increase PEEP back to 10 today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid, check vanco trough
   this AM
   - Repeat sputum today, broaden if increasing fever curve or evidence of
   other pathogens from sputum
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative
   - Obtain films from OSH to get a better sense of preexisting pulmonary
   disease
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl yesterday. Follow BP today. Will
   change to propofol today.
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: With diarrhea ?how much absorbing feeds. Check albumin,
   consider TPN if lower/stable and stop TFs.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and requires intubation due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, hypotension, diarrhea, anemia, gastritis/GERD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and the need for prolonged intubation or tracheostomy.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, possibly due to a pulmonary source. Close monitoring for fever, hypotension, and signs of organ dysfunction is necessary. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover potential pathogens, including MRSA.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely due to the use of precedex and fentanyl. Blood pressure should be closely monitored, and vasopressor support may be required.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea despite extensive workup. The cause remains undiagnosed, with possibilities including microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, or short gut syndrome. Nutritional support and further investigation are needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Unable to be extubated and did not tolerate PS
   trial yesterday although oxygen requirements decreasing.  Picture most
   consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Patient was admitted with
   worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could
   represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is
   not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event
   where she acutely desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent
   intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she
   was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT
   chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**])
   appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   - Trial of PSV in afternoon w/ hope for extubation today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid d6 out of 8 today,
   will increase to 1g q12
   - Stop aztreonam (D1 = [**4-12**])
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Lasix 20 mg IV w/ goal 1 L negative as still + for LOS
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV, avoid PO PPI
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient's main concerns include hypoxia, respiratory failure, sepsis, diarrhea, anemia, gastritis/GERD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure or pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to be extubated and tolerate a pressure support trial suggests ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's normotensive state and negative urine analysis make a pulmonary source of sepsis likely. Treatment for MRSA should be continued, and reculture if febrile.
4. Diarrhea: Despite extensive workup, the cause of the patient's diarrhea remains undiagnosed. Short gut syndrome, infections, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and other causes should be considered.
5. Anemia: The unclear etiology of anemia warrants further investigation. Iron studies indicate mild iron deficiency, and not guaiac positive.
6. Gastritis/GERD: The patient's gastritis/GERD should be managed with continued PPI IV and avoiding PO PPI.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: Unable to be extubated and did not tolerate PS
   trial yesterday although oxygen requirements decreasing.  Picture most
   consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Patient was admitted with
   worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy infiltrates that could
   represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD. Patient has hx ILD but is
   not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration and then had a hypoxic event
   where she acutely desated and became unresponsive requiring emergent
   intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with bilateral infiltrates and she
   was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.  Echo with preserved EF.  CT
   chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**])
   appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   - Trial of PSV in afternoon w/ hope for extubation today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid d6 out of 8 today,
   will increase to 1g q12
   - Stop aztreonam (D1 = [**4-12**])
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Lasix 20 mg IV w/ goal 1 L negative as still + for LOS
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV, avoid PO PPI
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and required intubation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and sepsis, possibly due to a pulmonary source. The patient also has chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology and anemia of unclear origin. She has a history of gastritis/GERD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and central patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate the possibility of respiratory failure due to pneumonia or pulmonary edema. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator overbreathing, leading to respiratory alkalosis. Decreasing PEEP to 5 and considering a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) have been planned.
2. Sepsis: The patient's previous normotension and off pressors indicate a potential resolution of septic shock. However, she remains at risk for recurrent sepsis due to her underlying PNA and positive sputum culture for MRSA. Continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's extensive workup has not identified a specific cause for her chronic diarrhea. Microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and other gastrointestinal disorders should be considered."

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint: Diarrhea , respiratory failure
   HPI:  80 yo female presents with Hypoxemia in the setting of history of
   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis
   24 hr events:
   Was doing well on higher dose of presidex then became hypotensive,
   increased secretions and continue to be uncomfortable

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD, and chronic heart failure. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which is believed to be related to past colectomies for diverticulitis. She also has a known allergy to latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, levaquin, and more.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/44 mmHg to 141/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 115. Her blood gases show pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 203, and oxygen consumption of 13.9 L/min.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated,"

   underlying stage IV sarcoidosis, COPD baseline no on O2, witnessed
   aspiration, known CHF- now intubated and meeting criteria for ARDS.
   Given OGT output, aspiration pneumonia is likely the driving process
   for the current compensation.  Her tranfer from OSH is for 2nd opinion
   of diarrhea from past colectomies for diverticulitis

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Not able to wean on
   vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions. Sputum has grown MRSA.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin limiting resolution of
   the MRSA infection.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Increase PEEP back to 10 today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid, check vanco trough
   this AM
   - Repeat sputum today, broaden if increasing fever curve or evidence of
   other pathogens from sputum
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative
   - Obtain films from OSH to get a better sense of preexisting pulmonary
   disease
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl yesterday. Follow BP today. Will
   change to propofol today.
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: With diarrhea ?how much absorbing feeds. Check albumin,
   consider TPN if lower/stable and stop TFs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a medical history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated due to ARDS. She has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin, which is limiting the resolution of the infection. Her respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set Vt of 330 mL, RR of 18, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 30 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary concern is her worsening hypoxia, leading to ARDS. It is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and continue treatment for MRSA pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's current management includes elevating the head of the bed, performing mouth care, and implementing daily wake-up trials to assess readiness to extubate.
3. Sepsis: The patient may be at risk for sepsis due to the MRSA infection and other potential sources of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on precedex for sedation, but it was switched to propofol due to difficulty extubating. The patient's allergies, medications, and infusions are documented.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 111 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 123/55 mmHg to 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a set tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 330, and oxygen consumption of 11.3 L/min.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 174 mg/dL, normal sodium level of 137 mEq/L, slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L, low albumin level of 2.2 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to intubation, but there are no signs of peripheral vascular abnormalities, skin abnormalities, or neurologic abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and delirium/confusion. The patient is receiving nutritional support through Vivonex at a rate of 50 mL/hour and has multiple lines including an arterial line and a PICC line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening hypoxemia, infection, or fluid imbalance."

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Not able to wean on
   vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions. Sputum has grown MRSA.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin limiting resolution of
   the MRSA infection.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Increase PEEP back to 10 today
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid, check vanco trough
   this AM
   - Repeat sputum today, broaden if increasing fever curve or evidence of
   other pathogens from sputum
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative
   - Obtain films from OSH to get a better sense of preexisting pulmonary
   disease
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl yesterday. Follow BP today. Will
   change to propofol today.
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   .
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: With diarrhea ?how much absorbing feeds. Check albumin,
   consider TPN if lower/stable and stop TFs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and later transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and is infected with MRSA. The patient also has sepsis of unknown origin, hypotension, anemia, gastritis/GERD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring daily wake-up calls will be taken to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as the use of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and compression stockings, will be implemented to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic therapy with proton pump inhibitors will be continued to prevent stress ulcers.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure: CXR appears worse today.
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Not able to wean on
   vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions. Sputum has grown MRSA.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin limiting resolution of
   the MRSA infection.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of element of
   pulmonary edema
   - Will review films from OSH to get a better sense of preexisting
   pulmonary disease
   # Hypotension: Now resolved on propofol.
   Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: With diarrhea ?how much absorbing feeds.  Will ask nutrition
   about changing tube feeds and await PICC line replacement for TPN given
   low albumin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) caused by MRSA, and there is a question of aspiration PNA. She also has hypotension, sepsis (now resolved), COPD with potential ILD, and diarrhea of unknown etiology. The patient's current medications include propofol, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and PPI IV.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Stress ulcers
4. Nosocomial infection due to prolonged ICU stay
5. Complications related to the underlying comorbidities such as CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD
6. Further deterioration of the respiratory status leading to respiratory failure
7. Development of new infections due to immunosuppression and invasive procedures
8. Malnutrition and poor nutritional status due to prolonged tube feeding and diarrhea
9. Possible gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers or other gastrointestinal issues
10. Arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, which is already present.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? Aspiration PNA).  Not able to wean on
   vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions. Sputum has grown MRSA.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin limiting resolution of
   the MRSA infection.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Increase PEEP back to 10 ([**4-17**])
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid, check vanco trough
   this AM
   - Repeat sputum today, broaden if increasing fever curve or evidence of
   other pathogens from sputum
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative
   - Obtain films from OSH to get a better sense of preexisting pulmonary
   disease
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl yesterday. Follow BP today. Will
   change to propofol today.
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  ? from
   pulmonary source.  UA/cx negative.  Sputum with MRSA.  Legionella
   antigen negative.  Stool culture (one c.diff included) negative.
   - Treating PNA as above, reculture if febrile
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - Repeat c.diff ([**4-15**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   - trend for now
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: With diarrhea ?how much absorbing feeds. Check albumin,
   consider TPN if lower/stable and stop TFs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has a picture most consistent with pneumonia (PNA), possibly aspiration pneumonia. She has subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin, which limits the resolution of the MRSA infection. The patient's hypoxia is worsening, and she has central patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. She also has a history of COPD and possible ILD, but is not on home oxygen. The patient experienced a witnessed aspiration event and then had a hypoxic event, leading to emergent intubation. She was ventilated with ARDSnet protocol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia. The hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia, and the presence of MRSA infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to the use of precedex and fentanyl. The plan is to change to propofol today.
3. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, now resolved, of unknown origin. She was normotensive and off pressors for several days. There is a suspicion of a pulmonary source of infection, with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible aspiration in the setting of chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to ventilator care bundles are essential to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is noted to have delirium/confusion, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients. Frequent reorientation, maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle, and minimizing sedative medications are important in managing this condition.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder indicated by the abnormal laboratory values. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary to correct imbalances and prevent further complications.
5. Infection: The patient has an identified MRSA infection, and there may be other potential infections given the presence of diarrhea and leukocyt"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old individual with respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to aspiration in the setting of chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate medical attention. The ARDS is causing severe lung inflammation and impaired gas exchange, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This type of infection is resistant to many antibiotics and can be difficult to treat. It poses a significant risk if not managed appropriately.

3. Hypotension: The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which may indicate poor circulation and inadequate organ perfusion. This can further complicate the management of respiratory failure and increase the risk of organ damage.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium (hypokalemia), low sodium (hyponatremia), and low magnesium (hypomagnesemia). These imbalances can affect cardiac function and other bodily systems.

5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium or confusion, which can be associated with severe illness, medications, or other factors. It is important to"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA.  Able to wean down support on vent a
   little yesterday. Sputum has grown MRSA repeatedly; vanco levels
   recently checked and therapeutic.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of element of
   pulmonary edema
   - Will have radiology formally review OSH images tomorrow
   # Anemia: Hcts have been trending down, no gross bleeding noted.  Iron
   studies c/w mild iron-deficiency.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be related to protracted
   hospital stay
   - repeat PM hct
   - guiac stools. Check b12, folate
   - T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits. No evidence for C diff here.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is now in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's allergies include latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamine (diphenhydramine Hcl), quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids (morphine), cortisone, iodine, levaquin (levofloxacin), and possibly others (please see POE for details). 

Her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 04/18/2172 at 07:34 AM. She is currently receiving various ICU medications, including Lansoprazole (Prevacid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), Furosemide (Lasix), and others. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diarrhea. Flowsheet data shows that her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 mmHg to 144/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has atrial fibrillation and is intubated on a CV/ASSIST mode with a set tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient opens her eyes to voice, has a tracheostomy in place, and clear lungs bilaterally without rales or wheezing. She also has irregularly irregular heart rhythm, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds, warm extremities with anasarca, and rectal tube draining light brown stool. Foley catheter and radial artery line are in place. 

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or not significantly abnormal. Chest X-ray shows patchy bilateral opacities, consistent with pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Sputum culture has grown MRSA. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypoxia respiratory failure, anemia, history of COPD and question of ILD, diarrhea, gastritis/GERD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and difficult wean from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has several allergies, including latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, and levaquin.
- The patient received various medications, including vancomycin, heparin sodium, furosemide (lasix), lansoprazole (prevacid), and others.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 to 144/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety, which improved with a trial dose of zydis.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,236 mL and output of 3,635 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,399 mL.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute.
- The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 248, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and alteration in nutrition.
- The patient has been receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
3. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to ICU stay and medications.
4. Delirium or confusion due to sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication effects.

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries tranfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA.  Able to wean down support on vent a
   little yesterday. Sputum has grown MRSA repeatedly; vanco levels
   recently checked and therapeutic.
   Patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and CXR with central patchy
   infiltrates that could represent pulmonary edema vs underlying ILD.
   Patient has hx ILD but is not on home O2. Had a witnessed aspiration
   and then had a hypoxic event where she acutely desated and became
   unresponsive requiring emergent intubation. P/F ratio 177 and CXR with
   bilateral infiltrates and she was ventilated with ardsnet protocol.
   Echo with preserved EF.  CT chest consistent with infection vs. ARDS.
   Bronchoscopy ([**4-15**]) appeared normal with BAL sent.
   - Ventilator: Respiratory alkalosis improved, continue Zydis for
   anxiety
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Diurese as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of element of
   pulmonary edema
   - Will have radiology formally review OSH images tomorrow
   # Anemia: Hcts have been trending down, no gross bleeding noted.  Iron
   studies c/w mild iron-deficiency.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be related to protracted
   hospital stay
   - repeat PM hct
   - guiac stools. Check b12, folate
   - T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.
   Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within
   normal limits. No evidence for C diff here.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   # Gastritis/ GERD:
   - Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   -  Holding simvastatin
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem
   - Continue metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and later transferred to the ICU for a second opinion on diarrhea. The patient continues to require intubation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypoxia and central patchy infiltrates on CXR, which could represent pulmonary edema or underlying ILD. She had a witnessed aspiration event and then experienced acute desaturation, becoming unresponsive and requiring emergent intubation.
2. Difficult Wean from Mechanical Ventilation: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating difficulty in weaning her off the ventilator.
3. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient's sputum has grown MRSA repeatedly, and vancomycin levels were recently checked and found to be therapeutic.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hcts have been trending down, suggesting anemia. Iron studies show mild iron-deficiency, which could be related to the protracted hospital stay.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has had extensive workup without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut (""short colon""), although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been ruled out, and microscopic colitis is under consideration with biopsies pending.
6. Gastritis/GERD: The patient"

   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Not able to wean on vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q 6 and albuterol q 4hrs PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of
   element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Holding immodium
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Hct stable.  Iron studies c/w mild
   iron-deficiency.  Not guaiac positive.
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia respiratory failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS. He has not been able to wean off the ventilator due to tachypnea and abundant secretions. The sputum has grown MRSA, and subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin have limited the resolution of the MRSA infection. Other medical issues include diarrhea of unknown etiology, anemia of unclear etiology, gastritis/GERD, CAD, hypothyroidism, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the presence of MRSA in the sputum, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has had extensive workup without a definitive diagnosis. Considering his multiple abdominal surgeries and the presence of secretory diarrhea, it is important to consider short gut syndrome or microscopic colitis as possible causes.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unclear etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Gastritis/GERD: The patient is receiving IV PPI for gastritis/GERD. However"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and subsequently transferred to this hospital for a second opinion on diarrhea. The patient continues to require intubation and has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS. He is also experiencing anemia of unclear etiology, diarrhea without a definitive diagnosis, a history of COPD and ILD, atrial fibrillation, sepsis likely secondary to MRSA pneumonia, gastritis/GERD, CAD, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is currently critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS.
2. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA in the sputum and BAL fluid indicates a potential complication of MRSA pneumonia, which may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is trending down, but the exact cause is unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea with extensive workup without diagnosis. Considering the ongoing symptoms and negative infectious screens, microscopic colitis is being considered, and biopsies are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure and likely aspiration with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient's baseline ILD is also mentioned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, which can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to aspiration and MRSA pneumonia.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on supplemental oxygen, indicating ongoing hypoxemia.
3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, which may require correction.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of delirium or confusion, which can be a result of various factors such as sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, or medication effects.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is experiencing AFIB, a type of cardiac arrhythmia.

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Not able to wean on vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of
   element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety\
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; trending down.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR though
   diarrhea decreased on [**4-19**]
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia and ARDS, and his sputum has grown MRSA. He has also been experiencing diarrhea with an unclear etiology. Other medical conditions include anemia, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, gastritis/GERD, CAD, hypothyroidism, and hypotension. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, inotropes, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation levels is necessary.
2. MRSA Infection: The presence of MRSA in the sputum suggests a potential infection that may require additional antibiotics or changes in the current antibiotic regimen.
3. Diarrhea: The underlying cause of the patient's diarrhea is still uncertain, and further investigations are needed to determine the appropriate management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating a possible decline in red blood cell count. Additional evaluation and management may be required to address this issue.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The"

   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 1L negative in case of
   element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety\
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; trending down.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR though
   diarrhea decreased on [**4-19**]
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and transferred from OSH for a second opinion on diarrhea. The patient continues to require intubation due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS. His sputum has grown MRSA, and subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin have limited the resolution of the MRSA infection. The patient's other medical issues include anemia, diarrhea, COPD/ILD, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, gastritis/GERD, CAD, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma from mechanical ventilation
   - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
   - Aspiration pneumonia

2. Infectious Complications:
   - MRSA infection due to inadequate vancomycin levels
   - Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

3. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Hypotension due to sepsis or medication effects
   - Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation

4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Diarrhea of unknown etiology

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with respiratory failure. They are on mechanical ventilation and have been sedated. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and delirium/confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and sedation can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
6. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and critical illness can result in delirium, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note and potential medical complications. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient."

   The ET tube tip, the NG tube, and the left internal jugular line are in
   unchanged positions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There
   is
   interval worsening of the left perihilar opacity but minimal
   improvement in
   the right upper lung opacity giving overall unchanged picture. There is
   small
   bilateral pleural effusion that is not significantly different from the

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Not able to wean on vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 500ml-1L negative in case
   of element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety\
   - Cont PS trial daily
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; trending down.
   - Daily Hct
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR though
   diarrhea decreased on [**4-19**]
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old individual who underwent recent abdominal surgery and presented with chronic diarrhea, likely aspiration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure with poor lung compliance. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 112/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance of 19.4 cmH2O/mL.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, malnutrition, anxiety, and renal failure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and platelet count within normal range. The patient's serum electrolytes indicate low potassium and magnesium levels.

The plan includes continuing diuresis, synchronizing respiratory support, decreasing PEEP to 5, initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuing tube feeds, managing atrial fibrillation, addressing anxiety, and reassessing sedation.

   # Hypoxia Resp Failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Not able to wean on vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 500ml-1L negative in case
   of element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety\
   - Cont PS trial daily
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; trending down.
   - Daily Hct
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR though
   diarrhea decreased on [**4-19**]
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and continues to require intubation. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxia, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, anemia, diarrhea, history of COPD and ILD, sepsis, gastritis/GERD, CAD, hypothyroidism, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential risk for further respiratory distress and inadequate tissue perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests ongoing respiratory failure, which can lead to complications such as pneumonia and lung injury.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm may contribute to poor cardiac output and increase the risk of clot formation and stroke.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can affect various organ functions, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous system.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status can lead to difficulties with communication, decision-making, and increased risk of falls and accidents.
6. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hemoglobin levels may result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and ARDS:
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Not able to wean on vent, still tachypneic with abundant secretions.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   - Ventilator: Overbreathing vent with consequent respiratory alkalosis
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue diuresis as BP tolerates, try for 500ml-1L negative in case
   of element of pulmonary edema
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety\
   - Cont PS trial daily
   - Decrease PEEP to 5
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; trending down.
   - Daily Hct
   # Diarrhea:   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading
   diagnosis is short gut (""short colon"") although short colon does not
   typically cause diarrhea. Infections have been repeated r/o.
   Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at
   OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH
   pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF
   were restarted ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more
   suggestive of a secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff
   negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Plan to start TPN on [**4-20**] once PICC placement confirmed via IR though
   diarrhea decreased on [**4-19**]
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**])
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and ARDS, and is not able to wean off the ventilator. Sputum has grown MRSA, and the patient has subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin limiting the resolution of the MRSA infection. The patient also has anemia of unclear etiology, diarrhea without a clear diagnosis, a history of COPD and ILD, atrial fibrillation, sepsis secondary to MRSA pneumonia, gastritis/GERD, CAD, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and colonization with MRSA.
2. Non-infectious lung injury or worsening ARDS due to ongoing respiratory support and potential complications from mechanical ventilation.
3. Development of further electrolyte and fluid disorders due to ongoing losses through diarrhea and renal function impairment.
4. Cardiovascular complications such as heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias due to underlying CAD and CHF.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to severe gastritis/GERD or other gastrointestinal conditions.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged imm"

   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Holding on TPN for now
   # History COPD and question of ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**]). Change to long acting
   dilt
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Sepsis: Now normotensive and off pressors for several days.  Likely
   secondary to MRSA pneumonia
   - Treating PNA as above, re-culture if febrile
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved
   on propofol

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (likely aspiration-related) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been treated with vancomycin for MRSA infection but has subtherapeutic levels. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, anemia of unclear etiology, diarrhea, possible short gut syndrome, and microscopic colitis. Other conditions include COPD/ILD, atrial fibrillation, sepsis secondary to MRSA pneumonia, gastritis/GERD, CAD, and hypothyroidism. The patient's hypotension is likely due to precedex, but it has resolved on propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia likely due to aspiration, and there is a persistent left perihilar opacity on the chest X-ray. This indicates an ongoing lung infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.

2. ARDS: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This can result in decreased oxygen levels and difficulty breathing. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, as indicated by"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic diarrhea, respiratory failure due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has multiple allergies, including latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, levaquin, and more.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 129/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient also has multiple infusions and is on tube feeds.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with warm skin. She has an endotracheal tube and an OG tube in place. Her extremities show trace edema. Neurological examination shows that she follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but is sedated.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Other lab values include elevated blood glucose, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows multifocal infiltrates"

   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Hypoxia Resp Failure:
   Doing well post extubation
   Picture most consistent w/ PNA (? aspiration) with subsequent ARDS.
   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   Clinically has improved with diuresis.
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA
   - Check vanc trough in AM
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of
   bronchospasm
   - Continue zydis to help manage any component of anxiety
   - Hold off on further lasix  today as she is [**Last Name (LF) 7633**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] follow
   I/O
   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Holding on TPN for now
   # Alkalosis
   Improved today
   ABG this AM consistent with metabolic alkalosis ?contraction from
   diuresis versus lasix effect
   - Kcl repletion
   - Follow
   # Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.
   - Can check plain films to assess for tapable effusion
   - Tylenol prn pain
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # History COPD and  ILD: Not on home O2.
   - Holding Advair and Singulair while intubated
   - Continue nebs, flovent while intubated
   - Otherwise treatment as above
   # Afib:  In and out of afib.  Rate now better controlled on metoprolol.
   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**]). Change to long acting
   dilt
   - Should be on coumadin for anticoagulation but will hold until GI
   decides about scope and until d/c from ICU
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**]. Now resolved

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and subsequently transferred to this ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and continues to require mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved post-extubation, but he still requires high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, which suggests a respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. The presence of bilateral patchy opacities on chest X-ray, especially in the right upper lung fields, along with the finding of MRSA in the sputum, suggests a possible pneumonia with aspiration. 

2. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which has been extensive and without a definitive diagnosis. The stool volume has improved with the use of Vivonex. Infections have been ruled out, and short gut (""short colon"") is being considered as a leading diagnosis. Microscopic colitis is also under consideration, and biopsies are pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered. 

3. Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis has improved today, possibly due to diuresis or lasix effect. Potassium repletion"

   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut

   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.

   - Continue diltiazem and metoprolol (added [**4-14**]). Change to long acting

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and diarrhea. The patient has a history of multiple allergies and was previously on various medications including antibiotics. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial in the evening and was successfully extubated with stable ABG results. He is self-diuresing negative and tolerating pills post-extubation. The patient has a long-standing medical history, including wrist pain. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation support. His ABG shows a slightly alkalotic pH with adequate oxygenation. Physical examination reveals bilateral inspiratory wheezing and crackles in the lungs, as well as cool extremities with mild edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and platelets, along with other abnormalities. The patient's chest X-ray shows increased bilateral patchy opacities, particularly in the right upper lung fields, and a left pleural effusion. The sputum culture is positive for MRSA. The patient is on multiple prophylactic medications and has a full code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and infection signs is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous"

   Sputum has grown MRSA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had subtherapeutic levels on vancomycin
   limiting resolution of the MRSA infection.
   Clinically has improved with diuresis.
   - Continue Vanc (Day 1 = [**4-11**]) for MRSA in BAL fluid and sputum from
   [**4-17**] for MRSA PNA, will continue for a total of an 8-day course
   - Continue ipratropium q6 and albuterol q4 PRN for component of

   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut

   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Holding on TPN for now and will advance diet as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently intubated. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, diarrhea, and other medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His current ABG results show a pH of 7.47, indicating a respiratory alkalosis.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient's sputum has grown MRSA, suggesting a potential infection. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, but subtherapeutic levels were found on [**Month (only) 51**].
3. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which has been improving on Vivonex. Extensive workup has been done without a definitive diagnosis. Short gut syndrome, infections, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and other causes are being considered.
4. Alkalosis: The patient's ABG this morning indicates metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to diuresis or Lasix effect. Kcl repletion is recommended.
5. Wrist Pain: The patient complains of wrist pain, which may be related to arthritis or pseudogout. Plain films should be checked to assess for a tapable effusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with respiratory failure due to likely aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She has a history of chronic inflammatory lung disease (ILD), chronic diarrhea, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's wrist pain has resolved, and she no longer requires tube feeds for diarrhea. Her AFib has transitioned into sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome may progress, leading to further respiratory failure and difficulty in oxygenation.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is at risk for delirium or confusion due to her critical illness and multiple medications.
4. Wrist Pain: Although the patient's wrist pain has resolved, she may still require physical therapy to regain strength and mobility.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib, although currently in sinus rhythm, can recur and potentially lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to maintain adequate blood pressure.
7. Electrolyte/Fluid Disorder:"

   80F with sarcoid/ILD,  chronic diarrhea, presented for 2nd opinion and
   developed resp failure likely from aspiration / ards / mrsa pna now
   with increasing respiratory distress
   Resp failure: baseline ILD, mrsa pna. Concerning that her WBC has
   increased.  Is this a new infection vs decompensated ILD?
   Also likely [**1-6**] in at least part to her Afib with RVR. PE seems less
   likely
   -finsih 8-day course of vanco ([**4-17**] = day 1). Would favor broadening
   coverage (complicated by multiple allergies): Cefepime/Cipro.
   - Atrovent nebulizers
   -continues to auto-diurese, does not look wet
   -repeat ABG, may need to consider NIPPV given her increased work of
   breathing. However sedation with this may cause problems with worsening
   acidosis
   - prn anxiety with NIPPV (morphine)
   A-fib with RVR: likely driven by her hypoxemia and or underlying ILD
   process.
   - Amiodarone load today

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented for a second opinion and subsequently developed respiratory failure likely from aspiration or ARDS/MRSA pneumonia. She has increasing respiratory distress and is now on supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib with RVR), hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She also has electrolyte and fluid disorders, confusion, and delirium. The patient has multiple allergies, including latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, iodine, levaquin, and heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and previous history of ILD suggest that she is at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The increased white blood cell count could indicate a new infection, which may be complicated by her immunocompromised state due to chronic illness and treatment.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib with RVR): The patient's A-fib with RVR may be driven by hypoxemia or underlying ILD process. It needs to be managed with amiodarone and possibly a reduction in diltiazem drip.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill 80-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis/ILD, chronic diarrhea, and recent respiratory failure likely from aspiration/ARDS/MRSA PNA. She presented for a second opinion and developed increasing respiratory distress. She is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and potential new infection versus decompensated ILD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's baseline ILD and recent MRSA PNA have already led to respiratory failure. There is concern about a new infection or decompensation of ILD.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib with RVR): The patient's A-fib with RVR may be driven by hypoxemia and underlying ILD process. It needs to be managed with amiodarone loading and weaning of diltiazem drip.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia needs to be addressed through interventions such as NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) and repeat ABG (arterial blood gas analysis).
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible new infection or worsening of the existing condition.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance needs to be corrected and monitored closely.
7. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status changes need to be evaluated and managed.
8. Potential new infection: The patient's increasing WBC count raises concerns about a new infection.
9. Decompensated ILD: The patient's worsening respiratory distress could be due to decompensated ILD.
10. Anxiety: The patient is anxious, and her anxiety needs to be managed with medications like zyprexa and prn morphine.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of chronic diarrhea and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure likely due to aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia (MRSA). The patient has been admitted for 8 days and is still experiencing hypoxia despite completing an 8-day course of vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 121 beats per minute, blood pressure 159/135 mmHg, respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on a face tent.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the resolution of diarrhea with tube feeds. Physical examination reveals well-nourished but overweight/obese appearance, atrial fibrillation with irregular rhythm, bilateral crackles at the lung bases, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, absent peripheral pulses, and inability to stand. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time and place, but movement, tone, and skin assessment could not be evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with low albumin and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium"

   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Respiratory distress
   More tachypneic and uncomfortable appearing today. CXR improved today.
   Leukocytosis today concerning for brewing infection. Sputum has
   previously grown MRSA. Think PE is less likely.
   - Plan to broaden HCAP coverage with cefepime and ciprofloxacin,
   continuing vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**] therapeutic)
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and cx
   - Repeat ABG
   - Consider NIPPV
   - Holding on further diuresis
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine
   - On levalbuterol nebs prn, consider changing back to atrovent though
   unclear to what extent bronchodilators are helping her
   - Will talk with her primary pulmonologist to clarify how her dx of
   sarcoid was made
   - Discuss with patient and family about wishes in regards to
   reintubation
   # Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and metoprolol
   overnight
   - Will load with amiodarone today, wean dilt as tolerated
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Holding on TPN for now and will advance diet as tolerated
   # Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.
   - Plain films today
   - Tylenol prn pain
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved.  Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   Now resolved on propofol

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and continues to require intubation. The patient has several medical complications, including anxiety, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypotension (not in shock), hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals inspiratory wheezing/squeaks and fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally, dry mouth, and tenderness in the left wrist.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 646 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, normal glucose level of 109 mg/dL, low potassium level of 0.6 mg/dL, slightly elevated sodium level of 27 mEq"

   # Respiratory distress
   More tachypneic and uncomfortable appearing today. CXR improved today.
   Leukocytosis today concerning for brewing infection. Sputum has
   previously grown MRSA. Think PE is less likely.  WBC appears real and
   has stabilized.  ? underlying lung disease
   - Plan to broaden HCAP coverage with cefepime and ciprofloxacin,
   continuing vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**] therapeutic)
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and cx
   - Repeat ABGs
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Holding on further diuresis
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   - ? underlying lung disease -> review [**Hospital1 1031**] records
   - Per patient and family, would NOT wish re-intubation
   # Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont load with amiodarone today, wean dilt as tolerated
   - Change to PO amio when load finished
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI consulted; will see patient once extubated
   - Holding on TPN for now and will advance diet as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, leukocytosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium, anxiety, alteration in nutrition, and multiple comorbidities such as CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and continues to require intubation. The patient has several medical conditions that need to be managed, including gastritis/GERD, anemia, CAD, hypothyroidism, and B12 deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to underlying lung disease and infection. Broadening HCAP coverage with cefepime and ciprofloxacin is planned to address the brewing infection. Repeat sputum gram stain and culture, ABGs, and NIPPV may be necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rate was poorly controlled despite medication, but she has been converted back to sinus rhythm with amiodarone load. Continuous monitoring and management of heart rhythm are required.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved but may recur if not properly managed. Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting medications as needed is essential.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis suggests an ongoing infection. Monitoring WBC count and adjusting antibiotic coverage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she received amiodarone treatment. She also has multiple allergies, including to aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, levaquin, and azithromycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/80 to 160/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool face tent with SpO2 of 126 PaO2/FiO2.

The patient's physical examination revealed inspiratory wheezing/squeaks and fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally in the lungs, as well as soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds. The extremities were cool without lower extremity edema, and the left wrist was tender to palpation and passive/active flex/extend with no erythema or increased warmth.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin-T levels. The patient's electrolytes were also imbalanced, with low potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels.

Assessment and plan include anxiety, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte/fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest a possible infection and sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the recent conversion back to sinus rhythm may predispose her to other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney injury.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels (potassium, magnesium, calcium) are abnormal and need correction to avoid complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged bed rest increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may progress to delirium, which can increase the risk of falls and other complications.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition status due to prolonged NPO status and lack of enteral or parenteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and associated complications.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and tend"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range (82 bpm), blood pressure within normal range (128/80 mmHg), respiratory rate slightly elevated (23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate for pain management and heparin sodium as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids since April 23rd. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.1 to 22.4 thousand cells per microliter. The hemoglobin levels are within normal range, but the platelet count is low at 646 thousand cells per microliter. The creatinine levels are within normal range, and the blood glucose levels are well-controlled. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), as well as an elevated lactate level.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, and neurologic examination is also not performed. 

The patient's current medications include morphine sulfate for pain management, heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, and antibiotics such as cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin"

   silhouette is unchanged. There is slight interval additional
   improvement in
   the parenchymal opacities that might represent a process of fluctuation
   of
   superimposed pulmonary edema giving the more involvement of the lung
   parenchyma than on for example [**2172-4-18**] or [**2172-4-20**], although
   note is
   made that the improvement of the lung parenchyma may lag after clinical
   improvement. There is slightly more lucent area in the right suprahilar
   area
   that may represent either parenchyma or a pneumatocele that might be
   further
   observed on the subsequent studies.
   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Respiratory distress
   Appears more comfortable today. WBC trending down. Sputum has
   previously grown MRSA.
   - Continue cefepime (day 1=[**4-23**]) and vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**]
   therapeutic)
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and cx
   - Repeat ABG
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Holding on further diuresis
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   - ? underlying lung disease -> review [**Hospital1 1031**] records. Pt had been
   diagnosed with sarcoidosis previously.
   - Per patient and family, would NOT wish re-intubation
   # Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont load with amiodarone today, wean dilt as tolerated
   - Change to PO amio when load finished
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex -> now on TPN
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI input appreciated, scope when respiratory status improves
   # Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.  XRay
   with cystic luceny -> ? underlying fracture
   - Final read plain films
   - Tylenol prn pain
   - D/w ortho or rads regarding findings, though even if small fx would
   not operate
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved.  Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   Now resolved on propofol
   # B12 deficiency: Start supplements (PO if tolerated)
   # Hyponatremia
   - Check PM lytes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. She is currently intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's sputum has previously grown MRSA. Her WBC count is trending down. She has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis previously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying lung disease is not managed effectively.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient's sputum has grown MRSA, indicating a potential infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered to treat this infection.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which has not been fully diagnosed. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the diarrhea.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with unclear etiology. Regular monitoring of Hct and T+S is necessary, and transfusion should be considered if hemoglobin levels drop below 7.
5. Gastritis/GERD: The patient is experiencing gastritis/GERD, and PPI IV should be continued to manage these conditions.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and it is important to discuss the need for ASA with the"

   of
   superimposed pulmonary edema giving the more involvement of the lung
   parenchyma than on for example [**2172-4-18**] or [**2172-4-20**], although
   note is
   made that the improvement of the lung parenchyma may lag after clinical
   improvement. There is slightly more lucent area in the right suprahilar
   area
   that may represent either parenchyma or a pneumatocele that might be
   further
   observed on the subsequent studies.
   Assessment/Plan:  80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple
   abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who
   was admitted to MICU for hypoxia.  Continues to require intubation.
   # Respiratory distress
   Appears more comfortable today. WBC trending down. Sputum has
   previously grown MRSA.
   - Continue cefepime (day 1=[**4-23**]) and vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**]
   therapeutic)
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and cx
   - Repeat ABG
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Holding on further diuresis
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   - ? underlying lung disease -> review [**Hospital1 1031**] records. Pt had been
   diagnosed with sarcoidosis previously.
   - Per patient and family, would NOT wish re-intubation
   # Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont load with amiodarone today, wean dilt as tolerated
   - Change to PO amio when load finished
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   # Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex -> now on TPN
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI input appreciated, scope when respiratory status improves
   # Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.  XRay
   with cystic luceny -> ? underlying fracture
   - Final read plain films
   - Tylenol prn pain
   - D/w ortho or rads regarding findings, though even if small fx would
   not operate
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   # Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   # CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears to
   have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved.  Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   Now resolved on propofol
   # B12 deficiency: Start supplements (PO if tolerated)
   # Hyponatremia
   - Check PM lytes

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She slept well on trazodone last night. She is less tachypneic and is
   back in NSR too. She has not needed NIPPV and has decided against
   re-intubation. Her daughter slept at her bedside last night . Her cough
   is weak but her voice is stronger.
   Agree with plan to support caloric needs with TPN for now and wean O2
   as tolerated. She will transition to a chair during the day if possible
   to allow restoration of circadian physiology with the aid of trazodone
   at night. I am hopeful that with the appropriate antibiotics and
   nutritional support she will have another attempt at a speech/ swallow
   evaluation next week. If she should decline, she will be made a CMO.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and continues to require intubation. The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and she is more comfortable today. Her WBC count is trending down, and sputum has previously grown MRSA. The patient's atrial fibrillation rate was poorly controlled but has since converted back to sinus rhythm with amiodarone loading. She has been diagnosed with short gut syndrome and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's wrist pain may be due to pseudogout or restraints. She has anemia of unclear etiology, gastritis/GERD, CAD, hypothyroidism, hypotension, B12 deficiency, and hyponatremia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be made a comfort measure only patient if she declines further interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if she develops pneumonia or experiences further deterioration in her lung function.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient's sputum has previously grown MRSA, indicating a possible infection. If not properly treated, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially systemic infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries
   transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who was admitted to MICU
   for hypoxia, now s/p intubation.
   1. Respiratory distress
   Etiology is unclear. Initial event was likely related to pneumonia and
   ARDS. She had improved but then on [**2172-4-23**] developed a new WBC. Today
   she looks improved. Appears more comfortable today. WBC trending down.
   Her underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, although she may have
   sarcoidosis.
   - Continue cefepime (day 1=[**4-23**]) and vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**]
   therapeutic)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   - Spiriva
   - Will try trial of solumedrol given tightness on exam.  She is
   adequately being treated for infection currently
   - Check venous ABG
   2. Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont amiodarone
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   3. Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex -> now on TPN
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI input appreciated, scope when respiratory status improves
   4. Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.  XRay
   with cystic luceny -> ? underlying fracture
   - Final read plain films
   - Tylenol prn pain

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries.
- The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and is now intubated.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, which initially was likely related to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There has been some improvement, but a new white blood cell count (WBC) was noted on April 23rd. The underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, and sarcoidosis may be a possibility.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) that is poorly controlled despite medication. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
- The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, and extensive workup has been done without a clear diagnosis. Short gut syndrome is a leading diagnosis, but infections have been ruled out. Microscopic colitis is under consideration, and biopsies are pending. Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered. Once tube feeding (TF) was restarted, the diarrhea worsened. Stool osmotic gap is suggestive of a secretory diarrhea.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries
   transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who was admitted to MICU
   for hypoxia, now s/p intubation.
   1. Respiratory distress
   Etiology is unclear. Initial event was likely related to pneumonia and
   ARDS. She had improved but then on [**2172-4-23**] developed a new WBC. Today
   she looks improved. Appears more comfortable today. WBC trending down.
   Her underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, although she may have
   sarcoidosis.
   - Continue cefepime (day 1=[**4-23**]) and vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**]
   therapeutic)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   2. Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont amiodarone
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   3. Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex -> now on TPN
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI input appreciated, scope when respiratory status improves
   4. Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.  XRay
   with cystic luceny -> ? underlying fracture
   - Final read plain films
   - Tylenol prn pain
   - D/w ortho or rads regarding findings, though even if small fx would
   not operate
   5. Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   6. Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   7. CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   8. Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears
   to have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   9.Hypotension: Now resolved.  Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   Now resolved on propofol
   10.Hyponatremia
   Sodium is improved with sodium of 135 today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was transferred to the ICU from the MICU for respiratory distress, which initially improved but then worsened due to a new white blood cell count. The patient's underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, possibly sarcoidosis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which has been poorly controlled despite medical interventions. She has also been experiencing diarrhea, with stool volume improving on Vivonex but worsening when total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was restarted. The cause of the diarrhea remains undiagnosed, with potential causes including short gut syndrome, infections, microscopic colitis, gastrin elevation, pancreatic insufficiency, and secretory diarrhea.

The patient also presents with wrist pain, which may be due to pseudogout or underlying fracture. Anemia of unclear etiology has been stabilized without gross bleeding. She has a history of gastritis/GERD, CAD, hypothyroidism, hypotension, and hyponatremia, all of which require ongoing management.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The etiology is unclear, but initial events were likely related to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, although sarcoidosis may be a possibility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of experiencing hallucinations. The patient has a history of allergies to various medications and substances, including latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and more. The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin) within the last 24 hours. The patient is currently on heparin sodium and ranitidine for prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/40 mmHg to 180/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient has received respiratory support with high flow nebulization.

Physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses and skin assessments are not performed. Neurological assessment is also incomplete.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly high potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers are within normal ranges.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which was believed to be multifactorial in nature, possibly related to sarcoidosis, COPD, aspiration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was extubated on 04/21.

On review of systems, the patient has been without complaints or events. Allergies include latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamine (diphenhydramine Hcl), quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids (morphine), cortisone, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and more, as noted in the past medical evaluation.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefepime on 04/24 at 02:00 PM, vancomycin on 04/25 at 08:46 AM, and ciprofloxacin on 04/25 at 10:46 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, and COPD. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which was determined to be multifactorial, possibly related to sarcoidosis, COPD, aspiration, and ARDS. The patient has been extubated and is currently on low-dose morphine for air hunger. He is experiencing dyspnea and wheezing, indicating possible COPD exacerbation.

24-hour events:
No significant complaints or events have been reported.

Medical history:
The patient has a history of allergies to latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids (related to hallucinations), cortisone, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and amiodarone. However, the specific details of these allergies are documented in the POE (preoperative evaluation) section.

Medications:
The patient has been receiving various medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ranitidine, heparin sodium, Plavix, Synthroid, nortriptyline, RISS, olanzapine, atrovent, flovent, lidocaine patch, and amiodarone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is worsening respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including latex, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamines, quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids, cortisone, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and more. The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime) on [**2172-4-25**]. Infusions include morphine sulfate and ranitidine. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission. 

Review of systems is unchanged except for worsening respiratory distress on [**2172-4-25**] morning. Non-invasive ventilation was attempted but not tolerated due to discomfort. The patient was transitioned to comfort measures only and is comfortable on a morphine drip. 

Vital signs show tachycardia (147 bpm), hypotension (65/38 mmHg), low respiratory rate (10 insp/min), and SpO2 of 97%. The patient is experiencing a supra ventricular tachycardia. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,518 mL and total output of 1,010 mL with a negative balance of 508 mL. 

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent, ventilator mode set to standby, Vt (spontaneous) at 338 mL, PS at 12 cmH2O, RR (spontaneous) at 45, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 of 97%. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and more. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (14.6), decreased hematocrit (28.8), elevated platelet count (723 K/uL), normal creatinine (0.6), elevated total CO2 (39), normal glucose (122), and more. 

Assessment and plan include impaired balance, aerobic capacity/endurance, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypotension (not in shock), hypoxemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte & fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, and more. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (multi-lumen and PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and comfort measures. The patient's code status is comfort measures only."

   Etiology is unclear. Initial event was likely related to pneumonia and
   ARDS. She had improved but then on [**2172-4-23**] developed a new WBC. Today
   she looks improved. Appears more comfortable today. WBC trending down.
   Her underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, although she may have
   sarcoidosis.
   - Continue cefepime (day 1=[**4-23**]) and vanco (day 1=[**4-11**], [**4-17**]
   therapeutic)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Consider NIPPV if needed -> NO intubation
   - Continue to treat anxiety, on olanzapine, can use low dose morphine
   - Cont atrovent though unclear to what extent bronchodilators are
   helping her
   - Spiriva
   - Will try trial of solumedrol given tightness on exam.  She is
   adequately being treated for infection currently
   - Check venous ABG
   2. Afib
   Rate poorly controlled despite dilt drip, bolus IV dilt and
   metoprolol.  Now back in sinus with amio load
   - Cont amiodarone
   - Continuing to hold on anticoagulation
   3. Diarrhea:
   Stool volume much improved on Vivonex -> now on TPN
   Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis. Leading diagnosis is short gut
   (""short colon"") although short colon does not typically cause diarrhea.
   Infections have been repeated r/o. Microscopic colitis is under
   consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH. Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA
   minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending. Pancreatic
   insufficiency should also be considered.  Once TF were restarted
   ([**Date range (1) 625**]) diarrhea worsened.  Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a
   secretory diarrhea. TTG within normal limits; c.diff negative x2.
   - Continue nortriptyline
   - Restart immodium ([**4-19**])
   - OSH colon biopsy, VIP pending
   - GI input appreciated, scope when respiratory status improves
   4. Wrist pain
   Will need to clarify whether any history of arthritis (pt denies
   today). Consider pseudogout given acute illness, joint however does not
   appear to be inflamed. [**Month (only) 51**] also be sore from wrist restraints.  XRay
   with cystic luceny -> ? underlying fracture
   - Final read plain films
   - Tylenol prn pain
   - D/w ortho or rads regarding findings, though even if small fx would
   not operate
   5. Anemia: Unclear etiology; stablilized  no gross bleeding
   - Daily Hct, T+S, transfuse hb>7
   6. Gastritis/ GERD: Continue PPI IV
   7. CAD: Not on ASA? Will discuss with patient once extubated.
   - Continue plavix
   - Holding simvastatin
   8. Hypothyroidism: TSH was 3.71 at OSH and Levothyroxine dose appears
   to have been decreased from 200mg to 100mg daily.
   9.Hypotension: Now resolved.  Likely due to precedex, Fentanyl on [**4-16**].
   Now resolved on propofol
   10.Hyponatremia
   Sodium is improved with sodium of 135 today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the medical ICU for hypoxia and later intubated due to respiratory distress. 

The patient's respiratory distress has continued to decline since extubation, and comfort measures only were initiated. Antibiotics and steroids were discontinued. Her underlying lung disease diagnosis is unclear, although she may have sarcoidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory distress: The etiology of the respiratory distress is unclear, with initial events likely related to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's underlying lung disease diagnosis is uncertain, although sarcoidosis may be a possibility. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are crucial.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a poorly controlled heart rate. Despite diltiazem drip, bolus IV diltiazem, and metoprolol, the patient's rate remains poorly controlled. She has been loaded with amiodarone and is now back in sinus rhythm. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and ongoing management of any arrhythmias are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated. Despite extubation, the patient's respiratory distress continued to decline, leading to a decision to transition to comfort measures only. The patient is comfortable on a morphine drip, and antibiotics and steroids have been discontinued. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 147 bpm, blood pressure of 65/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's worsening respiratory distress and decision to transition to comfort measures only, there is a high risk of respiratory failure. The patient may require increased support with non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's low blood pressure and presence of SVT indicate compromised cardiac function. There is a risk of cardiac arrest due to the combination of the patient's underlying cardiac conditions and the current respiratory distress.
3. Infection: Although antibiotics have been discontinued, the patient still has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which suggests the presence of an ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level indicates potential organ dysfunction, specifically impaired tissue perfusion. Close monitoring of organ function and supportive measures are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Comfort and Symptom Management: Given the patient's decision to forgo aggressive treatment, ensuring comfort and managing symptoms effectively is crucial. Regular reassessment of pain, anxiety, and other symptoms should be conducted to optimize the patient's quality of life during this period."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with multiple pulmonary comorbidities including possible sarcoidosis, COPD, aspiration, and ARDS. She was extubated five days ago but continued to experience respiratory distress and overall decline, leading to the decision of comfort measures only (CMO). 

The patient has a history of unknown allergies to various medications such as latex gloves, aspirin, colchicine, antihistamine (diphenhydramine Hcl), quinolones, vasodilators, loratadine, theophylline, opioids (morphine) related to hallucinations, cortisone, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and more. 

Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 144 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/38 mmHg to 137/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is in a supraventricular tachycardia rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,518 mL and output of 1,010 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 508 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (723 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (10.2 g/dL), high potassium level (5.8 mEq/L), slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (26 mEq"
