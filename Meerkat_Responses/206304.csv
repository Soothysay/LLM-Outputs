   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7930**] is a 69 year old female with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II
   varices transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology although differential includes
   HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large amounts of
   stool output.  ATN less likely as patient has not had episodes of
   hypotension. The patient has received HRS therapy with midodrine,
   octreotide, and albumin for two days with worsening renal function, and
   renal was consulted this morning prior to transfer.
   - UA, urine lytes, urine osm
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide therapy for HRS
   - Follow-up renal recs
   - Trend UOP, lytes Q12H
   - Can consider renal ultrasound if renal function does not improve.
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Differential includes uremia/ARF, CVA, portal vein
   thrombosis, DVT, GIB, or infectious process including SBP, HAP, or UTI.
   SBP less likely given that the patient had a diagnostic paracentesis
   yesterday with WBC 261, PMN 24%, although this was on ciprofloxacin
   that was changed to ceftriaxone today.  In addition, CTH on [**8-21**] was
   negative and abdominal U/S on [**8-18**] that was negative for thrombosis.
   Most recent urine culture from [**8-20**] negative.  DVT less likely in
   setting of coagulopathy secondary to liver disease.
   - Repeat CXR given aspiration risk and fever, abdominal U/S with
   dopplers to assess for portal vein thrombosis
   - Repeat blood and urine cultures
   - Lactulose and rifaxmin
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide, and SPA as above
   - Follow-up culture data, continue ceftriaxone for SBP coverage
   - Guaiac stools
   - Minimize potential contributing medications including metoclopramide.
   .
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process in conjunction with
   patient's worsening encephalopathy.  Given the patients AMS, she is
   also at high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
   - Infectious etiology work-up as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP for now pending cultures
   - Follow-up cultures
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
   Transplant work-up complete per floor team.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, nadolol, midodrine, octreotide, and
   albumin.
   - Follow-up liver recs if any
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Most recent anion-gap 15.  Likely
   secondary to acute renal failure. Most recent lactate yesterday was 2.
   - Trend lytes, AG
   .
   # Anemia: Patient recieved 1 unit PRBC yesterday.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ
   perfusion
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count stable during admission.
   Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration in setting
   of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Rhythmn: Patient developed intermitent narrow complex atrial
   tachycardia s/p bowel movement on [**8-20**] with intermitent sinus block.
   - Continue nadolol for AV nodal blockade
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed.  Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI, nadolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals.
   - Check residuals
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient experienced several significant events during her stay in the ICU, including atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and hemodynamic instability. She received multiple blood products and interventions to stabilize her condition. The patient's renal function has not improved despite receiving HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. There are concerns about potential complications such as acute renal failure, encephalopathy, fever, ESLD, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, rhythm disturbances, hematochezia, and gastroparesis. The patient is currently on multiple medications including lactulose, rifaximin, nadolol, midodrine, octreotide, albumin, ceftriaxone, and PPI. She is also receiving nutrition support and has various lines and tubes in place. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has not improved despite receiving HRS therapy. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this complication."

   CXR
   An NGT is visualized which is coiled multiple times within the
   stomach and its distal tip projects over the expected region of the
   antrum of
   the stomach. Since the prior study, there is increased retrocardiac
   density,
   likely representing atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   Slightly
   more prominent appearance to the pulmonary vessels including the region
   of the
   azygos vein may suggest some developing fluid overload. Clinical
   correlation
   is needed. CP angles remain sharply delineated.
   Liver u/s
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Slightly limited evaluation. However, apparently patent hepatic
   vasculature but with continued slow flow within the main portal vein.
   Previously described possible nonocclusive thrombus in the main portal
   vein
   wall is not seen on today's study.
   2. Diffuse echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis.
   3. Mild-to-moderate amount of ascites.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old female with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Differential includes uremia/ARF, CVA, portal vein
   thrombosis, DVT, GIB, or infectious process including SBP, HAP, or UTI.
   SBP less likely given that the patient had a diagnostic paracentesis
   yesterday with WBC 261, PMN 24%, although this was on ciprofloxacin
   that was changed to ceftriaxone today.  In addition, CTH on [**8-21**] was
   negative and abdominal U/S on [**8-18**] that was negative for thrombosis.
   Most recent urine culture from [**8-20**] negative.  DVT less likely in

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy could be due to various causes such as uremia/acute renal failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or an infectious process including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or urinary tract infection (UTI). SBP is less likely because the patient had a diagnostic paracentesis yesterday with WBC 261, PMN 24%, although she was on ciprofloxacin that was changed to ceftriaxone today. Additionally, a computed tomography (CT) scan on 8/21 was negative and an abdominal ultrasound on 8/18 was negative for thrombosis. The most recent urine culture from 8/20 was negative. DVT is less likely in the setting of coagulopathy secondary to liver disease.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR): The patient has AF with RVR with relatively stable pressures"

   An NGT is visualized which is coiled multiple times within the
   stomach and its distal tip projects over the expected region of the
   antrum of
   the stomach. Since the prior study, there is increased retrocardiac
   density,
   likely representing atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   Slightly
   more prominent appearance to the pulmonary vessels including the region
   of the
   azygos vein may suggest some developing fluid overload. Clinical
   correlation
   is needed. CP angles remain sharply delineated.
   Liver u/s
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Slightly limited evaluation. However, apparently patent hepatic
   vasculature but with continued slow flow within the main portal vein.
   Previously described possible nonocclusive thrombus in the main portal
   vein
   wall is not seen on today's study.
   2. Diffuse echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis.
   3. Mild-to-moderate amount of ascites.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a MELD score of 32 due to EtOH cirrhosis. She has multiple complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. The patient was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which were initially unresponsive to lopressor but responded to diltiazem.

2. The patient had hypotension and bradycardia, likely related to the doses of diltiazem and lopressor.

3. The patient developed acute renal failure, with unclear etiology but possibly related to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1 or pre-renal azotemia. The patient has been receiving HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.

4. The patient had fever, raising concerns for an infectious process, especially given her worsening encephalopathy and risk of aspiration pneumonia.

5. The patient has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with a high MELD score and complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Transplant work-up has been completed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of liver failure and renal failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU and is critically ill. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), which was initially rate-controlled with diltiazem. However, she subsequently developed bradycardia and hypotension. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, arterial line placement, and administration of pressors, glucose, and calcium were initiated. The patient's condition improved, and she is now in normal sinus rhythm.

24-hour events include multiple blood cultures, nasal swab, ultrasound, and abdominal imaging. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), wheezing, shellfish-derived substances, and latex. She also has a history of anaphylaxis and rash.

Review of systems shows diarrhea, jaundice, and no pain. The patient appears comfortable. Flowsheet data indicates ongoing fluid resuscitation with IV fluids and blood products. Vital signs reveal hypotension and tachycardia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula. ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals scleral edema, harsh systolic murmur at the apex, diminished bowel sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes, elevated creatinine, low albumin, and abnormal electrolytes. Imaging studies"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with liver failure and renal failure. They have a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was rate-controlled with diltiazem. The patient experienced bradycardia and hypotension, leading to the placement of central and arterial lines, as well as the initiation of pressors, glucose, and calcium infusions. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/63 mmHg to 83/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is currently 35.3°C and has a history of jaundice. They are not in acute distress.

Physical examination reveals scleral edema, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds with a harsh systolic murmur at the apex, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with diminished bowel sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows that the patient responds to verbal stimuli but is not oriented to time and place, and motor tone assessment was not performed.

Lab results indicate elevated creatinine (Cr) levels of 3.2 and 3.4 mg/dL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels of 23.5% and 27.8%, leukopenia with white blood cell (WBC"

   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Differential includes uremia/ARF, CVA, portal vein
   thrombosis, DVT, GIB, or infectious process including SBP, HAP, or UTI.
   SBP less likely given that the patient had a diagnostic paracentesis
   yesterday with WBC 261, PMN 24%, although this was on ciprofloxacin
   that was changed to ceftriaxone today.  In addition, CTH on [**8-21**] was
   negative and abdominal U/S on [**8-18**] that was negative for thrombosis.
   Most recent urine culture from [**8-20**] negative.  DVT less likely in
   setting of coagulopathy secondary to liver disease.
   - Follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -  Continue midodrine, octreotide and SPA as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone as above
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with relatively stable pressures. Tolerating afib as
   long as normotensive. Has had multiple episodes of afib c rvr o/n but
   always normotensive.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80.
   - monitor vitals
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology although differential includes
   HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large amounts of
   stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to fluids.  ATN less
   likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension. The patient has
   received HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for two
   days with worsening renal function. Renal is following.
   - Follow renal recs, may require HD soon
   -renal has been unable to get urine for sediment [**1-27**] no urine output.
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide for HRS
   - Trend urine outputs, lytes q12h
   - will repeat renal ultrasound if renal function does not improve
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
   .
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process in conjunction with
   patient's worsening encephalopathy.  Given the patients AMS, she is
   also at high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
   - Infectious etiology work-up as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP for now pending cultures
   - Follow-up cultures
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
   Transplant work-up complete per floor team.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Follow-up liver recs if any
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   .
   # Anemia: Patient recieved 2 unit PRBC yesterday. Bumped appropriately.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ
   perfusion
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count stable during admission.
   Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration in setting
   of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed.  Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI, nadolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals.

Ms. [Known lastname 7930], a 69-year-old female with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices, has been admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient's condition includes renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, and hypotension (not shock).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as uremia/acute renal failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or an infectious process including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The etiology of the patient's acute renal failure is unclear, with possibilities including hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) versus pre-renal azotemia. Large amounts of stool output suggest HRS as the more likely cause, and the patient has not responded to fluids.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7930**], a 69-year-old female with a MELD score of 32 due to EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices, was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, altered mental status, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hematochezia, and gastroparesis. The patient's condition has been managed with various medications and interventions, including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, albumin, ceftriaxone, and others. Her renal function has been deteriorating despite treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): HRS is a form of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It can be caused by complications of portal hypertension, like splenic sequestration or low cardiac output. In this case, the patient's worsening renal function despite fluid resuscitation raises concern for HRS type 1. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration for hemodialysis may be necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and worsening encephalopathy raise suspicion for an"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   69 year old female with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Differential includes uremia/ARF, CVA, portal vein
   thrombosis, DVT, GIB, or infectious process including SBP, HAP, or UTI.
   SBP less likely given that the patient had a diagnostic paracentesis
   yesterday with WBC 261, PMN 24%, although this was on ciprofloxacin
   that was changed to ceftriaxone today.  In addition, CTH on [**8-21**] was
   negative and abdominal U/S on [**8-18**] that was negative for thrombosis.
   Most recent urine culture from [**8-20**] negative.  DVT less likely in
   setting of coagulopathy secondary to liver disease.
   - Follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -  Continue midodrine, octreotide and SPA as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone (Day 3) as above, possible SBP
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with relatively stable pressures. Tolerating afib as
   long as normotensive. Has had multiple episodes of afib c rvr o/n but
   always normotensive.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80.
   - monitor vitals
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology although differential includes
   HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large amounts of
   stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to fluids.  ATN less
   likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension. The patient has
   received HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for two
   days with worsening renal function. Renal is following.
   - Follow renal recs, may require HD soon
   -renal has been unable to get urine for sediment [**1-27**] no urine output.
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide for HRS
   - Trend urine outputs, lytes q12h
   - will repeat renal ultrasound if renal function does not improve
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
 now changed to sevalemer
   .
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process in conjunction with
   patient's worsening encephalopathy.  Given the patients AMS, she is
   also at high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
   - Infectious etiology work-up as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP for now pending cultures
   - Follow-up cultures
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
   Transplant work-up complete per floor team.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Follow-up liver recs if any
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   .
   # Anemia: Patient recieved 2 unit PRBC yesterday. Bumped appropriately.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ
   perfusion
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count stable during admission.
   Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration in setting
   of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed.  Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI, nadolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals.
   - high residuals, TF held for now
   - will try upright positioning to help motility
   - KUB WNL

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of MELD 32 EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, and hypotension (not in shock). The differential diagnosis for her encephalopathy includes uremia/acute renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or an infectious process such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or urinary tract infection.

The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), ceftriaxone for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The plan is to continue these treatments and monitor vital signs, follow-up cultures, renal recommendations, liver recommendations, and electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can lead to altered mental status and potentially progress to coma if not properly managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with liver failure and likely hepatorenal syndrome. She is currently experiencing hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, followed by tachycardia. The patient is also encephalopathic and has not been able to provide her medical history.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), a current temperature of 35.9 C (96.6 F), a heart rate of 58 bpm with a range of 49-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/54 mmHg to 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 9-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus bradycardia.

The patient has undergone a transthoracic echo, which revealed findings of tricuspid regurgitation and aortic insufficiency. Additionally, the patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, wheezing, shellfish, latex, and anaphylaxis. She is currently on several medications, including ceftriaxone for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), midodrine, octreotide, albumin, lactulose, rifaximin, nadalol, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient's lab results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T, high potassium levels, low calcium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures have been collected on multiple occasions.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of encephalopathy and liver failure, treatment for hypotension and atrial fibrillation, addressing acute renal failure, monitoring and treating anemia, managing gastroparesis, providing prophylactic measures against deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ensuring glycemic control. The patient is expected to start renal replacement therapy (RRT) soon and will also undergo a renal ultrasound to rule out any obstruction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening encephalopathy, further deterioration in renal function, development of infections due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines, and complications related to the ongoing management of atrial fibrillation and hypertension."

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, presenting with hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure followed by tachycardia. She continues to be encephalopathic and is on lactulose and ceftriaxone. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is currently in sinus bradycardia. She also has acute renal failure, for which midodrine, octreotide, and albumin are being administered. Her renal function is worsening. She has anemia that is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome worsening, leading to further renal dysfunction.
2. Development of infections due to the use of indwelling lines and tubes.
3. Progression of encephalopathy, potentially leading to worsening cognitive function.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or bradycardia, which may require intervention.
5. Bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants like ceftriaxone.
6. Malnutrition or poor nutritional status due to the inability to tolerate oral intake.
7. Development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors.
9. Nosocomial pneumonia or ventilator-associated"

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, and hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response followed by tachycardia. She continues to be encephalopathic and requires ongoing medical management. Her current medications include lactulose, ceftriaxone (for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), rifaximin, nadalol, and a proton pump inhibitor. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg and a heart rate of 58 bpm. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but she has low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient has been experiencing episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight. 

The plan includes restarting lactulose for encephalopathy, continuing ceftriaxone, rifaximin, and other current medications. The patient will be presented at a transplant conference today.

   69 year old female with MELD 40 (as of [**2149-8-26**]) EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II
   varices transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.
   Approved for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide and SPA as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone (Day 4) as above, possible SBP
   - Guaiac stools
   # ESLD: Patient with MELD 40 cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**].  However, liver reported from
   the transplant meeting that she has never had a documented mammogram,
   and she will need breast cancer screening before a transplant will be
   approved by insurance.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   - Trend LFTs, coags
   - Address issue of breast cancer screening
 patient currently
   incapable of going for mammogram, will consider possibility of breast
   US following manual exam.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology although differential includes
   HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large amounts of
   stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to fluids. ATN less
   likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension. The patient has
   received HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for three
   days with worsening renal function. Renal is following.  Persistently
   acidemic yesterday - given 4 amps bicarb to stabilize.  Creatinine
   worsening.
   -Continue to follow renal recs
   - Renal ultrasound [**2149-8-26**] showed no signs of obstructive pathology.
   -Plan for IR-placed temporary dialysis catheter today, followed by
   initiation of HD.
   -FFP to be given before procedure.
   -renal has been unable to get urine for sediment [**1-27**] no urine output.
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide for HRS
   - Trend urine outputs, lytes q12h
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
 now changed to sevalemer.
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile yesterday, but still concerned for possible
   infection.
   - Infectious etiology work-up as above
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP for now pending cultures
   .# Afib with RVR: with relatively stable pressures. Tolerating afib as
   long as normotensive. Normotensive yesterday, no hypotensive episodes.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80.
   - monitor vitals
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable, following CBC closely.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ
   perfusion
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed. Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI, nadolol
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals.

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, who presented with hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure, followed by tachycardia. She has encephalopathy/liver failure and is being listed for a transplant. She also needs breast cancer screening as part of the workup. The patient's hypotension/afib/bradycardia is stable, but she has a fever. She has acute renal failure and will undergo hemodialysis (HD) with a new HD line. She will receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) pre-procedure and be given midodrine and octreotide. The patient's anemia is stable, and she is on prophylaxis for pneumoboots and PPI for stress ulcers. The remainder of the issues are being managed by the ICU team. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines inserted for monitoring and treatment. She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   -Liver recommended being more aggressive with tube feeds; Reglan QID;
   follow residuals closely; this afternoon, no residuals. Tube feeds
   restarted at 5pm. Held with GI bleed.
   -Repeat afternoon labs stable- platelets stable at 42. Still with
   metabolic acidosis and increasing gap to 21 (from 16); gave 50meq
   Bicarb at 6pm and drew ABG:
   -As per liver, increased midodrine and octreotide; OK to do breast exam
   and U/S appropriate areas for now as too unstable for diagnostic
   mammogram at this time.  Need to complete tomorrow AM so can get on
   liver transplant list.
   -at midnight, started having LGIB and UGIB, dropped sats, acidotic.
   Intubated. INR 2.9. Given FFP and blood. Hct 26.8, immediately after 1
   unit PRBC was 27.8 (but must factor in fact that little time to
   equilibrate and also receiving fluids/FFP so dilutional). Repeat Hct

   69 year old female with MELD 40 (as of [**2149-8-26**]) EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II
   varices transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.
   Approved for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**].
   .
   #GI Bleed: Hct is 29 s/p 2 units PRBC; also s/p FFP (INR 2.9-->2.3).
   Has been hemodynamically stable, No major drops in Hct. GI did not feel
   emergent need for scope. Will most likely not do repeat scope if
   remains stable. EGD on [**2149-8-22**] showed portal hypertensive gastropathy
   and esophageal varices. Has not been on nadolol prophylaxis [**1-27**] unable
   to tolerate with BP.
   - trend Q8 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   -restart nadolol as tolerated
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and cross
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for acidosis and low oxygen
   sats. Will look for improvement with HD.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated
   -continue to follow ABGs
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide and SPA as above
   - Stop ceftriaxone (Day 5); will confirm with liver that patients with
   PMN<250 or not growing unusual organism do not require 10 day course of
   treatment
   - Guaiac stools
   # ESLD: Patient with MELD 40 cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**].  However, liver reported from
   the transplant meeting that she has never had a documented mammogram,
   and she will need breast cancer screening before a transplant will be
   approved by insurance.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   - Trend LFTs, coags s/p FFP
   - Had breast exam yesterday, for diagnostic ultrasound today- needs
   this evaluation before final approval for transplant
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology although differential includes
   HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large amounts of
   stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to fluids. ATN less
   likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension. The patient has
   received HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin for four
   days with worsening renal function. Renal is following.  Persistently
   acidemic yesterday - given 4 amps bicarb to stabilize. Bicarb is 20.
   Creatinine worsening. Had IR placed line yesterday. For HD today.
   -will give additional bicarb if worsening respiratory function
   -Continue to follow renal recs
   - Renal ultrasound [**2149-8-26**] showed no signs of obstructive pathology.
   -renal has been unable to get urine for sediment [**1-27**] no urine output.
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide for HRS
   - Trend urine outputs, lytes q12h
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
 now changed to sevalemer.
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile x 2 days, but still concerned for possible infection.
   Has completed 5 days of ceftriaxone and no indication for further
   continuation.
   - Infectious etiology work-up as above
   - follow cultures closely
   .# Afib with RVR: with relatively stable pressures. Tolerating afib as
   long as normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80.
   - monitor vitals
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed. Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI
   -nadolol d/c
ed [**1-27**] hypotension and bradycardia; will add back when
   stable, especially in light of GI bleed
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals. Yesterday
   received tube feeds in evening b/c residuals low; however, tube feeds
   stopped when GI bleed
   - TF held for now pending resolution of GI bleed
   - standing reglan
   - will try upright positioning to help motility

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is approved for a liver transplant but requires a mammogram evaluation before final approval. The patient's current issues include GI bleed, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, ESLD, acute renal failure, fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension/bradycardia, thrombocytopenia, hematochezia, and gastroparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and ESLD, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and confusion.
2. GI Bleed: The patient has experienced a GI bleed, likely due to esophageal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy. This can result in hypotension and anemia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for acidosis and low oxygen saturation. Respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia or fluid overload.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or pre-renal azotemia."

   -Had line placement by IR late this afternoon, s/p 2 units FFP and
   DDAVP
   -For HD tomorrow AM
   -Liver recommended being more aggressive with tube feeds; Reglan QID;
   follow residuals closely; this afternoon, no residuals. Tube feeds
   restarted at 5pm. Held with GI bleed.
   -Repeat afternoon labs stable- platelets stable at 42. Still with
   metabolic acidosis and increasing gap to 21 (from 16); gave 50meq
   Bicarb at 6pm and drew ABG:
   -As per liver, increased midodrine and octreotide; OK to do breast exam
   and U/S appropriate areas for now as too unstable for diagnostic
   mammogram at this time.  Need to complete tomorrow AM so can get on
   liver transplant list.
   -at midnight, started having LGIB and UGIB, dropped sats, acidotic.
   Intubated. INR 2.9. Given FFP and blood. Hct 26.8, immediately after 1
   unit PRBC was 27.8 (but must factor in fact that little time to
   equilibrate and also receiving fluids/FFP so dilutional). Repeat Hct
   drawn this AM. Liver fellow came by. Since BP's stable in 120's to
   130's systolic, and Hcts not dramatically worsened, no indication to
   emergently scope.
   -Breast exam done. ?lipoma in left breast. Getting ultrasound of four

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis and a MELD score of 40. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including altered mental status, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, respiratory failure, and ESLD. She has also shown signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and acidosis. This could lead to further deterioration in kidney function and the need for renal replacement therapy.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, as indicated by abnormal liver enzymes and decreased albumin levels. This could lead to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to low oxygen saturation and acidosis. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to underlying lung pathology.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be secondary to esophageal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy. Continued monitoring and potential endoscopy may be required to assess and manage the source of bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, likely secondary to"

   -Had line placement by IR late this afternoon, s/p 2 units FFP and
   DDAVP
   -For HD tomorrow AM
   -Liver recommended being more aggressive with tube feeds; Reglan QID;
   follow residuals closely; this afternoon, no residuals. Tube feeds
   restarted at 5pm. Held with GI bleed.
   -Repeat afternoon labs stable- platelets stable at 42. Still with
   metabolic acidosis and increasing gap to 21 (from 16); gave 50meq
   Bicarb at 6pm and drew ABG:
   -As per liver, increased midodrine and octreotide; OK to do breast exam
   and U/S appropriate areas for now as too unstable for diagnostic
   mammogram at this time.  Need to complete tomorrow AM so can get on
   liver transplant list.
   -at midnight, started having LGIB and UGIB, dropped sats, acidotic.
   Intubated. INR 2.9. Given FFP and blood. Hct 26.8, immediately after 1
   unit PRBC was 27.8 (but must factor in fact that little time to
   equilibrate and also receiving fluids/FFP so dilutional). Repeat Hct
   drawn this AM. Liver fellow came by. Since BP's stable in 120's to
   130's systolic, and Hcts not dramatically worsened, no indication to
   emergently scope.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient's MELD score is 40, and she has been approved for a liver transplant. However, she requires breast cancer screening before the transplant can be approved by insurance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and her hematocrit levels have been stable. She has received blood transfusions and has been started on nadolol prophylaxis. Monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss is essential.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to low oxygen saturation and acidosis. There is a suspicion of pneumonia based on the chest X-ray findings. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, ABGs, and weaning from mechanical ventilation will be necessary.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy, possibly combined with uremia. Monitoring her mental status and following up on cultures are crucial. Treatment includes lactulose, rifaximin, and monitoring electrolytes.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an unclear etiology. It could be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), pre-renal az"

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, who presented with hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload, followed by tachycardia. She experienced a gastrointestinal bleed likely from varices, which has been stopped with fresh frozen plasma overnight. The patient also has respiratory failure, with desaturation due to volume overload and possible aspiration. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient is being listed for a liver transplant, and a liver ultrasound will be performed today. She also has renal failure and will undergo hemodialysis today. The patient has had episodes of fever, and her antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Her anemia will be monitored, and she is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.0°C (96.8°F), a heart rate of 52 bpm, a blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula and endotracheal tube with ventilator support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She has been transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated for acidosis and low oxygen saturation, with suspected pneumonia on chest X-ray. She has been approved for transplant but may not be a candidate due to her respiratory/renal/infectious status. The patient has several medical complications including GI bleed/coagulopathy, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, elevated lactate/hypothermia, ESLD, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, thrombocytopenia, hematochezia, gastroparesis, hypernatremia, and vaginal yeast infection. The patient is receiving various treatments and medications, and her condition is being closely monitored."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for transplant but may not be a candidate due to her respiratory/renal/infectious status. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hematochezia, gastroparesis, hypernatremia, and a vaginal yeast infection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has had several episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, and her renal function is worsening despite treatment for hepatorenal syndrome. She also has thrombocytopenia and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acidosis and low oxygen saturation. There is a concern for possible pneumonia on the chest X-ray. Close monitoring of ABGs and weaning of ventilator settings as tolerated is necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with worsening renal function despite treatment for hepatorenal syndrome. She requires hemodialysis to manage"

The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. She has a history of sulfa allergy, wheezing, shellfish-derived anaphylaxis, latex allergy, and rash. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note.

24-hour events include blood cultures taken at [2149-8-28] 10:30 AM and 10:35 AM, stool culture taken at 10:45 AM, sputum culture taken at 11:00 AM, and an ultrasound performed at 01:00 PM. The breast ultrasound showed no concerning breast mass. The patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened from ceftriaxone to cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin due to suspected pneumonia based on chest X-ray results. Dic labs were obtained, and the patient was given [Last Name (LF)] and [First Name3 (LF) 116] for further evaluation. Urine culture is pending, as well as upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. The patient was also started on free water per renal support. A family meeting with the liver team is planned for tomorrow. Additionally, the patient is experiencing oozing blood from the vagina after applying miconazole cream.

Allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), wheezing from shellfish-derived allergens, anaphylaxis from shellfish"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis who presented with encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She has been transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia as indicated by the chest X-ray. She also has acute renal failure, hypotension, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is awaiting a liver transplant but may not be a candidate due to her current respiratory/renal/?infectious status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can worsen her altered mental status.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections such as pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and bloodstream infections due to her immunocompromised state and invasive procedures.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of varices, which can lead to bleeding and potentially require emergent endoscopy.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome (HRS): Given her severe liver disease and renal dysfunction, she may develop HRS, which is a form of acute kidney injury seen in advanced liver disease.
5. Hepatic hydrothorax: This refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and has been approved for transplant. However, her overall status has been worsening.

Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed/Coagulopathy: The patient continues to have a declining hemoglobin level, indicating ongoing bleeding. She has diffuse bruising and bleeding, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Labs have been drawn to assess for DIC, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of significant blood loss or hemodynamic instability. A repeat endoscopy is not planned at this time.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for acidosis and low oxygen saturation levels. There is suspicion of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, and the patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored. Current ventilator settings are being maintained, and weaning is being done as tolerated.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and uremia. Infectious component is also possible but unclear. Treatment includes lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. Ceftriaxone has been stopped as there is no further indication for the treatment of"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], but now intubated, overall status
   worsening.
   .
   #GI Bleed/Coagulopathy: HCT continues to trend down slowly
 24.9 this
   morning.  Has been hemodynamically stable, No major drops in Hct. GI
   did not feel emergent need for scope. Will most likely not do repeat
   scope if remains stable.   Now with diffuse bruising and bleeding
 DIC
   labs drawn.
   - trend Q8 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   -restarted nadolol yesterday with holding parameters
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   -no further FFP for coagulopathy
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for acidosis and low oxygen
   sats. ? pneumonia on CXR. Will look for improvement with HD.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated
   -continue to follow ABGs
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide and SPA as above
   - Stop ceftriaxone - will confirm with liver that patients with PMN<250
   or not growing unusual organism do not require 10 day course of
   treatment
   - Guaiac stools
   .
    # Elevated lactate/Hypothermia- Concern for infection, unclear source,
   but possibly [**1-27**] infiltrate on CXR; Stopping ceftriaxone today as no
   further indication for SBP treatment; had been febrile 2 days ago
   -cdiff and cultures
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day 2)
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**].  Breast US showed no evidence
   of suspicious masses, though this is admittedly a sub-optimal screening
   test.  Likely will not be candidate for transplant in light of tenous
   respiratory/renal/?infectious status
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend LFTs, coags s/p FFP
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving dialysis.  Failure differential
   includes HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large
   amounts of stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to
   fluids. ATN less likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension.
   The patient has been receiving HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide,
   and albumin with worsening renal function. Renal is following.
   -Continue to follow renal recs
   - Renal ultrasound [**2149-8-26**] showed no signs of obstructive pathology.
   - very small amount of urine collected yesterday
 sent for culture.
   - Continue albumin, midodrine, octreotide for HRS
   - Trend lytes q12h
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
 now changed to sevalemer.
   .
   .# Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80.
   - monitor vitals
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
   - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed. Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI
   - nadolol restarted with holding parameters yesterday.
   .
   # Gastroparesis: Cont reglan prn if increased residuals.
   - TF held pending resolution of GI bleed-will restart slowly; will give
   free water flushes in light of hypernatremia to 150
   - standing reglan
   - will try upright positioning to help motility
   #hypernatremia: start 250 q 4 of free water
   .
   # vaginal yeast infection: miconazole
   .
   #FEN: TF, replete as necessary

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with multiple medical complications including liver failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) for renal failure and is being listed for a liver transplant due to encephalopathy/liver failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition occurs when the liver fails to function properly and causes kidney dysfunction. The patient is already on hemodialysis for renal failure, indicating that this complication is present.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support her breathing. The note mentions that there are doubts about her ability to control her airway if extubated, indicating that respiratory failure is a concern.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had vaginal bleeding and oozing from line sites yesterday, and the fibrinogen level is mentioned as 66. Cryo has been given. This suggests that there may be ongoing bleeding or a risk of further bleeding.

4. Infections: Blood cultures, stool culture, sputum culture, and urine culture have been ordered, indicating a suspicion of infection. The patient is also on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, which are antibiotics used to treat serious infections.

5. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) levels have been drifting"

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for transplant, but her overall status is worsening. She is intubated due to respiratory failure and has been hemodynamically stable with no major drops in Hct. The patient is now showing signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), indicated by diffuse bruising and bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is receiving dialysis, and there was a consideration of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia. Renal function is being closely monitored.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and uremia, with possible infectious component. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of liver cirrhosis.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has severe cirrhosis and is approved for transplant. Liver function abnormalities are being closely monitored.
4. Hypotension: The patient sometimes experiences hypotension, which is being managed with gentle boluses. The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing with a heart rate above 80 beats per minute.

   includes HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large
   amounts of stool output, more likely HRS as has not responded to
   fluids. ATN less likely as patient has not had episodes of hypotension.
   The patient has been receiving HRS therapy with midodrine, octreotide,
   and albumin with worsening renal function. Renal is following.
   -Continue to follow renal recs
   - Renal ultrasound [**2149-8-26**] showed no signs of obstructive pathology.

   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80. Will also be mindful of hemodynamic instability in
   setting of GI bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated for acidosis and low oxygen saturation, suspected pneumonia on CXR, and has been afebrile with no clear source of infection. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely hepatic-related, and is receiving dialysis. The patient's liver function abnormalities are likely due to ESLD. She has been approved for transplant and has a place on the transplant list. 

The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to GI bleed/DIC, and has received cryo and FFP. There is concern for an infectious component, possibly a lung infiltrate on CXR. The patient's thrombocytopenia is secondary to splenic sequestration in ESLD. She has hematochezia likely from internal hemorrhoids or rectal variceal bleed. The patient has gastroparesis and is on tube feeds. She has a vaginal yeast infection, which is being treated with miconazole. The patient's family is receiving regular updates and is very involved in her care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient is already receiving dialysis, and there is a concern for hepatorenal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated for an inability to protect airway and low oxygen saturation. She has been approved for transplant and is on the transplant list. She is receiving dialysis and various medications including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, albumin, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and sevelamer. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and hematochezia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is already receiving dialysis, indicating acute renal failure. It is important to monitor renal function and follow up on any changes in electrolyte levels.
2. Liver Failure: The patient has severe cirrhosis and is experiencing complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. Close monitoring of liver function and following recommendations for liver support are necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may be due to varice"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices.
- She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and has been intubated for respiratory failure and inability to protect the airway.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenia, hematochezia, gastroparesis, and a vaginal yeast infection.
- She has been receiving various treatments including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, albumin, dialysis, and prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 108/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal limits.
- Laboratory results show abnormalities in renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation profile.
- Imaging studies reveal a feeding tube tip in the proximal duodenum, enlarged heart, bilateral pleural effusions, and hazy vasculature consistent with fluid overload.

   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], but now intubated, overall status
   worsening.
   .
   #GI Bleed/DIC: s/p 1 unit cryo, 1 unit FFP. HCT remains stable.  Has
   been hemodynamically stable, No major drops in Hct. Now with diffuse
   bruising and bleeding, in DIC.
   - trend Q8 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   -give cryo for fibrinogen <125
   -restarted nadolol with holding parameters
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for inability to protect airway
   and low oxygen sats. ? pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**4-1**]) empirically for pneumonia
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue midodrine and SPA as above; octreotide discontinued as per
   hepatology (unlikely HRS)
   .
   # Elevated lactate/Hypothermia- Concern for infection, unclear source,
   but possibly [**1-27**] infiltrate on CXR
   -follow up on pending cultures
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day 4)
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**].  Breast US showed no evidence
   of suspicious masses, though this is admittedly a sub-optimal screening
   test.  Now has a place on transplant list.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, midodrine, octreotide, and albumin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend LFTs, coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo
   until reach that goal)
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving dialysis.  Failure differential
   included HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large
   amounts of stool output vs. ATN. The patient had been receiving HRS
   therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin with worsening renal
   function. Octreotide discontinued, as felt to be an ATN etiology. Renal
   is following.
   -Continue to follow renal recs
   - Renal ultrasound [**2149-8-26**] showed no signs of obstructive pathology.
   - Continue midodrine only
   - Trend lytes q12h
   -started on phoslo for elev phos
 now changed to sevalemer.
   .
   .# Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80. Will also be mindful of hemodynamic instability in
   setting of GI bleed.
    - monitor vitals
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets
   .
   # Hematochezia: Likely secondary to either internal hemorrhoids or
   rectal variceal bleed. Hematocrit has been stable and without further
   evidence of bleeding.
   - Trend hct as above
   - Continue PPI
   - nadolol restarted with holding parameters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated due to the inability to protect her airway and low oxygen saturation. She has been hemodynamically stable with no major drops in hematocrit. The patient's conditions include renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, hypotension (not in shock), and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed/DIC: The patient has diffuse bruising and bleeding, indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This condition can lead to further bleeding and clotting issues.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of pneumonia due to the presence of a fever and infiltrate on the chest X-ray.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and uremia. This can affect her level of consciousness and cognitive function.
4. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has severe cirrhosis with complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She remains sedated on low levels of propafol with good stool output on
   lactulose therapy. Her mental status ( off sedation) still precludes
   extubation but we will transition to CPAP/ PSV today provided
   secretions are not a major issue. HD to continue and she is tolerating
   tube feeds well. She has not needed massive transfusion for ongoing GI
   blood loss more attributable to low grade DIC.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis and multiple complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is now intubated due to an inability to protect her airway and low oxygen saturation levels. The patient has been approved for a liver transplant but her overall status has been worsening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is currently receiving dialysis, indicating acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1, pre-renal azotemia, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and the patient should continue to receive recommended renal care.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is likely a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and uremia. Infection may also be a contributing factor. Monitoring cultures and continuing lactulose and rifaximin therapy is essential.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has severe cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. She has been approved for a liver transplant, and close follow-up with hepatology recommendations is advised.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia"

   note yesterday reports #1 on OLT.
   24 Hour Events:
   -GI says less likely HRS as nminimal ascites. they will consider d/c
   midodrine tomorrow. They would also like a cardiology consult to
   optimize preoperative status (?what can we do to minimize operative
   risks re afib)
   -renal recs: no HD today, perhaps HD tomorrow, more likely tuesday
   -still oozing from gums
   -got 1U cryo for fibrinogen of 109. goal 125. should recheck tomorrow
   -surgery left note recommending cards consult pre-op.  Also mentioned
   #1 on list?  Need to follow this up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications, including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is approved for a liver transplant. The patient underwent an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) yesterday.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: Intubated for acidosis and low oxygen saturation, possible pneumonia on chest X-ray.
- Renal failure: Acute renal failure with plans for dialysis. The cause is uncertain but may be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1 or pre-renal azotemia.
- Encephalopathy: Combination of hepatic encephalopathy and uremia, with possible infectious component.
- Liver function abnormalities: Severe cirrhosis with associated complications.
- Hypotension: Tolerating atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response as long as blood pressures remain stable.
- Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during admission.
- Gastroparesis: On tube feeds with Dopamine.
- Possible vaginal yeast infection.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She will need to have much improved mentation to allow us safe attempts
   at extubation. NH3 level to be tracked with lactulose therapy. There
   are no concerns for ongoing GI blood loss at this time and tube feeds
   have been advanced without difficulty. She will need continued HD per
   Renal recs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and is currently intubated.

24-Hour Events:
- The GI team is considering discontinuing midodrine, a medication used for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), as the patient has minimal ascites. They also want a cardiology consult to optimize preoperative status, possibly to address atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR).
- Renal recommendations include no hemodialysis (HD) today, possibly tomorrow, but more likely on Tuesday. The patient continues to have oozing from her gums, and her fibrinogen levels are being monitored with cryoprecipitate administration.
- The surgery team recommended a cardiology consult preoperatively and mentioned that the patient may have a place on the transplant list.
- The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her respiratory system compliance is 31.3 cmH2O/mL, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

Physical Examination:
The patient is sedated and minimally responsive. She has persistent bruising and edema of the neck, moderate air movement bilaterally, mild rales bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with no audible murmurs, soft and non-distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and 1+ pedal edema.

Laboratory Results:
The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 48,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 45 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 3.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 136 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 3.3 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) level of 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 25 mEq/L, glucose level of 123 mg/dL, liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT"

   optimize preoperative status (?what can we do to minimize operative
   risks re afib)
   -renal recs: no HD today, perhaps HD tomorrow, more likely tuesday

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for a liver transplant and is currently intubated. Surgery notes indicate that the patient underwent an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) yesterday.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has been assessed, and it is less likely to be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) due to minimal ascites. Midodrine therapy may be discontinued tomorrow. A cardiology consult has been requested to optimize the patient's preoperative status, specifically regarding atrial fibrillation.
- Renal recommendations suggest that no hemodialysis (HD) will be performed today, possibly tomorrow, and more likely on Tuesday. The patient continues to ooze from her gums, and a cryoprecipitate transfusion was given for a fibrinogen level of 109, aiming for a goal of 125. The surgery team also recommended a cardiology consult preoperatively.
- The patient has allergies to sulfa, shellfish-derived products, and latex.
- The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient is receiving propofol infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/min.
- Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix).
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.
- The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being closely monitored.
- The patient's physical examination reveals persistent bruising and edema of the neck, moderate air movement bilaterally, mild rales bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, and 1+ pedal edema.
- Lab results indicate elevated potassium levels and altered liver function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and hypotension. The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, restarting nadolol with holding parameters, maintaining an active type and screen, and discussing the patient's exact place on the transplant list with hepatology. The patient's respiratory failure requires continued current vent settings and weaning as tolerated. Antibiotics have been started empirically for pneumonia. The patient's thrombocytopenia needs monitoring, and she may require platelet transfusion if her platelet count drops below 25,000. The patient's gastroparesis is being managed with tube feeds and upright positioning. Additionally, she has a vaginal yeast infection that is being treated with miconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. Continued monitoring and management with lactulose and rifaximin are necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring of renal function and ongoing communication with the renal team. Hemodialysis may be required based on further evaluation.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and the presence of grade II varices increase the risk of further bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and maintaining an active type and screen are important.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate levels and recent fever suggest the possibility of an infection. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be managed. These include:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and dialysis is being initiated. The cause of renal failure is uncertain, but it may be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring of renal function and electrolyte imbalances is ongoing.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and possibly an infectious component. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.

3. Liver failure: The patient has severe cirrhosis, and her liver function is abnormal. She has been approved for a liver transplant and is on the transplant list. Close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation parameters is necessary.

4. Hypotension and bradycardia: The patient sometimes experiences hypotension and bradycardia, particularly after breaking from atrial fibrillation. Gentle bolusing for hyp"

   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   .
   #GI Bleed: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 - received 1
   unit yesterday.  Has been hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse
   bruising and mild bleeding.  No major drops in Hct.
   -recd cryo again this am for fibrinogen of 104. continue to check daily
   fibrinogen
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol with holding parameters
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   -GI recommended DC-ing octreotide
   .
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently ? healthy enough
   for surgery.  Need to discuss with hepatology.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo until
   reach that goal). Got cryo this am
   - cards consult to evalute pre-op at their convenience
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for acidosis and low oxygen
   sats. ? pneumonia on CXR. Will look for improvement with HD.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM)
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**5-1**]) empirically for pneumonia. Give 500mg
   vanc after HD today
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -pt very sedated even off propofol x 5 hours
   .
   # Elevated lactate/Hypothermia- Concern for infection, unclear source,
   but possibly [**1-27**] infiltrate on CXR
   -lactate trended down
   -follow up on pending cultures
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day 5) empiric for hap
   -check vanc trough post HD and redose as appropriate
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving dialysis.  Likely [**1-27**] atn.
   Octreotide and midodrine discontinued, as felt to be an ATN etiology.
   Renal is following.
   -HD today
   -on sevelamer.
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - cards consult to evalute pre-op?
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80. Will also be mindful of hemodynamic instability in
   setting of GI bleed.
    - monitor vitals
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets
   .
   # Gastroparesis:
   - On tube feeds with Dopoff
   - will try upright positioning to help motility
   .
   # vaginal yeast infection: miconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of GI bleeding, respiratory failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and altered mental status. She is approved for transplant but currently not considered healthy enough for surgery. The patient's current conditions include renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, hypotension (not in shock), and thrombocytopenia. She is receiving dialysis, lactulose, rifaximin, cryo, FFP, vanc/cefepime/cipro (day 5), and propofol. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97%), heart rate 57 bpm, blood pressure 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver failure, characterized by changes in mental status and altered levels of consciousness.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to the need for dialysis.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and"

   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   .
   #GI Bleed: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 - received 1
   unit yesterday.  Has been hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse
   bruising and mild bleeding.  No major drops in Hct.
   - trend Q8 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   -restarted nadolol with holding parameters
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   -GI recommended DC-ing octreotide

   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**].    Now has a place on
   transplant list.  Need to discuss with hepatology to determine exact
   place on list.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo until
   reach that goal). Got cryo this am
   - cards consult to evalute pre-op?
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for acidosis and low oxygen
   sats. ? pneumonia on CXR. Will look for improvement with HD.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM)
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**5-1**]) empirically for pneumonia. Give 500mg
   vanc after HD today
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia.  Also possible infectious component, but she has been afebrile
   with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin

   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day 5) empiric for hap
   -check vanc trough post HD and redose as appropriate
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving dialysis.  Failure differential
   included HRS type 1 versus pre-renal azotemia in setting of large
   amounts of stool output vs. ATN. The patient had been receiving HRS
   therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin with worsening renal
   function. Octreotide discontinued, as felt to be an ATN etiology. Renal
   is following.
   -HD today
   -on sevelamer.

   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - cards consult to evalute pre-op?
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: sometimes goes into sinus brady after
   breaking from afib. have been bolusing gently for hypotension.
   Tolerating SPBs >80. Will also be mindful of hemodynamic instability in
   setting of GI bleed.
    - monitor vitals
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications. She has been admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and renal failure, and has also been approved for transplant. The patient is intubated, receiving dialysis, and has various medical conditions including altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, gastroparesis, and a vaginal yeast infection. She is currently being treated with multiple medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's severe cirrhosis and encephalopathy indicate a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and confusion.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is receiving dialysis. Acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and abnormal white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection are potential concerns.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's history of varices and the use of cryoprecipitate indicate a risk of GI bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and anemia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if there is concurrent GI bleeding or any procedure involving invasive lines or cath"

   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.  Need to discuss with
   hepatology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] further. Family not yet aware.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo until
   reach that goal).
   - cards consult to evalute pre-op at their convenience
   .
   #GI Bleed/DIC: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 - received 1
   unit yesterday.  Has been hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse
   bruising and mild bleeding, including rectally, vaginally, from lines,
   and from respiratory secretions.  No major drops in Hct.
   -fibrinogen >125 this AM, no need for cryo. continue to check daily
   fibrinogen
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol with holding parameters (has not been given in days [**1-27**] low
   BP's)
   -low platelets this morning, will give bag of platelets today
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's this AM. Not responsive to fluid
   boluses. Started on neo yesterday with good effect.
   -restart midodrine today, attempt to wean from neo.
   -sent blood cultures.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**6-1**]) empirically for pneumonia. dosing
   renally (vanco after HD)
   -will start fentanyl boluses for pain; on propofol
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -pt started waking up yesterday and biting on ET tube, grimacing, so
   propofol restarted. Also received 1mg morphine and started fentanyl
   boluses for pain.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving dialysis.  Likely [**1-27**] atn.
   -f/u renal recs and trend renal function
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes.
   - cards will see today
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets; now plt=29 and bleeding. will give bag of platelets
   today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated for airway protection and has a history of multiple complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, GI bleed/DIC, thrombocytopenia, lower extremity edema, and gastroparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's severe cirrhosis and encephalopathy indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen due to complications such as hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding episodes, especially with the presence of portal hypertension and varices.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's low platelet count and diffuse bruising suggest a possible coagulation disorder like DIC, which can lead to bleeding and clotting complications.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and fluid overload could predispose her to pulmonary edema, leading to shortness"

   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.  Need to discuss with
   hepatology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] further. Family not yet aware.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD

   #GI Bleed/DIC: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 - received 1
   unit yesterday.  Has been hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse
   bruising and mild bleeding, including rectally, vaginally, from lines,
   and from respiratory secretions.  No major drops in Hct.
   -fibrinogen >125 this AM, no need for cryo. continue to check daily
   fibrinogen
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol with holding parameters (has not been given in days [**1-27**] low

   boluses. Started on neo yesterday with good effect.
   -hypotension developed after HD
 will consider whether to switch to
   CVVH.

   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**6-1**]) empirically for pneumonia. dosing
   renally (vanco after HD)
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   -pt started waking up yesterday and biting on ET tube, grimacing, so
   propofol restarted. Also received 1mg morphine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for encephalopathy and renal failure. She has been approved for transplant but is currently inactivated from the transplant list due to her poor health condition. 

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation for airway protection. She has been sedated with propofol, but grimacing and biting the endotracheal tube prompted restarting propofol. Morphine was given due to nursing concerns about pain. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and lower extremity edema. 

Renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and the patient is receiving dialysis. There is a plan to transition to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) if needed. 

Hypotension has been present with low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and is not responsive to fluid boluses. Neo has been started with good effect, and midodrine will be restarted today to attempt weaning from neo. 

Respiratory failure is due to pneumonia on chest X-ray, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis who was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of GI bleeding, DIC, hypotension, ESLD, thrombocytopenia, gastroparesis, and a vaginal yeast infection. The patient is also on dialysis for acute renal failure and has a platelet count of 29. She has lower extremity edema and is at high risk of DVT. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is on multiple antibiotics empirically for pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines/catheters.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a low platelet count and a history of bleeding, which increases her risk of further bleeding episodes.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern about clearing secretions due to altered mental status.
4. Renal failure: The patient is receiving dialysis and may require further management for acute renal failure.
5. Liver failure: The patient has ESLD and is approved for transplant but currently inactivated from the list. She requires close monitoring of her liver function.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count"

   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   -Need to clarify with hepatology exactly what the plan is and the
   family
s awareness.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo until
   reach that goal), currently stable at 123-124, so will watch.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if OK for surgery
   .
   #GI Bleed/DIC: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse bruising and mild bleeding,
   including rectally, vaginally, from lines, and from respiratory
   secretions.  No major drops in Hct. Low platelets yesterday, gave one
   bag.
   -fibrinogen >125 this AM, no need for cryo. continue to check daily
   fibrinogen
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -low platelets this morning, will give bag of platelets today
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -restart midodrine today, attempt to wean from neo.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated for airway protection and on pressors due to hypotension. She has altered mental status, likely a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and sedation. The patient is also experiencing renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis. There are concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and thrombocytopenia. The patient has lower extremity edema and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, she has a vaginal yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of grade II varices, which can lead to bleeding. There is also mention of diffuse bruising and mild bleeding from various sites, indicating possible DIC.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's low platelet count, along with the presence of bleeding and bruising, suggests the possibility of DIC.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains low, which can contribute to bleeding complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome or sepsis. She is currently receiving hemodialysis.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and sedation. Infectious causes should also be considered.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver dysfunction, which is a result of her underlying severe cirrhosis. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels is necessary.

4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite being on vasopressor support. Midodrine has been restarted to manage her low blood pressure.

5. Diffuse Bruising and Bleeding: The patient exhibits signs of diffuse bruising and bleeding, including rectal bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and bleeding from lines and respiratory secretions. This suggests a coagulopathy, which may be due to disseminated intravascular co"

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   -Need to clarify with hepatology exactly what the plan is and the
   family
s awareness.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.  Will perform EGD
   if evidence of significant UGIB.
   - Trend coags s/p FFP, cryo; goal of fibrinogen 125 (give cryo until
   reach that goal), currently stable at 123-124, so will watch.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if OK for surgery
   .
   #GI Bleed/DIC: receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable, but with diffuse bruising and mild bleeding,
   including rectally, vaginally, from lines, and from respiratory
   secretions.  No major drops in Hct. Low platelets yesterday, gave one
   bag.
   -fibrinogen >125 this AM, no need for cryo. continue to check daily
   fibrinogen
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -low platelets this morning, will give bag of platelets today
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -continue midodrine, attempt to wean from neo. Will increase midodrine
   to 15mg TID tomorrow if still unsuccessful at weaning (hadn
t been
   getting midodrine yesterday bc of issues with NGT)
   -f/u cultures
   -will consider CVVH if still unable to wean pressors and
   renal/hepatology feel strongly about doing so. Still quite fluid
   overloaded despite hypotension.  Discuss with consultants to clarify
   plan.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -vanc/cefepime/cipro (day [**7-1**]) empirically for pneumonia. dosing
   renally (vanco after HD).  DC all antibiotics today.
   -fentanyl boluses for pain; on propofol
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving HD.  Likely [**1-27**] atn.
   -may need to transition to CVVH
   -f/u renal recs and trend renal function
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes. Has been in sinus
   rhythm.
   -will likely need right heart cath if goes for surgery
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets; now plt=28 and bleeding. will give bag of platelets
   today.
   .
   # vaginal yeast infection: miconazole
   .
   #FEN: TF; replete electrolytes as needed

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She has been transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes ESLD, GI bleed/DIC, hypotension, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, lower extremity edema, thrombocytopenia, and vaginal yeast infection.

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 110/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR), low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient's imaging reveals mild pulmonary edema, large cardiac silhouette, and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, vasopressors, dialysis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has a urinary catheter, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver dysfunction, further deterioration of renal function, development of sepsis due to infections, thromboembolic events, and complications related to mechanical ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies. Regular assessment of the patient's mental status and respiratory status is crucial. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored due to her hypotension and ongoing fluid overload. Frequent communication with the hepatology and nephrology teams is necessary to guide further management."

   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   -in setting of oozing, goal of fibrinogen 125, fibrinogen currently
   <100 but not bleeding so will not give more cryo for now pending d/w
   liver.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if otherwise OK for
   surgery
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now oozing improved
   -receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125
   -recd plts yesterday for plt <30, plt still low today. could consider
   transfusing more, but pt not currently bleeding
   -continue to trend coags and hct [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen (expires [**9-7**])
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -continue midodrine, attempt to wean from neo. Will increase midodrine
   to 15mg TID tomorrow if still unsuccessful at weaning (hadn
t been
   getting midodrine yesterday bc of issues with NGT)
   -f/u cultures
   -will consider CVVH if still unable to wean pressors and
   renal/hepatology feel strongly about doing so. Still quite fluid
   overloaded despite hypotension.  Discuss with consultants to clarify
   plan.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -on empiric abx for [**Last Name (LF) 1934**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] DC all antibiotics today.
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving HD.  Likely [**1-27**] atn.
   -may need to transition to CVVH
   -f/u renal recs and trend renal function
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes. Has been in sinus
   rhythm.
   -will likely need right heart cath if goes for surgery
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.
    - Trend platelets; now plt=28 and bleeding. will give bag of platelets
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 97/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and renal failure. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and lower extremity edema. She is currently receiving multiple medications and interventions including lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, vasopressin, hepatology consultation, and dialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma if not managed appropriately.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. This condition is characterized by decreased kidney function in the setting of liver disease. If left untreated, it can progress to"

   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   -in setting of oozing, goal of fibrinogen 125, fibrinogen currently
   <100 but not bleeding so will not give more cryo for now pending d/w
   liver.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if otherwise OK for
   surgery
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now oozing improved
   -receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125
   -recd plts yesterday for plt <30, plt still low today. could consider
   transfusing more, but pt not currently bleeding
   -continue to trend coags and hct [**Hospital1 **]

   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - trend Q12 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen (expires [**9-7**])
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -continue midodrine, attempt to wean from neo. Will increase midodrine
   to 15mg TID tomorrow if still unsuccessful at weaning (hadn
t been
   getting midodrine yesterday bc of issues with NGT)
   -f/u cultures
   -will consider CVVH if still unable to wean pressors and
   renal/hepatology feel strongly about doing so. Still quite fluid
   overloaded despite hypotension.  Discuss with consultants to clarify
   plan.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -on empiric abx for [**Last Name (LF) 1934**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] DC all antibiotics today.

   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin

   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes. Has been in sinus
   rhythm.
   -will likely need right heart cath if goes for surgery
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count remains low but stable during
   admission. Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to splenic sequestration
   in setting of portal hypertension and ESLD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, lower extremity edema, thrombocytopenia, and a vaginal yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output.
3. Hepatic hydrothorax: Given the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, there is a risk of hepatic hydrothorax, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's ascites increases the risk of SBP, an infection within the peritoneal cavity.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of varices, which can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and lower extremity edema put her"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure.  Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**], now intubated.
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   -in setting of oozing, goal of fibrinogen 125, fibrinogen currently
   <100 but not bleeding so will not give more cryo for now pending d/w
   liver.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if otherwise OK for
   surgery
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now oozing improved
   -receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 if actively bleeding (not
   bleeding this AM)
   -recd plts yesterday for plt <30, plt still low today. could consider
   transfusing more if starts oozing
   -continue to trend coags and hct [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - trend Q24 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen (expires [**9-7**])
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -will d/c midodrine b/c still requiring neo anyway
   -f/u cultures
   -will consider CVVH if still unable to wean pressors and
   renal/hepatology feel strongly about doing so. Still quite fluid
   overloaded despite hypotension.  Discuss with consultants to clarify
   plan.
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -on empiric abx for [**Last Name (LF) 1934**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] DC all antibiotics today.
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Now receiving HD.  Likely [**1-27**] atn.
   -may need to transition to CVVH
   -f/u renal recs and trend renal function
   .
   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes. Has been in sinus
   rhythm.
   -will likely need right heart cath if goes for surgery
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.
   .
   # vaginal yeast infection: miconazole
   .
   #FEN: TF; replete electrolytes as needed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. She has been approved for transplant but is currently not healthy enough for surgery. The patient is intubated due to airway protection and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, altered mental status, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis and can cause altered mental status and confusion.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremia.

3. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common complications in critically ill patients.

4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to her low platelet count and ongoing coagulopathy.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has lower extremity edema and is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.

6. Hepatic hydrothorax: This is a potential complication of cirrhosis where"

   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   -in setting of oozing, goal of fibrinogen 125, fibrinogen currently
   <100 but not bleeding so will not give more cryo for now pending d/w
   liver.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if otherwise OK for
   surgery
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now oozing improved
   -receiving cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125 if actively bleeding (not
   bleeding this AM)
   -recd plts yesterday for plt <30, plt still low today. could consider
   transfusing more if starts oozing
   -continue to trend coags and hct [**Hospital1 **]

   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - trend Q24 Hcts; Transfuse for Hct <25 or hemodynamic instability
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen (reordered for [**9-7**])
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt with MAPs in low 50's 2 days ago. Midodrine restarted,
   not able to wean her from neo.
   -will d/c midodrine b/c still requiring neo anyway
   -f/u cultures
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite fact that propofol off since this AM).  Minimal secretions
   overnight.
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
   -finished course of empiric abx for VAP.
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - continue to follow up on cultures
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin

   # Afib with RVR: with stable pressures. Tolerating afib as long as
   normotensive. Normotensive, no hypotensive episodes. Has been in sinus
   rhythm.
   -will likely need right heart cath if goes for surgery
   - If needed may use diltiazem, however use small dose 1-2mg IV, also
   consider let HR stay 130 as long as pressures stable
   .
   # Lower Extremity Edema: continue to follow. Consider LENIs if
   worsening as pt is at high risk of DVT. Pneumoboots on.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. She has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia, as well as a possible infectious component. The patient has been receiving hemodialysis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure. She also has a history of lower extremity edema, vaginal yeast infection, depression, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by cognitive dysfunction and altered levels of consciousness. This condition requires ongoing management with lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which is likely caused by hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) due to severe cirrhosis. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing hemodialysis are necessary.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient previously experienced oozing from multiple sites, indicating a possible DIC"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for transplant but is currently inactive due to her unstable condition. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 97/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

Her lab results show elevated total and free calcium levels, likely related to immobility. There is also an increase in fibrinogen levels from cryo administration. Her white blood cell count is within normal range, but platelet count is low. Liver function tests indicate abnormal liver function. Other lab results show normal glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, lower extremity edema, and a vaginal yeast infection. She is receiving various medications including lactulose, rifaximin, PPI, midodrine, and sedatives.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia on CXR. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Other medical conditions include altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity edema, vaginal yeast infection, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of severe cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition causes confusion, altered mental status, and can progress to coma if not managed properly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN. AKI can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Infection: The presence of pneumonia on CXR indicates a potential respiratory infection. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for other infections such as bloodstream infections, especially with the use of indwelling lines and catheters.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is now intubated with respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Liver failure: The note mentions ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) and the patient is being treated with midodrine, lactulose, and rifaximin.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) but has to slow down fluid removal due to hypotension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains encephalopathic and is being ventilated with current settings.
4. Hypotension: The patient needs more pressor support to facilitate fluid removal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a common complication of liver failure and can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Infections: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, she is at a higher risk of developing infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. GI bleeding: Given the patient's history of portal hypertensive gastropathy and grade II varices, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: This"

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient is listed for a liver transplant but has been deemed too sick for surgery.

24-hour events include the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and unstable blood pressures, which were managed with medication and fluid bolus. The patient also received a platelet transfusion and continues to receive cryoprecipitate for bleeding. There have been no new findings on cultures.

Assessment and plan:
1. ESLD: The patient's severe cirrhosis has led to complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. She was approved for transplant but is currently not healthy enough for surgery.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
   - Monitor liver function closely and follow recommended guidelines.

2. DIC: The patient had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the past, but is currently improved.
   - Continue cryoprecipitate administration if fibrinogen level is below 125 and there is evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor platelet levels and transfuse if low with evidence of bleeding.

3. LGIB: The patient had"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is approved for transplant but currently inactive on the transplant list due to her health condition. She has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, which is indicated by the need for continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).
2. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia. Sedation may also contribute to this condition.
3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has liver function abnormalities, which are common in patients with cirrhosis.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can be attributed to her underlying liver disease and portal hypertension.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, as indicated by low platelet count and prolonged coagulation times. She requires cryoprecipitate transfusion to maintain adequate fibrinogen levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently inactivated on the transplant list due to her poor health condition. 

24-hour events include the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was stabilized by increasing neo. The patient also received a 250cc bolus, after which she improved. No new liver or renal recommendations were made. 

The patient has allergies to sulfa, shellfish-derived substances, and latex. She received cefipime and ciprofloxacin on [**2149-9-4**]. 

Infusions include propofol at 10 mcg/Kg/min and phenylephrine at 1.2 mcg/Kg/min. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given on [**2149-9-6**] at 08:16 PM. 

Physical examination shows that the patient is intubated, minimally responsive to pain, and exhibits purposeless movements. Her lungs are clear, and she has a holosystolic murmur on the right side. The abdomen is soft and non-distended, with positive bowel sounds and peripheral edema. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low plate"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. The patient was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is currently inactivated from the transplant list due to not being healthy enough for surgery.

The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, and hypotension (not shock). The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's past medical history includes lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), for which nadolod was prescribed for variceal bleeding prophylaxis but was discontinued due to hypotension. The patient also has a history of possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), for which cryoprecipitate was given to maintain fibrinogen levels above 125 if actively bleeding. The patient's platelet count remains low, and more transfusions may be considered if the patient starts oozing.

The patient's respiratory status includes intubation for airway protection and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are plans to wean the ventilator settings as tolerated. The patient's mental status is likely a combination of hep"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently inactivated on the transplant list due to her poor health condition.

24-hour events include the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypertension, which required increasing the neo (presumably referring to a medication or treatment). The patient also experienced episodes of bleeding, and her fibrinogen levels were monitored and treated accordingly. Other interventions included transfusion of platelets, administration of lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, and continuation of renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's severe liver cirrhosis has led to encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and minimal responsiveness. Continued treatment with lactulose and rifaximin is recommended to manage this condition.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being used for renal replacement therapy. It is important to continue monitoring renal function and following recommended guidelines for managing this condition.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis who has been transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She is now intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of liver failure, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD), but it is difficult to remove fluid at the moment due to labile blood pressures. The patient is also being treated for GI bleed, respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has severe EtOH cirrhosis and is experiencing encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and potentially progress to coma if not managed properly.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen if not treated promptly and may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if proper lung hygiene measures are not followed.

4. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of portal hypertensive gastropathy and grade II varices, which increases the risk of GI bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and"

   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status (still very sedated
   despite being off propofol).
   -no plan for imminent extubation
   -continue to follow ABGs
 have been stable.
   -finished course of empiric abx for VAP.  Now off antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is also experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, and a recent vaginal yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to her underlying liver disease, pneumonia, or both. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring increased ventilatory support or even emergent surgical intervention.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely a result of her liver disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for ongoing renal replacement therapy.

3. Liver Failure: The patient's severe cirrhosis and encephalopathy indicate advanced liver failure. This can result in hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and an increased risk of variceal bleeding.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for liver transplantation but is currently inactive on the transplant list due to her poor health condition.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia on the chest X-ray. She is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 484 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support parameters are stable, with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 42.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Her renal recommendations include continuing CVVH, decreasing fluid removal, and running even today. Her renal function will be closely monitored.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy combined with uremia. This may also be accompanied by an infectious component. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for the encephalopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure and has pneumonia on CXR. She also has acute renal failure and is on CVVH. The patient has liver function abnormalities and is approved for transplant but currently inactive on the transplant list due to her unstable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient is experiencing hypotension that may be related to fluid removal during CVVH or potential septic shock. There is also a possibility of low blood pressure due to liver failure and abdominal distension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia on CXR. She will continue on current vent settings, with plans to wean as tolerated. It is unlikely that she will be able to clear secretions due to altered mental status.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH and will continue with this treatment. Renal function should be closely monitored, and recommendations regarding CVVH will be followed.
4. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has severe cirrhosis with complications such as ascites, encephalopathy"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for transplant but is currently inactive on the transplant list due to her poor health condition.

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding), SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), vaginal yeast infection, depression, and FEN (fluid and electrolyte imbalance).

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has been diagnosed with pneumonia on the chest X-ray. She requires ongoing ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 807 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 49, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 69 to 142 beats per minute, blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for a liver transplant but is currently inactive on the transplant list due to her poor health condition. She requires ongoing medical support and treatment for multiple complications related to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia on the chest X-ray. There is a concern about clearing secretions due to mental status impairment. Ventilator settings need to be monitored closely.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for acute renal failure. CVVH needs to be continued, and renal function should be closely monitored.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has severe cirrhosis with complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She is at risk for further liver deterioration and associated complications like hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Hypotension: The patient experiences episodes of hypotension, which may be due to fluid removal during CVVH or septic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate vasopressor support are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe alcohol-induced cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has been approved for transplant but is currently inactive on the transplant list due to her unstable medical condition.

The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation (AF), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and hypotension. She is intubated for airway protection and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient is also experiencing a yeast infection, depression, and a previous lower gastrointestinal bleed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient had several episodes of AF with rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures were attempted with Lopressor but were unsuccessful. Digoxin loading was started, and the patient eventually returned to sinus rhythm. The plan is to continue with the digoxin load and monitor the patient's response.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and possible pneumonia. Current ventilator settings will be continued, and weaning will be done as tolerated. No plan for imminent extubation has been made, and ABGs will be followed closely.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hem"

   24 Hour Events:
   -pt in afib c rates in 120s-140s s/p suctioning around 12:30pm. got
   250cc NS and 5 lopressor s effect. gave addl 5 lopressor x2 but still
   no change after 20 min. Gave addl 250cc ns and pt broke.
   -discussed possibility of dig loading or amio loading if recurrent
   trouble c afib. one concern c amio (or cardioversion) would be that she
   has been in and out of afib for days and is not anticoagulated.
   -no new recs from renal or hepatology
   -husband left before Dr [**Name (NI) 242**] could chat c him again
   -started running cvvh negative 50 cc at approx 1hr after converted out
   of afib. started at neg 50cc then bumped to 70cc neg.
   -went into afib again after being suctioned around 1am. gave lopressor

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis and complications including encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for encephalopathy and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, and her condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR), acute renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, hypotension (not shock), and possible components of septic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB/RVR): The patient experienced episodes of AFIB with rates in the 120s-140s. Rate control attempts with Lopressor were unsuccessful. Digoxin loading was started, but the patient remained in AFIB. The plan is to continue the digoxin load, monitor EKGs six hours after each dose, and consider right heart catheterization if the patient goes for surgery.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. Current ventilator settings will be continued, with plans to wean as tolerated. No plan for imminent extubation is mentioned.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous renal replacement"

   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**] now inactivated on transplant list
   [**1-27**] too sick
    .
   #Goals of Care: Family mtg yesterday, decided no more cvvh. slowly
   starting to withdraw care.
   -consider not checking daily labs
   -consider withdrawing some meds
   -consider extubate
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: Likely some component of too much fluid off with
   CVVH. Midodrine restarted, not able to wean her from neo.
   -still requiring neo, also on midodrine and vasopressin
   -f/u cultures
 no new results. Possibly does have some component of
   septic shock, but has been off antibiotics other than cipro now because
   finished full course for possible VAP
   -re-sent blood cultures on [**9-7**] and [**9-8**], both NGTD
   -possibly has some component of low BP from liver failure
    .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status
   -no plan for imminent extubation, could ask husband if he would like to
   try to extubate, though would not be able to reintubate if she failed
   -finished course of empiric abx for VAP.  Now off antibiotics other
   than cipro prophylaxis.
    .
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   -meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] yesterday, pt made DNR/DNI
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  discontinued cvvh today
   .
   # Afib with RVR: had several episodes of afib yesterday into the 140s.
   Tried to rate control c lopressor. First time broke with fluids. second
   time started dig load and eventually went back to sinus rhythm but
   again in afib this am.
   -dig load complete, no new dig ordered
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now improved.
   -today no oozing and fibrinogen of 103.
   -will stop monitoring fibrinogen as would not correct
   .
   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - will not transfuse, will stop monitoring daily hct
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Stop ordering type and screen (reordered this am)
   -continue cipro ppx for SBP
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - recent cultures ngtd.
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis and multiple complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. She has been approved for a transplant but is currently inactive on the transplant list due to her medical condition.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

The goals of care have been discussed with the family, and they have decided to withdraw care from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The plan is to start withdrawing care slowly and consider not checking daily labs, withdrawing some medications, and possibly extubating the patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient has been off antibiotics other than cipro now because she finished a full course for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There are plans to re-sent blood cultures on 9/7 and 9/8.

   #Goals of Care: Family mtg yesterday, decided no more cvvh. slowly
   starting to withdraw care.
   -consider not checking daily labs
   -consider withdrawing some meds
   -consider extubate
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: Likely some component of too much fluid off with
   CVVH. Midodrine restarted, not able to wean her from neo.
   -still requiring neo, also on midodrine; will try to add vasopressin
   and then try to get her negative c CVVH
   -f/u cultures
 no new results. Possibly does have some component of
   septic shock, but has been off antibiotics other than cipro now because
   finished full course for possible VAP
   -re-sent blood cultures on [**9-7**] and [**9-8**], both NGTD
   -possibly has some component of low BP from liver failure
    .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status
   -no plan for imminent extubation, could ask husband if he would like to
   try to extubate, though would not be able to reintubate if she failed
   -finished course of empiric abx for VAP.  Now off antibiotics other
   than cipro prophylaxis.

   -meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] yesterday, pt made DNR/DNI
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   - will continue to follow closely, give cryo if there is any evidence
   of bleeding.
   - cards consult to consider right heart cath if otherwise OK for
   surgery

   # Afib with RVR: had several episodes of afib yesterday into the 140s.
   Tried to rate control c lopressor. First time broke with fluids. second
   time started dig load and eventually went back to sinus rhythm but
   again in afib this am.
   -dig load complete, no new dig ordered
   -dig level 0.4 yesterday
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now improved.
   -today no oozing and fibrinogen of 103.
   -will stop monitoring as would not correct

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and possible septic shock. She has been approved for transplant but is currently too sick to proceed. The family has decided to withdraw care, including discontinuing CVVH, and will focus on comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection and possible pneumonia. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to mental status and inability to clear secretions.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure. Stopping CVVH when the filter is complete needs to be considered. Monitoring renal function and following renal recommendations are essential.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has severe cirrhosis with associated complications like encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and varices. Close monitoring of liver function and"

   69 year old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
   ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices
   transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. Approved
   for transplant at meeting on [**2149-8-26**] now inactivated on transplant list
   [**1-27**] too sick
    .
   #Goals of Care: Family mtg yesterday, decided no more cvvh. slowly
   starting to withdraw care.
   -continue daily discussions regarding GOC
   -not checking am labs
   -consider starting to withdraw meds
   -consider extubate
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: Likely some component of too much fluid off with
   CVVH. Midodrine restarted, not able to wean her from neo.
   -still requiring neo, also on midodrine and vasopressin
   -f/u cultures
 no new results. Possibly does have some component of
   septic shock, but has been off antibiotics other than cipro now because
   finished full course for possible VAP
   -re-sent blood cultures on [**9-7**] and [**9-8**], both NGTD
   -possibly has some component of low BP from liver failure
    .
   #Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for airway protection. ?
   pneumonia on CXR.
   -continue current vent settings, wean as tolerated; likely will not be
   able to clear secretions because of mental status
   -consider extubate, though would not be able to reintubate if she
   failed
   -finished course of empiric abx for VAP.  Now off antibiotics other
   than cipro prophylaxis.
    .
   # ESLD: Patient with severe cirrhosis complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Approved
   for transplant by committee as of [**2149-8-26**], currently inactivated from
   list as not healthy enough for surgery.
   -meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] yesterday, pt made DNR/DNI
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
   - Liver following closely, continue to follow recs.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  discontinued cvvh yesterday
   .
   # Afb with RVR: several episodes of afib yesterday, currently in afib
   -got dig yesterday
   -prefer to not continue dig as will not be checking levels
   .
   #DIC: several days ago was oozing from everywhere and she was receiving
   cryo to keep fibrinogen above 125. Now improved.
   -no longer monitoring
   .
   #s/p LGIB: Has been hemodynamiclly stable
   - will not transfuse, will stop monitoring daily hct
   - nadolol for vericeal bleeding ppx d/c'ed bc of hypotension
   -continue IV PPI
   -Stop ordering type and screen (reordered this am)
   -continue cipro ppx for SBP
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Likely combination of hepatic encephalopathy and
   uremia, in conjunction with sedation.  Also possible infectious
   component, but she has been afebrile with no clear source.
   - recent cultures ngtd.
   - Cont lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # vaginal/bottom yeast infection: miconazole
   #depression: holding citalopram for now in setting of somnolence.
   #FEN: continue tube feeds for now
    PPx: pneumoboots, PPI
    Access: IJ, temporary dialysis cath

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe EtOH cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and grade II varices. She was transferred to the MICU for encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient is approved for transplant but has been inactivated on the transplant list due to her current illness.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever of 102.0 F
- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response throughout the day
- Low pressures, not given lopressor or diltiazem
- Extra half dose of digoxin given since the level was 0.6
- Intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%
- Wound infection with yeast infection in the vaginal and bottom area
- Depression and holding citalopram for now due to somnolence
- Foley catheter in place
- NG tube in place
- Prolonged bed rest and immobility
- Malnutrition and poor nutritional status

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cirrhosis and encephalopathy makes her more susceptible to infections. The presence of fever, wound infection, and recent antibiotic use suggests the possibility of an ongoing or recurrent infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The"
