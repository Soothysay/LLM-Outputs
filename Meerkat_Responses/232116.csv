","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who was admitted with a left infected foot ulcer. She underwent debridement of the ulcer in the clinic today and was planned for an operation tomorrow. This evening, her blood pressure fell to the 70's/40's, but she remained asymptomatic. Intravenous fluids (IVF) were given, and her blood pressure increased to the 80's. She was given Vicodan and Ativan, but her blood pressure fell again. She was transferred for closer monitoring.

24-hour events include obtaining a history from the patient and housestaff, as well as noting any allergies or reactions to medications. The patient has multiple known allergies, including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, wool/alcohols, latex, and trimethoprim. The last dose of antibiotics was given, and the patient received various infusions and other ICU medications.

There were no significant changes to the patient's medical, social, or family history, except for the infected left foot ulcer and numbness/tingling in the neurologic review of systems.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Her temperature is 37.1Â°C, heart rate is 84 bpm, blood pressure is fluctuating between 107/49 and 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 59 y.o female with PMH HTN, HL, CAD, DM, hypothyroidism who
   presents with L.foot infection and hypotension.
   .
   #Hypotension-concerning for septic shock given known diabetic foot
   infection, and hypotension.  Patient taken to OR yesterday, and
   cultures sent from foot by podiatry.  Other etiologies include PNA,
   UTI, osteomyelitis. Patient has been ruled out for MI. She may have
   aspirated after being taken to the OR. CXR shows RUL opacity,
   concerning for pneumonia.
   -IVF for MAP >65
   -continue current abx vanco/cipro/flagyl for foot infection, until
   cultures are negative. Repeat UA negative
   -follow up blood cultures, UCx
   .
   #L.foot pain/infection-continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl for
   DM foot infection, covering for potential pseudomonas. Pain control
   with tramadol prn. Going back to OR today, per podiatry
   - f/u podiatry recs.
   -f/u culture data
   .
   # Altered mental status: After OR procedure yesterday patient was
   difficult to arouse, and not able to interact appropriately. A+Ox1
   only. Got minimal sedation during procedure. Patient was febrile
   yesterday, and seems to have worsening mental status with fevers.
   Clearing this morning, after getting tylenol. Neuro exam non focal.
   Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs. This is most likely altered mental status
   in the setting of fever and infection.
   -continue to monitor.
   .
   #acute renal failure. Cr 2.0 on transfer to ICU. Cr 1.0 this AM.
   Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of infection.
   -continue maintenance IV fluids, and boluses PRN MAP<60
   -redose Vanc and Zosyn
   .
   # Pulmonary edema seen on CXR: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to +1.6L fluid up over
   the last 24 hours. [**Month (only) 60**] have a component of cardiogenic shock vs. ARDS
   in the setting of overwhelming infection.
   -will obtain echo to eval cardiac function
   -supplemental oxygen as necessary

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient presents with hypotension and a known diabetic foot infection. This suggests the possibility of septic shock due to the infection.

2. Pneumonia: The CXR shows an opacity at the right lung apex, which could reflect a developing consolidation. This indicates a concern for pneumonia.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level was elevated on transfer to the ICU (Cr 2.0) but improved to 1.0 this morning. This suggests a possibility of acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of infection.

4. Pulmonary Edema: The CXR also shows signs of pulmonary edema, which could be secondary to fluid overload or cardiogenic shock.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had difficulty arousing and interacting appropriately after the OR procedure yesterday. This may be due to fever and infection causing altered mental status.

6. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has a history of CAD, HTN, and HL, which increases the risk of cardiac dysfunction.

7. Diabetic Foot Infection: The patient has an ongoing left foot infection that requires continued antibiotic coverage.

8. UTI/Aspiration: There is concern for UTI and possible aspiration after being taken to the OR.

9. Osteomyelitis: Other etiologies for the foot infection include oste"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presents with left foot infection and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 126/66 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient underwent a procedure in the operating room for wound debridement of her left foot infection. During the procedure, she received fluids and anesthesia. Post-operatively, she was given antibiotics and pain medication. However, she developed hypotension and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infection.

Further investigations showed elevated levels of creatinine, indicating possible acute renal failure. The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Her diabetes mellitus puts her at risk for other infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or osteomyelitis.

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. Imaging reveals increased opacity in the right lung apex, which could represent consolidation. Microbiology tests from foot cultures show the presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods.

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presents with a left foot infection and hypotension. The patient has been receiving fluid boluses, antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl), and pain management. She is expected to undergo surgery tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to infection, medication effects, hypovolemia, or acute cardiac syndrome. Immediate management includes IV fluids and careful monitoring.
2. Left Foot Infection: The infection in the patient's left foot may progress to cellulitis or osteomyelitis, especially considering her diabetes mellitus. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 2.0, indicating possible acute renal failure. Causes could include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, infection, or hypovolemia. Renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures taken to avoid nephrotoxins.
4. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome or arrhythmias. Continued cardiac monitoring and management with ASA, atenol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypotension and a left foot infection. They underwent wound debridement in the operating room, during which they received fluids and were sedated with Propofol and Versed. Post-operatively, the patient developed a fever of 102.8Â°F and their mental status was not at baseline. Cultures were sent for the foot and blood, and additional urine cultures were ordered. The patient's vital signs showed tachycardia, hypotension, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring revealed fluid balance within normal limits. The patient required supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula but had normal oxygen saturation levels. ABG results indicated normal respiratory function. Physical examination findings included peripheral vascular issues, skin assessment not performed, and neurologic assessment also not performed. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver enzymes. Imaging revealed increased opacity in the right lung apex, which could represent consolidation. Microbiology reports from previous days showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and gram-negative rods from the foot culture. The patient's assessment includes fever of unknown origin, pain control, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension not due to shock. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylaxis measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presents with left foot infection and hypotension. The patient underwent an operation yesterday and cultures were sent from the foot. She has been ruled out for myocardial infarction but may have aspirated after being taken to the operating room. Her chest X-ray shows right upper lobe opacity, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids for blood pressure management, and antibiotics have been started to cover potential infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis. She also has altered mental status, likely secondary to the infection, and acute renal failure, which is expected to improve with appropriate fluid management. The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She is also diabetic and requires medication management. The patient's diet will be advanced as her mental status tolerates, and she will receive supplemental IV fluids. The patient has two peripheral intravenous lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock due to the known diabetic foot infection and hypotension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

Over the past 24 hours, several significant events have occurred. The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo which showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as mild pulmonary hypertension. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 45-50%. 

The patient also had blood cultures taken, and a fever of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded at 8:00 PM on April 21st. The patient underwent a second debridement of his foot, where a loculated area with pus was removed. After the procedure, the patient experienced tachycardia, increased oxygen requirement, and hypertension. A chest X-ray showed fluid overload, leading to the administration of 20mg IV Lasix and subsequent normalization of blood pressure and pulse. A total of 1.4 liters of fluid was removed.

The patient has several known allergies, including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, wool alcohols causing itchiness, latex resulting in rash and wheezing, and trimethoprim with unknown reaction. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin at 8:25 PM on April 21st, Ciprofloxacin at 10:00 PM on April 21st, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 6:19 AM on April 22nd.

The patient is receiving various infusions and medications in the ICU, including furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular examination. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) level is elevated, while troponin-T, lactate, and lactic acid levels are within normal ranges. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and enzymes are also provided.

The patient is being managed for fever of unknown origin, acute and chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient's nutritional needs, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being addressed in the ICU.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications, including CAD, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. Further evaluation and management are required to address these issues and optimize the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presents with left foot infection and hypotension. The patient was initially suspected of septic shock but was found to have fluid overload on examination. She underwent a second debridement of her infected foot and is currently on IV antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl) for a potential pseudomonas infection. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, but she appears to be lucid at the moment. Her renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 2.0 on transfer to the ICU to 0.9 this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an active left foot infection that requires ongoing management with antibiotics. There is a risk of progression or spread of the infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which was initially concerning for septic shock. Although her blood pressure normalized after fluid resuscitation, ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any further episodes of hypotension.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 2.0 on transfer to the ICU, indicating potential acute renal failure. Her renal function has improved to 0.9 this morning, likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with left foot infection and hypotension. The patient was initially taken to the operating room for debridement of the foot infection. Cultures were sent from the foot, and blood cultures were also obtained. The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.

The patient subsequently became hypertensive with tachycardia and was given diuretics due to fluid overload on the exam. Net negative 1 liter of fluid, and blood pressure and heart rate normalized. The patient is being maintained with intravenous fluids for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

The patient has been started on increased dosing of vancomycin to compensate for normalization of renal function, and blood levels of vancomycin will be monitored tonight. She will continue with ciprofloxacin and zosyn for the foot infection, covering potential pseudomonas, until cultures are negative. Repeat urine analysis was negative.

The patient's left foot pain and infection required a second debridement yesterday. She will continue with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and zosyn for the diabetic foot infection, covering for potential pseudomonas. Pain control with tramadol as needed. Follow-up with podiatry recommendations and culture data.

Blood cultures were taken at different times, as well as an EKG. The patient also had a fever of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient experienced tachycardia and hypertension last night, which were attributed to volume overload. Lasix 20 mg IV was administered, resulting in the removal of 1 liter and improvement of symptoms.

The patient has allergies to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (oral), wool alcohols causing itchiness, latex causing rash and wheezing, trimethoprim (unknown), and ciprofloxacin.

The patient received various medications including Ciprofloxacin at 10:00 PM on 04/21/2130, Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:19 AM on 04/22/2130, and Vancomycin at 08:00 AM on 04/22/2130.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with sepsis due to an infected diabetic foot. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 117/55 to 189/107 mmHg, heart rate between 83 and 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 22 and 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals general alertness, normal air movement with diminished bases in the chest, an obese abdomen with normal tenderness, and an extremity with a wrapped left foot showing signs of chronic diabetic infection.

Regarding laboratory results, the patient has a white blood cell count ranging from 10.7 to 17.6 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin levels between 30.7 and 33.5 grams per deciliter, platelet count ranging from 105 to 209 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine levels between 0.9 and 1.9 milligrams per deciliter, troponin T levels below 0.01, and other lab values within normal limits.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has sepsis secondary to an infected diabetic foot, with ongoing broad antibiotic coverage and awaiting culture results. The patient's hemodynamics were initially unstable but responded to diuretic treatment. Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal"
