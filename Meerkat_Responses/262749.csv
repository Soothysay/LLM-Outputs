","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented to the hospital feeling unwell and was found to have a saturation level of 70%, leading to intubation and subsequent hypotension. The patient was started on dopamine and developed myoclonic activity, so diltiazem and neo were initiated. He was transferred to the ICU, where a central venous line (CVL) was placed, and dopamine was weaned off while continuing neo through the CVL. A chest X-ray revealed left-sided consolidation. The patient received CTX and azithromycin, and here he received vancomycin, levofloxacin, and zosyn. 

The patient's arterial line and multi-lumen lines were started on the 27th of March at 04:32 AM and 06:13 AM respectively. His allergies include a last dose of antibiotics (Zosyn) given on the 27th of March at 07:06 AM, and Levofloxacin given on the 27th of March at 07:14 AM. 

The patient is currently on propofol and phenylephrine infusions. Other ICU medications include hydrocortisone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, heparin, fentanyl, and versed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and has a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The FiO2 is set at 80% to maintain an SpO2 of 98%. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable with a range of 135/56-86/43 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal limits at 50-74 bpm, but the respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 24 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is normal, and the CVP is at the lower end of the normal range at 0 mmHg. The fluid balance shows an input of 7,856 mL and an output of 2,720 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,136 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including an elevated WBC count of 26.3 K/uL, decreased Hct of 35.7%, and elevated Cr levels of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been experiencing subjective fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which are concerning for septic shock. Other potential etiologies for his condition include cardiogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's goals of care have been clarified by the family, and no further escalation of care is wanted. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as vasopressor support with neosynephrine. He is also being ventilated at 6 cc/kg ideal body weight for height due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates, meeting criteria for ARDS. The patient has multifocal atrial tachycardia, likely related to underlying lung disease. His lung cancer diagnosis is approximately one year old, and the extent of metastatic disease is unclear. The patient's congestive heart failure status is unclear, and beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are being held. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transitioned to comfort measures only (CMO) care today with family request.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and congestive heart failure. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and hypotension. The patient had subjective fevers at home, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which raised concerns for septic shock. Other potential causes for his condition include cardiogenic shock due to congestive heart failure and adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use. The patient's goals of care have been clarified, and no further escalation of care is desired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 117 and bilateral infiltrates on CXR, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: This is likely related to underlying lung disease. The patient's heart rate is currently in the 70s off diltiazem.
3. Shock: The patient is at risk for septic shock, possibly secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other potential etiologies include cardiogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency.
4. Lung Cancer: The patient has a history of lung cancer, but the extent of metastatic disease is unclear. This could potentially lead to further complications and spread of the cancer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for comfort measures only (CMO) due to a terminal illness. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, arterial lines, and multi-lumen catheters. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and daily assessment of sputum cultures may help in early detection and management.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin or intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and congestive heart failure who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and hypotension. The patient also had subjective fevers at home, leukocytosis, and hypotension concerning for septic shock, with other potential etiologies including cardiogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient's current condition includes being extubated, antibiotics and blood pressure support withdrawn, and goals of care clarified with no further escalation of care wanted. The patient meets criteria for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 117 and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient is also experiencing multifocal atrial tachycardia, likely related to underlying lung disease, and has a history of lung cancer with unclear treatment or metastatic disease. Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure with unclear ejection fraction.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further episodes of hypotension or shock, worsening heart failure, and potential worsening of the multifocal atrial tachycardia.

   Shock:  Patient with subjective fevers at home, leukocytosis and
   hypotension concerning for septic shock.  Other potential etiologies
   for this patient include cardiogenic shock given his history of
   congestive heart failure and adrenal insufficiency given chronic
   steroids.  Less likely etiologies are hypovolemic, hemorrhagic, or
   obstructive shock.  In terms of etiologies for septic shock, pneumonia
   appears to be the most likely etiology although we will cover him
   broadly for now.  After discussion with family, goals of care
   clarified, no further escalation of care wanted.  Patient extubated,
   abx and blood pressure support withdrawn.
   - will involve social work
   - no fluid boluses for BP support
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Patient with tenuous lung function at
   baseline with known malignancy, home oxygen requirement and obstructive
   lung disease.  PaO2/FiO2 = 117.  Given bilateral infiltrates and no
   clear evidence for congestive heart failure meets criteria for ARDS.
