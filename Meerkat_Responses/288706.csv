","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, bleeding from ostomy, hypotension, and GNR bacteremia. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including sepsis without organ dysfunction, shock, high ostomy output/diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, acute renal failure, RUE edema, anemia, H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots, tachycardia, wound, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which indicates a bacterial infection that could potentially lead to sepsis. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor vital signs closely.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a need to avoid nephrotoxins and dose medications appropriately.
3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding from the ostomy site, which may require further investigation and management to prevent excessive blood loss.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the preliminary right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, it is essential to follow up with a final read of the US to rule out any potential clot formation.
5. Port-Related Clots: The patient has a history of port-related clots, and fondaparinux"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, bleeding from ostomy, hypotension, and GNR bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and is currently on pressors. The patient also has a history of cancer, shock, high ostomy output/diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, acute renal failure, RUE edema, anemia, h/o PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots, tachycardia, wound, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests sepsis due to GNR bacteremia and hypotension. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor the patient closely for any signs of organ dysfunction or deterioration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in renal function with IVFs. However, it is essential to avoid nephrotoxins and adjust medication dosages based on renal function to prevent further decline in renal function.
3. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding from the ostomy site and low hemoglobin levels indicate a risk of ongoing blood loss. Active monitoring and transfusion for a goal hemoglobin >21% may be necessary to prevent anemia and stabilize the patient's condition.
4. Port-related Clots: The patient's history of PE/SVC syndrome and port-related clots"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, bleeding from ostomy, hypotension, and GNR bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, which has resolved as she is currently off pressors with stable blood pressures. She also has high ostomy output/diarrhea, acute renal failure, right lower extremity edema, anemia, history of pulmonary embolism/superior vena cava syndrome, tachycardia, and a wound that requires attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system and the presence of GNR bacteremia.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal function is impaired, and there is a need to avoid nephrotoxins and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding from the ostomy site, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and SVC syndrome, indicating an increased risk of future thromboembolic events.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to receive adequate nutrition may be compromised due to the ostomy and diarrhea.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, indicating a risk of recurrent hypotension.

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and sepsis, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been weaned off pressors completely since 10am and surgery determined that intervention would likely cause more harm than good due to multiple surgeries and adhesions. The patient has multiple allergies, including latex, oxaliplatin, iodine, fluconazole, and angioedema with ace inhibitors. The patient has received antibiotics such as vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/52 to 128/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,846 mL and output of 5,020 mL, with a negative balance of 1,174 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with SpO2 at 98%.
