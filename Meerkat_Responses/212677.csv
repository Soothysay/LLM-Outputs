   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Per report, patient was demonstrating increased
   work of breathing in the ED with resp rates in the 30s.  No ABG done
   prior to intubation.  Patient does have a history of COPD and CHF with
   last ECHO showing EF of 35-40%.  On arrival to the ICU, patient was
   demonstrated large negative pressures with low PIPs around 12.  Initial
   ABG was actually venous and was 7.16/56/48.  Repeat just after
   increased tidal volumes, ABG was 7.22/43/302 on FiO2 100%.  Likely has
   increased dead space in the setting of hypovolemia and hypoperfusion as
   well.
   - Continue to titrate vent settings to achieve target minute
   ventilation as patient has component of respiratory acidosis in
   addition to non-AG metabolic acidosis
   - Will attempt to wean as acidosis improves
   - VAP precautions
   - Repeat CXR in am
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.
   - Will check Urine AG
   - Nutrition consult for TPN
   - Avoid NS for resuscitation given hyperchloremia and hypernatremia
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient was noted to have tachycardia (afib vs ST vs
   MAT) during last admission which was treated with IV lopressor
   transitioned to PO lopressor.  A CTA at that time was negative for PE
   and CE ruled out MI.  Cardiology at that time felt that the rhythm was
   likely sinus tachy with APBs/MAT, and recommended watching as well as
   possibly initiating digoxin which was not started at that time.
   - Will cycle CE
   - Continue dilt gtt, will transition to home metoprolol as tolerated
   - IVF for dehydration
   - Continue to follow
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Has been ongoing for several days at rehab.  Unclear
   if patient has received more than 1L of free water as it is not
   documented in NH paperwork.
   - Calculated free water deficit is 2.8L
   - Will give D51/2NS now given dehydration and free water deficit
   - PM lytes
   - Urine lytes now
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12 and folate within
   normal limits.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Will send iron studies
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   - Continue coumadin 2.5 mg daily
   - Continue to trend INR
   - LUE US to rule out DVT at PICC site
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient appears dry on exam.  Likely
   pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or ATN as above.
   - Urine lytes
   - IVF resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose all meds
   .
   # Ruptured apendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl
   - Will consult surgery for further recommendations regarding medical
   mgmt and abx course
   - As lactate wnl and patient appears dry with BP responding to fluid
   boluses, will continue cipro/flagyl for appendicitis as no other clear
   source of infection.  BPs currently normal
   - Low threshold to increase abx regimen should patient become unstable
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole
   (is on omeprazole as o/p as well), bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line, need to confirm placement, PIV
   .

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix.
- The patient was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.
- The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, non-AG metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, hypernatremia, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, acute on chronic renal failure, ruptured appendix, and pancreatic mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a need to continue titrating vent settings to achieve target minute ventilation and wean the patient as acidosis improves. VAP precautions should also be maintained.
2. Non-AG metabolic acidosis: The differential includes saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion), increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA. Checking urine AG, nutrition consult for TPN, avoiding NS for resuscitation, and continuing to trend are recommended.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia (afib vs ST vs MAT) during the last admission, which was treated with IV lopressor transitioned to PO lopressor. A CTA"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate a critical condition. The combination of IVF (inhalation of gastric contents), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and profound metabolic acidosis puts the patient at risk for further respiratory failure.

2. Fever: The patient has been febrile since admission, with a temperature of 101.2°F. The fever may be due to worsening of an underlying infection, aspiration pneumonitis from intubation, or an occult infectious process. The lack of elevated WBC count makes it difficult to determine the cause.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia, which was treated with IV lopressor and transitioned to PO lopressor during a previous admission. The rhythm is likely sinus tachycardia with atrioventricular blocks (APBs) or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). The patient is currently on diltiazem drip, which needs to be titrated down as tolerated and transitioned to home metoprolol when able to take oral medications.

4. Non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis: The patient has a NAG metabolic acidosis with a urine chloride level of 28 mEq/L. The differential diagnosis includes saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion), increased amino acids in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has ongoing hypernatremia, likely due to inadequate fluid resuscitation. The calculated free water deficit is 2.8 L, and the patient received 0.5 L of D51/2NS followed by 1.5 L of D5W overnight. Transitioning to D5W with 3 amps of sodium bicarbonate for intravenous fluids (IVF) is recommended.

6. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient appears dry on examination, suggesting pre-renal azotemia. However, there may be a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or RTA contributing to the renal failure. FENa is 1.26%, indicating that it is not entirely pre-renal. IVF resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxins, renal dosing of medications, and a nephrology consult are necessary.

7. Anemia: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted with hypernatremia and is now intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including fever, tachycardia, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, ruptured appendix, and a pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. Ventilator settings need to be titrated to achieve target minute ventilation and maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly related to the ruptured appendix or other sources such as aspiration pneumonitis or occult infectious process. Further investigation is needed, including cultures and imaging studies.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia, which could be related to atrial fibrillation or other causes. It is important to monitor heart rate and consider medications like beta-blockers to control the heart rate.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal failure or saline resuscitation. Sodium bicarbonate may be required for correction.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and is now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). ABG much better now
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of cardiogenic shock, however, given pt
s HR has gone up, now
   persistently in 130s. + pressor requirement for BP support. Dilt gtt
   was d/c
d yesterday. [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim checked (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL.
   - Consider trial of phenylephrine instead of levophed to eliminate
   positive chronotropy
   - Consider adding oral BBker for rate control
   - Consider chemical cardioversion with amio
   - PE unlikely given pt has been on lovenox, now on heparin gtt.
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 24 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday given decompensation.
   - Add fluconazole for empiric coverage of fungal (stop TPN while
   getting treated for ?fungemia)
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - CT negative for any drainable abscesses.
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got
   bicarb with IVF yesterday
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: resolved.
   - monitor
   - judicious use of normal saline
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient now adequately fluid
   resuscitated.  Likely pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or
   ATN as above.  FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.  Cont. heparin gtt and hold
   coumadin as avoiding PO meds until further information from CT
   abdomen.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   .
   # Ruptured apendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn for broad spectrum coverage in the absence
   of specific microbio data
   - appreciate [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, hold TPN while
   +suspicion of fungemia.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole
   (is on omeprazole as o/p as well), bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line, A-line, PIV. Likely needs a fem line given the
   number of IV medications pt is receiving.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is now intubated for respiratory failure and has multiple medical complications including fever, non-AG metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, ruptured appendix, pancreatic mass, and fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of IVF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is most likely due to septic state. There may also be a component of cardiogenic shock, but the patient's heart rate has increased and persistently stays in the 130s. Pressor requirement is needed for blood pressure support.
3. Fever: The patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a ruptured appendix. The fever may represent worsening of this process or aspiration pneumonitis from intubation. Other occult infectious processes should be considered.
4. Non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: This condition has resolved, but it can be caused by saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and is now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). ABG much better now
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of cardiogenic shock, however, given pt
s HR has gone up, now
   persistently in 130s. + pressor requirement for BP support. Dilt gtt
   was d/c
d yesterday. [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim checked (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL.
   - Consider trial of phenylephrine instead of levophed to eliminate
   positive chronotropy
   - Consider adding oral BBker for rate control
   - Consider chemical cardioversion with amio
   - PE unlikely given pt has been on lovenox, now on heparin gtt.
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 24 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday given decompensation.
   - Add fluconazole for empiric coverage of fungal (stop TPN while
   getting treated for ?fungemia)
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - CT negative for any drainable abscesses.
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is now intubated for respiratory failure and requires pressor support. He has a history of septic state, mixed venous O2 saturation indicating distributive shock, and a component of cardiogenic shock. The patient's heart rate has increased persistently in the 130s. He is on mechanical ventilation, and his ABG shows improved pH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IVF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and profound metabolic acidosis. There is a trial of pressure support ventilation in anticipation of weaning off the ventilator.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which is most likely due to a septic state. There is a possibility of distributive shock, and the patient may also have a component of cardiogenic shock. The patient requires pressor support for blood pressure management.
3. Fever: The patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a ruptured appendix. The fever may represent worsening of this process, aspiration pneumonitis from intubation, or another occult infectious process.
4. Non-AG metabolic acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16).   Patient was overbreathing
   the ventilator overnight when less sedated to increase pH and
   simultaneously driving down CO2.  Minute ventilation 12-17L/min.
   Patient has a history of COPD and likely chronically has a high CO2.
   Will not try to achieve his baseline CO2 currently as there is still an
   ongoing metabolic acidosis.
   - Continue to titrate vent settings to achieve target minute
   ventilation around 12-13 L/min
   - Will attempt to wean as acidosis improves
   - VAP precautions
   - Repeat CXR in am
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count.
   - Cont. cipro & flagyl
   - CT abdomen to examine for interval changes, worsening appendicitis
   vs. duodenal-pancreatic communication given low HCO3
   - f/u blood, urine, & sputum cultures
   - trend fever curve & WBC count.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient was noted to have tachycardia (afib vs ST vs
   MAT) during last admission which was treated with IV lopressor
   transitioned to PO lopressor.  A CTA at that time was negative for PE
   and CE ruled out MI.  Cardiology at that time felt that the rhythm was
   likely sinus tachy with APBs/MAT, and recommended watching as well as
   possibly initiating digoxin which was not started at that time.
   Patient has ruled out for an MI again.  Dilt drip stable at 10 mg/hr
   overnight with heart rates in the low 100s and SBP in the low 100s.
   Unable to transition to PO meds at this time as patient is NPO due to
   ruptured appendix.
   - Continue dilt gtt, titrate down as tolerated and transition to home
   metoprolol when able to take POs
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.
   - Switch to NaHCO3 for fluid resuscitation given hyperchloremia and
   hypernatremia
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Has been ongoing for several days at rehab.  Unclear
   if patient has received more than 1L of free water as it is not
   documented in NH paperwork.
   - Calculated free water deficit is 2.8L
   - Patient received 0.5 L D51/2NS then 1.5L D5W overnight.
   - transition to D5W + 3amps NaHCO3 for IVF
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient appears dry on exam.  Likely
   pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or ATN as above.  FENa
   1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - IVF resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose all meds
   - nephrology consult
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.  Cont. heparin gtt and hold
   coumadin as avoiding PO meds until further information from CT
   abdomen.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   .
   # Ruptured apendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - As lactate wnl and patient appears dry with BP responding to fluid
   boluses, will continue cipro/flagyl for appendicitis as no other clear
   source of infection.  BPs currently normal
   - Low threshold to increase abx regimen should patient become unstable
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, nutrition consult for
   TPN recs
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. He is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and low urine output. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated empirically for potential infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current presentation of fever, hypotension, and low urine output suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and management.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his current condition may worsen due to inadequate renal function, leading to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Regular assessment and prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as he may develop acute respiratory failure if his underlying lung condition deteriorates.
5. Infection Control: Proper infection control practices should be followed to minimize the risk of healthcare-associated infections,"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with history of ruptured appendix and now with recurrent
   hypotension with A-Fib with RVR seen at admission.  Despite some volume
   support patient has clear evidence of pre-renal azotemia  and
   persistent hypotension.  This in light of CT findings would suggest
   that patient may well have alternative source of acute
   infection--catheter related blood stream infection and pneumonia are
   leading possible source.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Patient with decreased alertness on sedation but
   patient with good tolerance of PSV and have some improvement in HCO3-
   with support and hope to be able to wean ventilatory support today.
   -PSV-[**11-7**] today
   -Wean as tolerated by RR and HR in the setting of improved acidosis
   2)Sepsis-
   -Levophed continues at 0.24
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Follow up culture results and will cover for fungal infection in the
   setting of prolonged exposure to anti-bacterials and possible GI source
   -IVF
bolus as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ruptured appendix and recurrent hypotension with atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) upon admission. The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia and persistent hypotension, suggesting an alternative source of acute infection, such as a catheter-related blood stream infection or pneumonia. 

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and requires ventilatory support. The plan is to attempt to wean off the ventilator today, depending on the patient's tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) and improvement in blood bicarbonate levels (HCO3-).

Sepsis is also present, and the patient is on pressors, specifically levophed, and receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. Follow-up culture results will be awaited, and coverage for fungal infection will be considered due to prolonged exposure to antibacterials and possible gastrointestinal source. IV fluids will be given as needed, and attempts will be made to wean off levophed as possible.

Atrial fibrillation is ongoing, with limited response to PRN IV medications. Rate control medications will be initiated as soon as possible. Diltiazem (Dilt) will be used as needed, and consideration will be given to cardioversion only for persistent and refractory hypotension despite pressors.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is present and will be continued with"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and is now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). ABG much better now
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of cardiogenic shock, however, given pt
s HR has gone up, now
   persistently in 130s. + pressor requirement for BP support. Dilt gtt
   was d/c
d yesterday. [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim checked (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL.
   - Consider trial of phenylephrine instead of levophed to eliminate
   positive chronotropy
   - Consider adding oral BBker for rate control
   - Consider chemical cardioversion with amio
   - PE unlikely given pt has been on lovenox, now on heparin gtt.
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 24 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday given decompensation.
   - Add fluconazole for empiric coverage of fungal (stop TPN while
   getting treated for ?fungemia)
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - CT negative for any drainable abscesses.
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got
   bicarb with IVF yesterday
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: resolved.
   - monitor
   - judicious use of normal saline
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient now adequately fluid
   resuscitated.  Likely pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or
   ATN as above.  FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.  Cont. heparin gtt and hold
   coumadin as avoiding PO meds until further information from CT
   abdomen.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   .
   # Ruptured apendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn for broad spectrum coverage in the absence
   of specific microbio data
   - appreciate [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, hold TPN while
   +suspicion of fungemia.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole
   (is on omeprazole as o/p as well), bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line, A-line, PIV. Likely needs a fem line given the
   number of IV medications pt is receiving.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is now intubated for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated for respiratory failure, which may be due to a combination of IV fluid administration, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and profound metabolic acidosis.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR, and it is likely due to septic state. There is also a component of cardiogenic shock, as indicated by the patient's persistent tachycardia and requirement for pressor support.

3. Fever: The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for medical management of ruptured appendicitis. The fever could represent worsening of this process, aspiration pneumonitis from intubation, or an occult infectious process. The lack of elevated WBC count suggests that the patient may not be able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to age and chronic illness.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and is now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). ABG much better now
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of cardiogenic shock, however, given pt

   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 24 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn [**4-23**] given decompensation.
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got
   bicarb with IVF yesterday
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: resolved.

   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron

   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   - Transition to coumadin if extubated
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is now intubated for respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, and various medications including amiodarone for chemical cardioversion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IVF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. The ABG values have improved, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been initiated in anticipation of weaning off the ventilator.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is most likely due to septic state. The mixed venous O2 saturation is high, indicating distributive shock. There is also a component of cardiogenic shock, but the patient's heart rate has increased persistently in the 130s. Pressor requirement for blood pressure support continues, and diltiazem has been discontinued.

3. Fever: The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and flagyl for medical management of ruptured appendicitis. The fever may represent worsening of this process, aspiration pneumonitis from intubation, or an occult infectious process. The absence"

He has a right subclavian vein thrombosis and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's pancreatic mass appears stable on repeat imaging. He requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a history of COPD and atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may contribute to his respiratory distress.
2. Septic State: The patient has a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity, hypernatremia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and cardiac support. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a heart rate of 118 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 70/48 mmHg to 95/56 mmHg. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid, as well as low albumin and potassium levels. Imaging studies show no significant changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates an increased risk for further infection and septic shock.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a DVT in the right upper extremity may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure puts him at risk for further deterioration of kidney function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.
4. Hypernatremia: The high sodium level can result in neurological complications, including seizures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity. The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and a current temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 118 beats per minute, and blood pressure is on the lower side at 95/56 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 98% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and calcium. The white blood cell count is within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, amiodarone, fentanyl, and norepinephrine. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and the ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's recent interventions include the placement of a right femoral central venous catheter, failed trials of neosynephrine, cardioversion attempts, and the use of levophed overnight. The patient has also been on prolonged sedation with midazolam and has had multiple blood cultures taken.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening renal function, ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and further cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential for this critically ill patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with history of ruptured appendicitis now re-admitted with
   hypotension consistent with sepsis but have not been able to clearly
   identify new source.  He has had significant improvement with
   Amiodarone in regards to heart rate and although cardioversion failed
   he has had improved heart rate control and occasional sinus beats.
   1)Shock--Likely combined sepsis and cardiogenic contribution and will
   Rx as-->
   Sepsis--Continue with broad spectrum ABX and PRN fluid
   bolus-_Vanco/ZOsyn
definative source of recurrent infection not clearly
   Levophed to wean and Vasopressin to wean off
   A-Fib--Continue with amiodarone
   and->will attempt to provide wean of levophed as primary measure to
   evaluate improvement in hemodynamics.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with good tolerance of decreased in PSV
   and having minimal secretions and actually opening eyes to voice.  Most
   challenging issue is persistent tachycardia, persistent hypotension.
   Secretions minimal
   -SBT this morning
   -Check ABG at 30 minutes
   -Will need to check anesthesia notes as to difficulty of airway.
   -metabolic issues (acidosis), possible pulmonary edema, poor mental
   status are all barriers that must be considered.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-he does have stable creatinine across time
   -Will provide HCO3- as needed for acidosis should HCO3- decrease below
   16
   -Appreciate renal input
   -Will renal dose all medications
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-
   _Failed cardioversion
   -Continue Amiodarone
   -Hope for SR conversion
   5)Thrombosis-DVT
   -Continue with Heparin
   -To Coumadin when stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ruptured appendicitis, re-admitted with hypotension consistent with sepsis. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and PRN fluid bolus. The patient's heart rate has improved with Amiodarone, but cardioversion was unsuccessful. He is currently in persistent atrial fibrillation and requires continued treatment with Amiodarone.

The patient is experiencing shock, likely due to a combined septic and cardiogenic contribution. Efforts are being made to wean off Levophed and Vasopressin. The patient also has respiratory failure, with minimal secretions and tolerance of decreased PSV. An SBT was performed this morning, and ABG will be checked at 30 minutes. Anesthesia notes should be reviewed for airway difficulties. Metabolic issues, possible pulmonary edema, and poor mental status are also considerations.

The patient has acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels. HCO3- will be provided as needed for acidosis if it decreases below 16. Renal input is appreciated, and renal dosing of medications will be done. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which failed cardioversion, so Amiodarone will continue to be administered. There is a concern for thrombosis, specifically DVT, and Heparin will continue to be used. When the patient is stable, Coumadin will be initiated. Nutrition"

   CXR
   The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The bilateral pleural effusions are
   moderate to large. The study is extremely limited due to the patient's
   head
   overlying right upper lung. Overall little change compared to the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Was not extubated last night
   due to hemodynamic instability. Needs
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Try RSBI and SBT,
   if favorable, extubate later today
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (very sedated)
   and minute volume requirement required to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Cardiology was consulted last night;
   recommended digoxin loading.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio, digoxin (dose by level
   given ARF)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - consider repeating echo
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and required intubation for respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation, and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IVF (intravenous fluids), AFib with RVR, and profound metabolic acidosis. He was not extubated last night due to hemodynamic instability. The plan is to try pressure support ventilation (PSV) in anticipation of weaning off the ventilator. If the respiratory system bilinear index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) are favorable, extubation may be considered later today. Issues that could complicate extubation include mental status (very sedated) and the need for a high minute volume to compensate for metabolic acidosis.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient has AFib with RVR, which is most likely due to septic state. He also has a history of AFib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed venous O2 saturation was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although the patient may have a component of cardiogenic shock, he did not"

   CXR
   The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The bilateral pleural effusions are
   moderate to large. The study is extremely limited due to the patient's
   head
   overlying right upper lung. Overall little change compared to the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Was not extubated last night
   due to hemodynamic instability. Needs
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Try RSBI and SBT,
   if favorable, extubate later today
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (very sedated)
   and minute volume requirement required to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Cardiology was consulted last night;
   recommended digoxin loading.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio, digoxin (dose by level
   given ARF)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - consider repeating echo
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. There is a concern
   for fungal infection given pt
s prolonged abx course and frequent
   hospital stays.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn [**4-23**] given decompensation. (Day 3 today)
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole; will f/u glucan and galactomannin and

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition has been complicated by several events over the past 24 hours. These include an increase in the level of vancomycin and the order for a new level, the initiation of tube feeds with nutrition, the placement of a central venous catheter (c/s), the restart of Coumadin due to its interaction with amiodarone, the unsuccessful extubation attempt due to poor gases, fluctuations in levophed dosage, tachycardia, hypotension, and the consultation of cardiology. The cardiology team recommended loading the patient with digoxin and repeating the dose in 6 hours. They also suggested checking the digoxin level on the next day and adjusting the dose accordingly. If the patient's blood pressure improves, they proposed considering metoprolol 2.5 mg IV and/or reloading amiodarone. The team also discussed the possibility of an ECHO for congestive heart failure given the patient's prolonged length of stay (>14 days).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity.
2. Metabolic acidosis.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is not due to ARDS. The patient is also experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, fever, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 89/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, and lactate acid. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's albumin level is low at 2.2 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed promptly. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction requires close monitoring. If the infection spreads or the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and is now intubated for respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). ABG much better now
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of cardiogenic shock, however, given pt
s HR has gone up, now
   persistently in 130s. + pressor requirement for BP support. Dilt gtt
   was d/c
d yesterday. [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim checked (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 24 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn [**4-23**] given decompensation.
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got
   bicarb with IVF yesterday
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: resolved.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient now adequately fluid
   resuscitated.  Likely pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or
   ATN as above.  FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - F/u nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   - Transition to coumadin if extubated
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn for broad spectrum coverage in the absence
   of specific microbio data
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, TF/po intake post
   extubation
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole
   (is on omeprazole as o/p as well), bowel regimen
   .

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix who was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is now intubated for respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely a combination of IVF, AFib with RVR, and profound metabolic acidosis. He is being trial for PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent.

Hemodynamics: AFib with RVR most likely due to septic state. The patient has a history of AFib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed venous O2 Sat high suggestive of distributive shock. There is also a component of cardiogenic shock, however, given the patient's HR has gone up, now persistently in 130s. + pressor requirement for BP support. Diligent gtt was discontinued yesterday.

   CXR
   The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The bilateral pleural effusions are
   moderate to large. The study is extremely limited due to the patient's
   head
   overlying right upper lung. Overall little change compared to the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Was not extubated last night
   due to hemodynamic instability. Needs
   - Trial of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Try RSBI and SBT,
   if favorable, extubate later today
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (very sedated)
   and minute volume requirement required to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Cardiology was consulted last night;
   recommended digoxin loading.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio, digoxin (dose by level
   given ARF)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - consider repeating echo
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count and has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a
   robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically
   ill state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. There is a concern
   for fungal infection given pt
s prolonged abx course and frequent
   hospital stays.
   - Abx switched to Vanc/Zosyn [**4-23**] given decompensation. (Day 3 today)
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole; will f/u glucan and galactomannin and
   re-assess once data available.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: resolved. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Got
   bicarb with IVF yesterday
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient now adequately fluid
   resuscitated.  Likely pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or
   ATN as above.  FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - F/u nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   - Transition to coumadin if extubated
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn for broad spectrum coverage in the absence
   of specific microbio data

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He required intubation for respiratory failure due to a combination of IVF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hemodynamics instability, fever, non-AG metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, ruptured appendicitis, and pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IVF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has been experiencing hemodynamic instability, which may be related to septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring and appropriate cardiovascular support are required to stabilize the patient's condition.

3. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers, which may indicate worsening of the ruptured appendicitis, aspiration pneumonia, or another occult infection. Surveillance blood cultures and further evaluation for infectious causes are recommended.

4. Non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with history of ruptured appendicitis and now admitted with
   significant tachycardia and hypotension with persistent A-Fib with RVR
   and associated hypotension.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is likely secondary to initial insult of
   sepsis, cardiogenic source of shock with A-fib and RVR and intubated in
   the setting of altered mental status.  He now has continued demand of
   persistent hypotension and tachycardia.
   -Atrovent
   -Continue with A/C support overnight
   -Today he will have trial of PSV which should allow evaluation of his
   capacity to tolerate extubation.
   -His increased demand from metabolic acidosis is minimized
   -Hope to move to SBT if favorable tolerance of PSV
if unable to
   tolerate SBT it may well be that diuresis and improved rate
   control/return to SR is needed for success.
   2)Sepsis-Source remains to be defined
   _vanco/Zosyn to continue for 10 day course
   -Follow up culture results
   -Will hope to wean pressors as sedation is weaned around extubation.
   Would like to move to diuresis if possible.
   -Will need to follow fungal cultures
   3)Venous Thombosis-
   -Heparin GTT continuing
   -Coumadin started as will need long term anticoagulation and no
   procedures currently planned
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue with Amiodarone dosing
   -Continue with Digoxin
   -Will utilize nodal blockers to control residual rate elevations
   -Good control today
   -Will need to consider repeat ECHO

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ruptured appendicitis, currently admitted with significant tachycardia and hypotension, persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and associated hypotension. The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to initial sepsis, cardiogenic shock with atrial fibrillation, and rapid ventricular response. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on atropine and assisted ventilation support overnight. Today, he will have a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) to evaluate his capacity to tolerate extubation. If he is unable to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), it may indicate that diuresis and improved rate control/return to sinus rhythm are needed for success.
2. Sepsis: The source of sepsis remains to be defined. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will continue for a 10-day course. Follow-up culture results will be monitored, and pressors will be weaned as sedation is weaned around extubation. Diuresis may be considered if possible, and fungal cultures will be followed.
3. Venous Thrombosis: Heparin GTT (gradual titration therapy) will continue, and Coumadin has been started for long-term anticoagulation since no procedures are currently planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Was not extubated yesterday
   due to pH 7.19 after one hour on PS.
   - Continue trials of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Try RSBI
   and SBT
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (very sedated)
   and minute volume requirement required to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Cardiology was consulted last night;
   recommended digoxin loading.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio, digoxin (dose by level
   given ARF)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - repeat  echo pending
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. There is a concern for
   fungal infection given pt
s prolonged abx course and frequent hospital
   stays. Yeast in urine and sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-23**] given initial decompensation. (Day 4
   today)
   - Surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole; will f/u glucan and galactomannin and
   re-assess once data available.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Has
   received Bicarb. Likely to improve with diuresis.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal. Maintaining good UOP.
   - F/u nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15.5L positive).
   He was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.1.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**7-17**] (started [**4-21**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and a ruptured appendix.
- He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to intubation for respiratory failure.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IV fluids, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 106.
- Hemodynamics show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is most likely due to septic state. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is high, suggesting distributive shock.
- The patient's fever may represent worsening of the ruptured appendicitis, aspiration pneumonia from intubation, or other occult infectious processes. Notably, the patient does not have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted with hypernatremia and respiratory failure, and intubated due to a pH of 7.19 after one hour on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation. His renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury. He also has anemia, likely due to chronic kidney disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has developed a right subclavian vein thrombosis and is on anticoagulation therapy. His condition is complicated by fever, which could be related to aspiration pneumonia, occult infection, or fungal infection. The patient's metabolic acidosis is non-anion gap and may be due to saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure, or increased amino acids in total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely a combination of intravenous fluid administration, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and profound metabolic acidosis. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to mental status (very sedated) and the requirement for a high minute volume to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
2. Hemodynamics: Atrial fibrillation with RVR is present, likely due to septic state. The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous sepsis. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, pain management, and antibiotics.

24-hour events:
- Renal: The patient experienced non-oliguric renal failure with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension. Diuretics were not given due to the patient's positive fluid balance. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is not required at this time.
- Pulmonary: The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) are within normal range. The respiratory rate (RR) is slightly elevated, and the tidal volume (Vt) is set at 500 mL.
- Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure (BP) is low, and he is on norepinephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AFib), and the heart rate (HR) is tachycardic.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

Infusions:
The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management, midazolam for sedation, amiodarone for arrhythmia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, fever, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, amiodarone, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and lansoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - The patient has acute respiratory failure, but ARDS is not mentioned. If the patient's condition worsens, there is a possibility of developing ARDS.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity. There is a risk of developing further DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Renal failure - The patient has chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing non-oliguric renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function or developing acute kidney injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with history of ruptured appendicitis and now with
   readmission with clinical picture consistent with sepsis and source
   remains to be defined.  This in addition has associated metabolic
   acidosis and peristent mild renal failure.  His recent picture has been
   one of failed capacity to tolerate wean in ventilatory support and wean
   of pressor support for hypotension.  This again, is all in the absence
   of significant cluture or radiographic evidence of focal source of
   infection.  His clinical picture is one of progressive decline in terms
   of respiratory status and no expectation to be able to successfully
   wean from ventilator.  His atrial fibrillation has been able to be
   better rate controlled and patient has failed cardioversion and
   amiodarone to trial to achieve sinus rhythm.  In addition he has
   persistent hypotension which has required increased pressor
   requirements.
   1)Respiratory Failure
he is limited by mental status and worsening
   secretions and inability to maintain effective ventilation
   -Patient to PSV to trial today
   -Continue Rx for possible pneumonia-_Vanco/Zosyn continued at D#4
   -Will continue to wean sedation as possible
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Amiodarone
   -ECHO today
   -Cardiology to evaluate patient for possible alternative approaches to
   stabilize rhythm
   3)DVT-
   Heparin to Coumadin
   4)Sepsis-
   -Foley changed following fungal culture in urine
   -Continue with broad spectrum ABX
   -Continue with levophed.
   -Re-culture for spike.
   5)Renal Failure-
   -Patient total body overloaded
   -Cr has shown minimal change but significantly impaired
   -Continue to look for opportunity for diuresis and will use leveophed
   to maintain BP
   -Would not offer dialysis at this time
   -Lasix gtt. And will start with bolus

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of ruptured appendicitis and readmission for clinical sepsis. He also has associated metabolic acidosis and persistent mild renal failure. The patient has failed to tolerate weaning in ventilatory support and weaning of pressor support for hypotension. There is no significant culture or radiographic evidence of a focal source of infection. His clinical picture is one of progressive decline in respiratory status, and there is no expectation to successfully wean from the ventilator. He also has atrial fibrillation that has been better rate-controlled but failed cardioversion and amiodarone to achieve sinus rhythm. Additionally, the patient has persistent hypotension requiring increased pressor requirements.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain effective ventilation and worsening secretions pose a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress, leading to further heart rhythm disturbances and potential complications such as thromboembolism.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and other risk factors, there is a risk of developing DVT.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic state can worsen, potentially leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient has been receiving Lasix (furosemide) intravenously, which suggests the presence of fluid overload or heart failure.
2. The patient is suspected to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), as indicated by persistent tachycardia despite anticoagulation therapy. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to further evaluate this possibility.
3. The patient has been given a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to improve intravascular volume, likely due to hypotension or anemia.
4. The patient's likely wish is for interventions that are reversible or will provide comfort, indicating a discussion about end-of-life care.
5. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, amiodarone, norepinephrine, and furosemide.
6. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure (CRF) and is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.
7. The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
8. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 18, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and other parameters.
9. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (HR 119 bpm), hypertension (BP 116/62 mmHg), and hypoxemia (SpO2 96%).
10. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia (Na 147 mg/dL), chronic kidney disease (Hct 27.1%), and elevated lactate levels (0.9 mmol/L).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's persistent tachycardia and the suspicion of PE indicate a potential complication related to thromboembolic disease.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's respiratory failure and the use of mechanical ventilation raise the possibility of ARDS.
3. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection leading to sepsis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's impaired mobility and hypercoagulable state due to chronic renal failure may predispose him to developing DVT.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease, along with potential factors like sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications, could lead to further deterioration"

   TTE [**2107-4-26**]:
    The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a
   basal inferior aneurysm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is moderate to
   severe tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-4-12**], mitral
   regurgitation is now less prominent. The basal inferior aneurysm
   appears similar. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is now
   detected.
   CXR [**2107-4-27**]
   Bibasilar atelectasis, with small bilateral effusions. No
   significant interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). More alert and tolerating PS
   15/5 better this AM than previously.
   - Continue trials of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat
   RSBI
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (gets agitated
   when awake and overbreathes the vent to RR of 40) and minute volume
   requirement required to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs last night per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. Discuss switching to PO amio and d/c
   digoxin
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue lasix (started yesterday [**4-26**]) with goal 1L negative today
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx
   courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN. Yeast in urine and
   sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 6
   today)
   - Start fluconazole today for fungemia
   - Surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Has
   received Bicarb. Likely to improve with diuresis.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal.
   - monitor closely as lasix is being given
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15L positive).  He
   was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.2.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole

   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**7-17**] (started [**4-22**]) for broad spectrum

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Was not extubated yesterday
   due to pH 7.19 after one hour on PS.
   - Continue trials of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Try RSBI
   and SBT
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (very sedated)
   and minute volume requirement required to compensate for metabolic
   acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Cardiology was consulted last night;
   recommended digoxin loading.
   - Continue chemical cardioversion with amio, digoxin (dose by level
   given ARF)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated by MAP > 65
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - repeat  echo pending
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. There is a concern for
   fungal infection given pt
s prolonged abx course and frequent hospital
   stays. Yeast in urine and sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-23**] given initial decompensation. (Day 4
   today)
   - Surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   - ID denied empiric fluconazole; will f/u glucan and galactomannin and
   re-assess once data available.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Has
   received Bicarb. Likely to improve with diuresis.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal. Maintaining good UOP.
   - F/u nephrology recs
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15.5L positive).
   He was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.1.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**7-17**] (started [**4-21**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, TF with incr free water flushes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, lansoprazole,

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was intubated for respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There are concerns about mental status and minute volume requirements that may complicate extubation.
- Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which is likely due to septic state. There is also a possibility of distributive shock. The patient did not respond well to vasopressors like diltiazem or metoprolol. Cardiology recommended digoxin loading.
- Fever: The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and flagyl for medical management of ruptured appendicitis. The fever may be due to worsening of the appendicitis, aspiration pneumonitis, or another occult infection. The patient does not have an elevated WBC count and has been afebrile for 48 hours.
- Non-AG metabolic acidosis: The differential includes saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure, increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA. The patient received bicarbonate and is expected to improve with diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with ruptured appendicitis now with prolonged respiratory
   failure and hypotension with multiple contributing factors including
   sepsis, atrial-fibrillation, possible right heart compromise and
   intra-vascular depletion.  He, thanks to cardiology input, has had
   transfusion of 2 units PRBC and been able to have some significant
   weaning of pressors this morning
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Lasix gtt
   -PSV to wean down as tolerated
   -CXR without signficiant change
   -Secretions are limited
   -Continue with vanco/zosyn
10 day course
   -Start Fluconazole given clinical picture and B-glucan findings
   2)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Amiodarone
   -Coumadin
   -Digoxin
will need to clarify goals of the Digoxin
   -TEE and cardioversion if cardiology would feel we have a reasonable
   chance of success
urgency will depend on capacity to maintain pressors
   off.
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Will wean sedation as possible today
   -Likely multifactorial
   -Patient with increased alertness this morning which is encoura
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Bicarb with substantial improvement with support of renal function
   5)Hematuria-
   -Will need follow up evaluation and if clots worsening with obstruction
   will move to 3-way foley

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). More alert and tolerating PS
   15/5 better this AM than previously.
   - Continue trials of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat
   RSBI
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (gets agitated
   when awake and overbreathes the vent to RR of 40) and minute volume
   requirement required to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs last night per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. Discuss switching to PO amio and d/c
   digoxin
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue lasix (started yesterday [**4-26**]) with goal 1L negative today
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx
   courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN. Yeast in urine and
   sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 6
   today)
   - Start fluconazole today for fungemia
   - Surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Has
   received Bicarb. Likely to improve with diuresis.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal.
   - monitor closely as lasix is being given
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15L positive).  He
   was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.2.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**7-17**] (started [**4-22**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data; also adding
   fluconazole today
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is intubated for respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple medical complications including fever, non-AG metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, ruptured appendicitis, and pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors such as IVF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to mental status changes and increased minute volume requirements.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely due to septic state. There may be a component of cardiogenic shock, but the patient did not respond well to diltiazem or metoprolol. The mixed venous O2 saturation is high, suggesting distributive shock. The patient has been adequately fluid resuscitated, and weaning of levophed should be done carefully.
3. Fever: The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and flagyl for medical management of ruptured appendicitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, metabolic acidosis, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,303 mL and output of 4,700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,397 mL. The patient has received multiple medications, including amiodarone, fluconazole, warfarin, levophed, and midazolam. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for high potassium and low magnesium levels. The patient's renal function tests are abnormal with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient's imaging shows no significant abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to septic shock if not properly managed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. They are also experiencing acidosis, metabolic, hypernatremia, fever, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute impaired skin integrity, and a deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 101 bpm (normal range: 88-118 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 114/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 77. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 240, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 95 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -1.8 mEq/L.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 3,303 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 4,700 mL of urine. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are relatively stable, although there is a slight increase in heart rate during periods of weaning off from norepinephrine infusion.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The kidney function tests indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The liver function tests show elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T. The electrolyte levels are within normal ranges except for a slightly low potassium level (K+).

The patient's medication changes include starting fluconazole for a positive beta glucan, decreasing warfarin dosage due to drug interactions, and adjusting the amiodarone regimen. The patient's pain management involves midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Norepinephrine infusion has been weaned off but kept at a low dose overnight.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing management of their multiple medical complications. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and lab parameters is crucial to ensure proper treatment and prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Tolerating PS 12/5 well this
   morning, but NIF only -11.
   - Continue PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat RSBI/NIF
   daily-[**Hospital1 **].
   -
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs last night per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. Discuss switching to PO amio and d/c
   digoxin
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue lasix (started yesterday [**4-26**]) with goal 1L negative today
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequently intubated for respiratory failure.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IVF (intravenous fluids), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. Tolerating pressure support of 12/5 well this morning, but negative inspiratory force only -11. Continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) in anticipation of weaning off the ventilator. Repeat respiratory system compliance and negative inspiratory force daily.
2. Hemodynamics: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is most likely due to septic state. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed venous O2 saturation was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although the patient may have a component of cardiogenic shock, there was not much benefit from dopamine or metoprolol. TSH and FT4 levels are within normal range. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells last night per cardiology recommendation, who felt the patient was intravascularly volume depleted, and heart rate came down from 110s-130s to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Tolerating PS 12/5 well this
   morning, but NIF only -11.
   - Continue PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat RSBI/NIF
   daily-[**Hospital1 **].
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. d/c
d digoxin yesterday and amio
   converted from gtt to po yesterday.
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - minimize sedation as pt becomes hypotensive easily
   - d/c

He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation due to profound metabolic acidosis and agitation. It is important to continue weaning off the ventilator gradually, monitoring RSBI and NIF daily.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely due to septic state. Cardiology recommends continuing amiodarone and minimizing sedation as the patient becomes hypotensive easily.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient has a history of ruptured appendicitis, which is being managed medically with ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. The fever may be related to worsening of the appendicitis or other infectious processes. A CT scan showed no drainable abscesses, but the patient has a positive beta-glucan indicating possible fungal infection. Surveillance blood cultures should be obtained, and the patient should be started on fluconazole.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). More alert and tolerating PS
   15/5 better this AM than previously.
   - Continue trials of PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat
   RSBI
   - Issues that could complicate extubation: mental status (gets agitated
   when awake and overbreathes the vent to RR of 40) and minute volume
   requirement required to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs last night per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. Discuss switching to PO amio and d/c
   digoxin
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue lasix (started yesterday [**4-26**]) with goal 1L negative today
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 48 hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx
   courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN. Yeast in urine and
   sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 6
   today)
   - Start fluconazole today for fungemia
   - Surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis. Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.  Has
   received Bicarb. Likely to improve with diuresis.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - increase free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal.
   - monitor closely as lasix is being given
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15L positive).  He
   was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.2.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**7-17**] (started [**4-22**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data; also adding
   fluconazole today
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequently intubated for respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of IV fluid administration, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. He is tolerating pressure support ventilation better now and continues to be monitored for extubation readiness. However, mental status and minute volume requirements may complicate extubation.

Hemodynamically, the patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is most likely due to septic state. There is also a suspicion of pulmonary embolism based on an echocardiogram, but the patient is already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes a CT angiography of the chest.

The patient has a fever, possibly representing worsening of the ruptured appendix, aspiration pneumonia from intubation, or another occult infectious process. The patient has been on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for the ruptured appendix, but the B-glucan is positive, indicating possible fungemia. MRSA screen is positive as well.

The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to saline resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure, increased amino acids from total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Urine electrolytes with anion gap are present, and bicarbonate has been given. The hypernatremia is borderline high again, possibly due to tube feeds.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level stable at 1.8 and FENa at 1.26%, suggesting it is not entirely pre-renal. Lasix is being given to promote diuresis and close monitoring is required.

Anemia is present, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding from previous admissions and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Trending the anemia and conducting further tests, such as B12, folate, and iron levels, is recommended.

The patient has a right subclavian vein thrombosis, with significant erythema and edema of the right upper extremity. He has been on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and now started on warfarin.

Lastly, the patient has a ruptured appendicitis, medically managed with ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. His inflammatory markers are within normal limits, and CT abdomen shows no drainable fluid collection. Vanc/Zosyn and fluconazole have been added to the treatment regimen.

In summary, the patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, septic state with atrial fibrillation, possible pulmonary embolism, fever with suspicion of fung"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Tolerating PS 12/5 well this
   morning, but NIF only -11.
   - Continue PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat RSBI/NIF
   daily-[**Hospital1 **].
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. d/c
d digoxin yesterday and amio
   converted from gtt to po yesterday.
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - minimize sedation as pt becomes hypotensive easily
   - d/c
d lasix yesterday around midnight due to hypotension; continues
   to make good urine although lasix was discontinued; Will not restart
   lasix for now
   .
   # Abdominal pain: difficult to assess as pt
s sensorium is not
   completely clear, however it
s worrisome given his history of medically
   managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling well (1-3 times a day),
   C.diff neg x 1, and has no residuals with TF.
   - Hold TF for now
   - Check KUB for ileus or obstruction
   - Consider CT abd/pelvis if KUB negative and exam becomes more
   worrisome
   - check LFTs, [**Doctor First Name **], lipase
   - Consider [**Doctor First Name **] consult
   - recheck C. diff
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx
   courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN. Yeast in urine and
   sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 7
   today)
   - Started fluconazole yesterday for positive B-glucan
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   ..
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - continue free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15L positive).  He
   was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.1.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**8-16**] (started [**4-22**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data; also started Fluc
   yesterday
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, TF with incr free water flushes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line (from last admission; will not d/c at this time
   since other sites are inaccessible due to large clots), A-line; Will
   pull R fem CVC today as amio has now been converted from gtt to PO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of IV fluid administration, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and profound metabolic acidosis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but he has a history of septic state and may have a component of cardiogenic shock. He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells due to cardiology recommendations. The patient's abdominal pain is difficult to assess due to altered mental status, but it is worrisome given his history of medically managed ruptured appendicitis. He has been stooling well, with no evidence of infection. The patient's fever may be related to worsening appendicitis, aspiration pneumonia, or another occult infectious process. His B-glucan level is positive, indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient has hypernatremia, which is resolving but is borderline high again due to tube feeding. He also has acute-on-chronic renal failure,"

   Assessment and PlanThis is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p
   resection, prostate ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD,
   SVT, CHF and ruptured appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with
   hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Tolerating PS 12/5 well this
   morning, but NIF only -11.
   - Continue PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat RSBI/NIF
   daily-[**Hospital1 **].
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. d/c
d digoxin yesterday and amio
   converted from gtt to po yesterday.
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - minimize sedation as pt becomes hypotensive easily
   - d/c
d lasix yesterday around midnight due to hypotension; continues
   to make good urine although lasix was discontinued; Will not restart
   lasix for now
   .
   # Abdominal pain: difficult to assess as pt
s sensorium is not
   completely clear, however it
s worrisome given his history of medically
   managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling well (1-3 times a day),
   C.diff neg x 1, and has no residuals with TF.
   - Hold TF for now
   - Check KUB for ileus or obstruction
   - Consider CT abd/pelvis if KUB negative and exam becomes more
   worrisome
   - check LFTs, [**Doctor First Name **], lipase
   - Consider [**Doctor First Name **] consult
   - recheck C. diff
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx
   courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN. Yeast in urine and
   sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative [**4-25**]
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 7
   today)
   - Started fluconazole yesterday for positive B-glucan
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   ..
   # Hypernatremia: was resolving, however borderline high again in the
   setting of restarting tube feeds.
   - continue free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr stable at 1.8
 2.0. Patient now
   adequately fluid resuscitated. FENa 1.26%, so likely not entirely
   pre-renal.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable x 3+ days.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional (LOS 15L positive).  He
   was noted to be anemic with guaiac positive stools during last
   admission.  B12,  folate, & iron  within normal limits (though ferritin
   may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and should be rechecked).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**4-18**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**3-8**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT. INR therapeutic at 2.1.
   - Cont warfarin
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Will continue vanc/zosyn Day [**8-16**] (started [**4-22**]) for broad spectrum
   coverage in the absence of specific microbio data; also started Fluc
   yesterday
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] recs: OK to feed; TF started [**4-24**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including abdominal pain, fever, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, right subclavian vein thrombosis, ruptured appendicitis, pancreatic mass, and electrolyte imbalances. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, analgesics, and cardiac medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors including IVF (inhalation of gastric contents), atrial fibrillation with RVR, and profound metabolic acidosis. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well, but has poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Therefore, the plan is to continue PSV and repeat respiratory system assessment and NIF daily.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of acute illness. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is high, suggesting distributive shock. Although there may be a component of cardiogenic shock, the patient did not show much benefit from dopamine or metoprolol. The patient's heart rate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation support.

24-hour events:
- Levophed was weaned off at 4 pm and then restarted due to low systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
- The patient spent most of the day on pressure support (PS) and then switched to assist-control (AC) mode at night due to increased respiratory rate and fatigue.
- Abdominal pain has resolved, and ileus or obstruction is not present according to abdominal X-ray.
- The patient's fever has subsided, and he has been afebrile for the past 72 hours.
- The patient's renal function remains stable with a creatinine level of 1.8.
- He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, for possible infection.
- His electrolyte imbalances, such as hypernatremia, are being managed with free water boluses.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including IVF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and profound metabolic acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with prolonged hospital course in the setting of recent
   ruptured appy and now with prolonged course of respiratory failure.  He
   has had sepsis clearly and with prolonged course to resolve hemodynamic
   instability which has been complicated by a-fib with RVR which has
   shown increasing stability in the setting of Amiodarone and improved
   volume status.  He has had continued difficulty with ventilator weaning
   and this has been associated with rapid and shallow breathing which is
   concerning for significant muscle weakness.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has tolerance of PSV at 12/5 with RR=28-30.
   He has persistent compromise in large part attributable to
   weakness
this will be evaluated by repeat NIF testing.
   -Will move to [**6-7**] trail today and recheck ABG
   -ABG following [**6-7**] trial
   -Will move to minimize sedation and use of fentanyl patch is quite
   reasonable for pain
   2)Sepsis/Hypotension
   -Zosyn/Vanco
   -Levophed to wean as possible today
   -Cultures remain negative and fever controlled
   3)Atrial Fibrillation
   _Amiodarone to continue with good rate control effected
   -Anticoagulated for other reasons
   4)DVT-

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to recent ruptured appendix and prolonged respiratory failure. The patient has experienced sepsis and hemodynamic instability, which has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have difficulty with ventilator weaning, indicating a potential risk of persistent respiratory failure. This may be attributed to significant muscle weakness.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: Although the patient's fever is controlled and cultures remain negative, there is still a risk of sepsis-related hypotension. Appropriate antibiotic therapy with Zosyn and Vancomycin is being administered, and efforts will be made to wean off Levophed (a vasopressor) as possible.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is being treated with Amiodarone to maintain good rate control. Anticoagulation is also being continued due to other reasons.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin to prevent further clot formation.

Other ICU care includes nutrition support through Nutren Renal (Full), glycemic control, and appropriate prophylaxis measures such as stress ulcer prevention, deep vein thrombosis prevention, and ventilator"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16). Tolerating PS better each
   day, although RSBI was 158 early this morning.
   - Continue PSV in anticipation of weaning off vent. Repeat RSBI/NIF
   daily-[**Hospital1 **]. (RSBI 90-100 and NIF -18 during rounds)
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   - OOB into chair today (PT consult)
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. On PO amio now with rate mostly in
   90s-110s.
   - On very low dose levophed at this time (0.02 mcg/kg/min); suspect
   will be able to wean it off completely once all sedation is lifted.
   - No lasix at this time as pt auto-diuresing post-ATN
   .
   # Abdominal pain: difficult to assess as pt
s sensorium is not
   completely clear, however it
s worrisome given his history of medically
   managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling well (1-3 times a day),
   C.diff neg x 1, and has no residuals with TF. KUB neg for ileus or
   obstruction. LFTs, amylase, lipase all WNL. Repeat C-diff pending.
   - Will hold off on further investigation for now; talk to patient once
   extubated for better history. The next step would be CT of abdomen and
   pelvis.
   - Continue TF as tolerating well with no residuals.
   .
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious
   process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC count and
   has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may not be able to mount a robust
   inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill
   state. CT negative for any drainable abscesses. B-glucan floridly
   positive (>500) which is not surprising given pt
s prolonged abx

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix.
- He was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and subsequently intubated for respiratory failure.
- The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well each day, but has not yet been extubated due to barriers such as anxiety and poor negative inspiratory force (NIF).
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of acute illness in the past. He may have a component of cardiogenic shock, but did not benefit much from diltiazem or metoprolol. His TSH and FT4 levels are within normal limits.
- The patient has been systemically anticoagulated, and an echocardiogram is highly suspicious for pulmonary embolism (PE), but he is already anticoagulated and has renal failure precluding a CT angiogram (CTA) chest.
- The patient is on very low-dose levophed and is expected to be able to wean it off once all sedation is lifted.
- He is not receiving lasix at this time as he is autodiuresing post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient has abdominal pain, which is difficult to assess due to his altered mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16).   Patient tolerated PSV this
   morning with NIF +28.
   - attempt extubation today
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   - OOB into chair today (PT consult)
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.  Levophed off.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. On PO amio now with rate mostly in
   90s-110s.
   - No lasix at this time as pt auto-diuresing post-ATN
   - pt. was on metoprolol as an outpatient for rate control, can consider
   restarting as BP improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis with course to end on [**4-22**].  Fever may represent
   worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation
   vs. other occult infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not
   have an elevated WBC count and has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may
   not be able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to older age
   and general chronically ill state. CT negative for any drainable
   abscesses. B-glucan floridly positive (>500) which is not surprising
   given pt
s prolonged abx courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN.
   Yeast in urine and sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative x 2
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 9
   today). Plan for 10 day total course
   - On day 4 of fluconazole which was started for positive B-glucan (D1 =
   [**4-27**]).  Plan for 7 day course?
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Absent today.  Previously was difficult to assess as
   pt
s sensorium was not completely clear, however it was worrisome given
   his history of medically managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling
   well (1-3 times a day), C.diff neg x 2, and has no residuals with TF.
   KUB neg for ileus or obstruction. LFTs, amylase, lipase all WNL.
   - Will hold off on further investigation for now; talk to patient once
   extubated for better history. The next step would be CT of abdomen and
   pelvis.
   - Continue TF as tolerating well with no residuals.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: better with D5W.
   - hold off on further D5W infusions; give PRN after checking PM lytes
   - continue free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving. Cr better this morning at
   1.3. UOP very good with likely post-ATN diuresis.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable after 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**].   B12,  folate, & iron  within normal
   limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and
   should be rechecked once pt recovers from acute illness).  [**Month (only) 11**] be

   off and on (with anticoagulation/INR 2.2)
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   - monitor hematuria
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now on coumadin
   with INR therapeutic 2.0 today (goal [**3-8**]). Left arm without any DVT.
   - increase warfarin again to 2.5 mg as INR barely therapeutic
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Vanc/zosyn and fluconazole as above
   - TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, TF with free water flushes held pending
   extubation.  Will try on clears later today if successfully extubated
   and has a good gag.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure, which is likely a combination of intravenous fluids (IVF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and profound metabolic acidosis. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) this morning with negative inspiratory force (NIF) +28. The plan is to attempt extubation today, but barriers include the patient's anxiety level and poor NIF (weakness).

2. Hemodynamics: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. The mixed venous O2 saturation was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although the patient may have a component of cardiogenic shock, they did not see much benefit from diltiazem (dilt) gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. The patient's heart rate came down from 110s-130s to 90-100s after being transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) per cardiology recommendation. An echocardiogram (Echo) was highly suspicious for pulmonary embolism (PE), but the patient is already systemically anticoagulated and has renal failure precluding computed tomography angiography (CTA) chest. Levophed was turned off.

3. Fever: The patient had been on ciprofloxacin/flagyl for medical management of a ruptured appendix with course to end on [**4-22**]. Fever may represent worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. other occult infectious process. Notably, the patient does not have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and has been afebrile for 72+ hours. The patient may not be able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to older age and general chronically ill state. A CT scan was negative for any drainable abscesses. Beta-glucan was floridly positive (>500), which is not surprising given the patient's prolonged antibiotic courses, frequent hospital stays, and history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Yeast in urine and sputum were noted. MRSA screen was positive.

4. Abdominal pain: Absent today. Previously, it was difficult to assess as the patient's sensorium was not completely clear, however it was worrisome given his history of medically managed ruptured appendix. The patient is stooling well (1-3 times a day), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) negative x 2, and has no residuals with tube feeding (TF). Kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) were negative for ileus or obstruction. Liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lip"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with prolonged hospital course in the setting of recent
   ruptured appy and now with prolonged course of respiratory failure.  He
   has had sepsis clearly and with prolonged course to resolve hemodynamic
   instability which has been complicated by a-fib with RVR which has
   shown increasing stability in the setting of Amiodarone and improved
   volume status.  He has had continued difficulty with ventilator weaning
   and this has been associated with rapid and shallow breathing which is
   concerning for significant muscle weakness.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure
   - appears comfortable on PSV 5/5 with good mechanics and ABG, awake,
   alert.
   - will extubate
    2)Sepsis/Hypotension
   - Zosyn/Vanco day [**10-13**] + fluconazole 4/7 days
   - off pressors
   - Cultures remain negative and fever controlled
    3)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Amiodarone to continue with good rate control
   -Anticoagulated for UE DVT
    4)DVT-
   -Coumadin continuing as anticoagulation given extensive clot in right
   SCV
   - keep INR 2-2.5 given hematuria
   5) Renal failure
   - improving, creat at 1.3
   6) Pancreatic Mass
 likely benign, followed in past

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They were successfully extubated today and their Coumadin dose was increased to 2.5 mg daily, with an INR of 2.3 this morning. The patient's sodium level was corrected with a D5W 500cc bolus. They have been receiving various antibiotics since April 29th, including fluconazole, vancomycin, piperacillin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 to 145/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set volume of 500 mL and a spontaneous volume of 380 mL. Other parameters include a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 92, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 36 cmH2O, negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -27 cmH2O, and minute ventilation (Ve) of 12.3 L/min. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 232.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic assessment. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 270 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 115 mEq/L, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated potassium (K+) of 28.3%. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include acidosis, metabolic; deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity; sepsis without organ dysfunction; fever; hypernatremia; renal failure, chronic; atrial fibrillation; acute respiratory failure (not ARDS); impaired skin integrity.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines such as a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16).   Patient tolerated PSV this
   morning with NIF +28.
   - attempt extubation today
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   - OOB into chair today (PT consult)
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.  Levophed off.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. On PO amio now with rate mostly in
   90s-110s.
   - No lasix at this time as pt auto-diuresing post-ATN
   - pt. was on metoprolol as an outpatient for rate control, can consider
   restarting as BP improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis with course to end on [**4-22**].  Fever may represent
   worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation
   vs. other occult infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not
   have an elevated WBC count and has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may
   not be able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to older age
   and general chronically ill state. CT negative for any drainable
   abscesses. B-glucan floridly positive (>500) which is not surprising
   given pt
s prolonged abx courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN.
   Yeast in urine and sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative x 2
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 9
   today). Plan for 10 day total course
   - On day 4 of fluconazole which was started for positive B-glucan (D1 =
   [**4-27**]).  Plan for 7 day course?
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Absent today.  Previously was difficult to assess as
   pt
s sensorium was not completely clear, however it was worrisome given
   his history of medically managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling
   well (1-3 times a day), C.diff neg x 2, and has no residuals with TF.
   KUB neg for ileus or obstruction. LFTs, amylase, lipase all WNL.
   - Will hold off on further investigation for now; talk to patient once
   extubated for better history. The next step would be CT of abdomen and
   pelvis.
   - Continue TF as tolerating well with no residuals.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: better with D5W.
   - hold off on further D5W infusions; give PRN after checking PM lytes
   - continue free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving. Cr better this morning at
   1.3. UOP very good with likely post-ATN diuresis.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable after 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**].   B12,  folate, & iron  within normal
   limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and
   should be rechecked once pt recovers from acute illness).  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   partially related to CKD. Also having low grade hematuria (pink urine)
   off and on (with anticoagulation/INR 2.2)
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   - monitor hematuria
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now on coumadin
   with INR therapeutic 2.0 today (goal [**3-8**]). Left arm without any DVT.
   - increase warfarin again to 2.5 mg as INR barely therapeutic
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Vanc/zosyn and fluconazole as above
   - TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, TF with free water flushes held pending
   extubation.  Will try on clears later today if successfully extubated
   and has a good gag.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line (from last admission; will not d/c at this time
   since other sites are inaccessible due to large clots), A-line; R fem
   CVC pulled [**4-28**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, SVT, CHF, and ruptured appendix. The patient was admitted with hypernatremia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was intubated for respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure. The barriers to extubation include anxiety level and poor negative inspiratory force (NIF).
2. Hemodynamics: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which is likely due to septic state. There is a concern for distributive shock, and the patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
3. Fever: The patient had been on ciprofloxacin and flagyl for medical management of ruptured appendicitis. The fever may represent worsening of this process, aspiration pneumonitis from intubation, or other occult infectious process. The patient does not have an elevated WBC count, and has been afebrile for 72+ hours.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient previously had abdominal pain, but it is now absent. This could be due to the resolution of the ruptured appendix or other abdominal issues.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are improving with D5W.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, prostate cancer, COPD, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and ruptured appendix. He was admitted with hypernatremia and respiratory failure, for which he was intubated. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he was successfully extubated yesterday. He is now breathing well on a nasal cannula with 50% FiO2.

The patient's hemodynamics are better controlled, but he still has a low heart rate. The plan is to continue administering amiodarone to control his heart rate. No lasix is needed at this time as the patient is auto-diuresing post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient had a fever, which may represent worsening of a ruptured appendicitis, aspiration pneumonitis, or another occult infectious process. The B-glucan test was positive, indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient also has yeast in his urine and sputum, and a MRSA screen is positive. CT abdomen shows no drainable fluid collection. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn for the infection. Fluconazole will be discontinued soon if the patient continues to do well.

The patient had hypernatremia, which is improving with D5W. Further D5W infusions will be given PRN after checking potassium levels. The patient will also receive"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR and was intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16).   Patient tolerated PSV this
   morning with NIF +28.
   - attempt extubation today
   - Barriers to extubation: anxiety level, poor NIF (weakness).
   - OOB into chair today (PT consult)
   .
   # Hemodynamics: A fib with RVR most likely due to septic state. Pt has
   h/o afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past. Mixed
   venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock. Although pt may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock, pt did not see much benefit from
   dilt gtt or metoprolol PO/IV. Appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim
   (14.6->28.5). TSH, FT4 WNL. Was transfused 2 u pRBCs 3/24 per
   Cardiology who felt pt was intravascularly volume depleted, and HR came
   down from 110s-130s to 90-100s. Echo highly suspicious for PE, however
   pt already systemically anticoagulated and renal failure precludes CTA
   chest.  Levophed off.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs. On PO amio now with rate mostly in
   90s-110s.
   - No lasix at this time as pt auto-diuresing post-ATN
   - pt. was on metoprolol as an outpatient for rate control, can consider
   restarting as BP improves
   .
   # Fever: Patient had been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis with course to end on [**4-22**].  Fever may represent
   worsening of this process vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation
   vs. other occult infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not
   have an elevated WBC count and has been afebrile x 72+ hours. Pt may
   not be able to mount a robust inflammatory response due to older age
   and general chronically ill state. CT negative for any drainable
   abscesses. B-glucan floridly positive (>500) which is not surprising
   given pt
s prolonged abx courses, frequent hospital stays and h/o TPN.
   Yeast in urine and sputum. MRSA screen pos.
   - C. diff negative x 2
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn started [**4-22**] given initial decompensation. (Day 9
   today). Plan for 10 day total course
   - On day 4 of fluconazole which was started for positive B-glucan (D1 =
   [**4-27**]).  Plan for 7 day course?
   - f/u pending microbio studies.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Absent today.  Previously was difficult to assess as
   pt
s sensorium was not completely clear, however it was worrisome given
   his history of medically managed ruptured appendicitis. Pt is stooling
   well (1-3 times a day), C.diff neg x 2, and has no residuals with TF.
   KUB neg for ileus or obstruction. LFTs, amylase, lipase all WNL.
   - Will hold off on further investigation for now; talk to patient once
   extubated for better history. The next step would be CT of abdomen and
   pelvis.
   - Continue TF as tolerating well with no residuals.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: better with D5W.
   - hold off on further D5W infusions; give PRN after checking PM lytes
   - continue free water boluses to 250 cc q4h
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving. Cr better this morning at
   1.3. UOP very good with likely post-ATN diuresis.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Currently in the high20s,
   stable after 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**].   B12,  folate, & iron  within normal
   limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant and
   should be rechecked once pt recovers from acute illness).  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   partially related to CKD. Also having low grade hematuria (pink urine)
   off and on (with anticoagulation/INR 2.2)
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   - monitor hematuria
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now on coumadin
   with INR therapeutic 2.0 today (goal [**3-8**]). Left arm without any DVT.
   - increase warfarin again to 2.5 mg as INR barely therapeutic
   - f/u INR given concurrent administration of amiodarone and fluconazole
   .
   # Ruptured appendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  Rec'd one dose of
   vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  CT abdomen showing
   no drainable fluid collection
   - Vanc/zosyn and fluconazole as above
   - TF started [**4-24**]
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, TF with free water flushes held pending
   extubation.  Will try on clears later today if successfully extubated
   and has a good gag.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with warfarin, lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with prolonged hospital course in the setting of recent
   ruptured appy and now with prolonged course of respiratory failure.  He
   has had sepsis clearly and with prolonged course to resolve hemodynamic
   instability which has been complicated by a-fib with RVR which has
   shown increasing stability in the setting of Amiodarone and improved
   volume status.  He has had continued difficulty with ventilator weaning
   and this has been associated with rapid and shallow breathing which is
   concerning for significant muscle weakness.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure
   - extubated successfully, encourage incentive spirometry, OOB to chair,
   chest PT prn.
    2)ID
   - sepsis resolved, - Zosyn/Vanco day [**11-12**] + fluconazole 5/7 days
   - Cultures remain negative and fever controlled
    3)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Amiodarone to continue for rate control
   -Anticoagulated for UE DVT
   4)DVT- coumadin continuing as anticoagulation given extensive clot in
   right SCV
   - keep INR 2-2.5 given hematuria
   5) Renal failure - improving, creat at 1.3
   6) Pancreatic Mass
 likely benign, followed in past
   7) Hypertension
 will add back metoprolol
   8) Hypernatremia
 being corrected with IVF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 81-year-old male, has been admitted to the ICU with a prolonged hospital course following a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (APP) and respiratory failure. He has a history of sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, renal failure, and a pancreatic mass. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure ranging from 137/70 mmHg to 145/89 mmHg, heart rate of 106 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,280 mL, output of 3,105 mL, and a negative balance of -1,825 mL. The patient is currently extubated and using an incentive spirometer. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The assessment and plan include treatment for acute respiratory failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, DVT, renal failure, pancreatic mass, hypertension, and hypernatremia. The patient will continue to receive IV fluids, antibiotics, anticoagulation, and other medications"
