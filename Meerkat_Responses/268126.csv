   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep,
   Hep B and C, now with hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - Sputum culture pending
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given fluid overload and
   hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, will need to give judiciously given renal failure
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and likely HAP
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Discussed with
   surgery this morning and percutaneous decompression not felt to be an
   option.  If patient decompensates again, surgery may be considered as
   patient failing medical management, but with high likelihood of death
   also.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with PO contrast to assess for
   obstruction/ileus
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - foley placed on [**2-29**] and no urine output overnight despite IVF.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Albumin as needed for intravascular volume resuscitation/HRS therapy
   as needed dodrine before dialysis to help with hypotension
   - Plan for HD or CVVH on [**3-2**]
   - Will check bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO vanc and IV flagyl given severity of colitis.
   Today is day 11 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be improving.
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate.
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable off heparin products.
   - Send HIT ab
   - Continue to hold on heparin
   - Pneumoboots for DVT ppx, INR 2.0 today
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now
   - Meds via OGT
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole, on lactulose
   .
   # Access: R CVL placed [**2-20**], will need to consider replacing, L HD
   catheter, consider PICC placement tomorrow to replace R CVL.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute renal failure (ARF), cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and C, alcohol hepatitis, and a history of ileus/possible small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration. He also has hypotension that is being managed with vasopressors and fluid boluses. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. He is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure and to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, which is being treated with oral vancomycin and metronidazole. He also has a coagulopathy with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), possibly due to liver disease and malnutrition. The patient's platelet count is low, and he has been treated with vitamin K without significant improvement. A HIT antibody assay has been sent, and heparin products have been held.

Other issues include delirium, likely multifactorial in origin, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). There is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of acute renal failure, cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration and was intubated. The patient has multiple comorbidities including delirium, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, hematochezia, Clostridium difficile colitis, afferent loop syndrome/ileus versus small bowel obstruction, air near the tail of the pancreas, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, morphine sulfate, lactulose, and albumin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not improve with ventilation support and treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support indicates a potential for further deterioration in organ perfusion and function.
3. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate if not adequately supported with dialysis and careful fluid management.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient's colitis may progress and lead to severe complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation if appropriate antibiotic therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep,
   Hep B and C, now with hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well on AC.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - Sputum culture now
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - A-line
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, will need to give judiciously given renal failure
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and likely HAP
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Albumin as needed for intravascular volume resuscitation/HRS therapy
   as needed dodrine before dialysis to help with hypotension
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO vanc and IV flagyl given severity of colitis.
   Today is day 11 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be improving.
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Per surgery, they
   had considered percutaneous decompression, but given decompensation,
   this was not performed.  Patient vomiting copious amounts
   peri-intubation and continues to have significant OG output.  It is not
   entirely clear why NGT was not placed for decompression prior.
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - Surgery recs - will discuss possible percutaneous drainage of
   afferent loop with team
   - KUB now
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only

   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate.
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Complicated history 60 yr old with DM, ARF, question of afferent loop
   syndrome admitted to MICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   1- Respiratory failure - definite aspiration peri-intubation and I
   suspect this is what resulted in initial respiratory symptoms
   superimposed by volume overload from anuric ARF. Will treat as HAP +
   aspiration. Agree with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Will keep on ventilator,
   wean FiO2, RSBI/SBT daily. Will need fluid removal by dialysis to help
   with extubation.
   2 - Vomiting/Ileus
 will check CT [**Last Name (un) **] with PO contrast to assess for
   SBO. Previous surgical notes suggest afferent limb syndrome. OG to
   suction. Continue TPN
   3 - Septic shock/hypotension
 likely sepsis given SBP, cdiff and now
   aspiration pneumonia. On levophed, would give small bolus IVF if needed
   for hypotension.
   4 - ARF - ? ATN, anuric. Will likely start CVVH tomorrow AM.
   - will check bladder pressure
   5
 Anemia/thrombocytopenia
   6 - C diff
 being treated with PO vanc/IV flagyl
   7 - DM

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a complicated medical history including cirrhosis, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pancreatitis, and recent admission for bowel obstruction. The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated due to copious vomiting and significant aspiration. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 117/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's neurological status is sedated and not fully assessed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 179 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate an elevated lactate level, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient has experienced acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration during intubation. He will be treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration. The ventilator settings will be adjusted to wean FiO2 and assess readiness for extubation.
2. Vomiting/Ileus - The patient has a history of vomiting and possible ileus"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced (HIT, HITT): The patient has been diagnosed with HIT, a serious complication caused by an allergic reaction to heparin, a blood thinner commonly used in hospital settings.

2. Renal failure, acute (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This could potentially lead to further kidney damage or the need for dialysis.

3. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, indicating respiratory failure. The underlying cause is not specified as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it is mentioned that the patient has a decreased respiratory system compliance.

4. Gastrointestinal bleed, lower (GI bleed): The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to their current condition.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has a history of C. diff infection, a bacterial infection commonly associated with antibiotic use.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be related to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

7. Hepatitis: The patient has a history of hepatitis, although the specific type is not mentioned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to an unknown cause (not ARDS). The patient has been mechanically ventilated since admission. He has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), acute renal failure, lower gastrointestinal bleed, and acute hepatitis. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 79/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. The patient is sedated and in respiratory distress prior to intubation. Physical examination findings include sclera icteric, tachycardia, coarse breath sounds bilaterally with loud upper airway sounds, and trace lower extremity edema. Lab results show thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient has been receiving norepinephrine for hypotension, midazolam for sedation, and TPN with lipids. The patient's current medical conditions include HIT, ascites, Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and acute hepatitis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has tested positive for HIT, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by an immune response to heparin leading to low platelet count and increased risk of thrombosis.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as CVVH or HD.
4. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed, which could recur or worsen, leading to significant blood loss and hypotension.
5. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis and may require treatment with antibiotics effective against C. difficile.
6. Hepatitis: The patient has acute hepatitis, which may progress to fulminant hepatic failure if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension that requires continuous monitoring and management.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be considered to prevent DVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - Sputum culture pending
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given fluid overload and
   hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, will need to give judiciously given renal failure
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and likely HAP
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Discussed with
   surgery this morning and percutaneous decompression not felt to be an
   option.  If patient decompensates again, surgery may be considered as
   patient failing medical management, but with high likelihood of death
   also.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with PO contrast to assess for
   obstruction/ileus
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - foley placed on [**2-29**] and no urine output overnight despite IVF.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Albumin as needed for intravascular volume resuscitation/HRS therapy
   as needed dodrine before dialysis to help with hypotension
   - Plan for HD or CVVH on [**3-2**]
   - Will check bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO vanc and IV flagyl given severity of colitis.
   Today is day 11 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be improving.
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate.
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable off heparin products.
   - Send HIT ab
   - Continue to hold on heparin
   - Pneumoboots for DVT ppx, INR 2.0 today
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now
   - Meds via OGT
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole, on lactulose
   .
   # Access: R CVL placed [**2-20**], will need to consider replacing, L HD
   catheter, consider PICC placement tomorrow to replace R CVL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, Hepatitis B and C, diabetes mellitus type 2, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which was likely caused by aspiration during intubation. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and sepsis.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure. He has fluid overload and is receiving diuretics to manage this. The patient has a history of ileus versus small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is currently not a surgical candidate. Surgery has recommended percutaneous decompression, but it is not being pursued at this time.

The patient has oliguric acute renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. He has thrombocytopenia and is off heparin products. He also has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR and is receiving vitamin K supplementation.

The patient's delirium is multifactorial and includes uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and severe infection. He is receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis and HAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum culture pending
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given fluid overload and
   hypotension requiring pressors, though will give trial of pressure
   support.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - check central venous sat to help determine if hypovolemia/cardiogenic
   vs. sepsis as cause of hypotension
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with PO contrast to assess for
   obstruction/ileus though imaging at this point may not be very helpful
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   - seriel abd pressures
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for CVVH today
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO vanc and IV flagyl given severity of colitis.
   Today is day 11 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be improving.
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - start PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate.
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue [**Last Name (LF) 1565**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] need to be increased today
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now
   - Meds via OGT
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole, on lactulose
   .
   # Access: R CVL placed [**2-20**], will need to consider replacing, L HD
   catheter, consider PICC placement tomorrow to replace R CVL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, cirrhosis, Hepatitis B and C, colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, ileus versus small bowel obstruction, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, delirium, and hematochezia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He requires pressors to maintain blood pressure and has ongoing issues with fluid overload, renal failure, infection, and liver dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. This may indicate ongoing sepsis or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and a positive HIT antibody. This could lead to increased bleeding risk, particularly if the platelet count drops further or if there is a need for invasive procedures.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to multiple factors including uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and severe infection. Delirium can increase the risk of complications such as falls, aspiration, and pressure ulcers.
5. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with oliguria (low urine output). There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function or the development of complications such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, and fluid overload.
6. C. difficile colitis: The patient has ongoing C. difficile colitis, which can lead to worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased risk of perforation or fulminant colitis.
7. Ileus vs small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of ileus versus small bowel obstruction, which may lead to ongoing bowel distension, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Overall, the patient has multiple complex medical issues that require careful management to prevent further deterioration and complications."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure (ARF), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis B and C, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration and subsequent acute decompensation.

The patient's hypotension is managed with vasopressors, and fluid boluses are given as needed. There is a concern for sepsis, possibly due to peritonitis, C. diff, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs. small bowel obstruction (SBO) is another concern, with surgery considering percutaneous decompression not a good option. If the patient decompensates again, surgery may be considered, but with a high likelihood of death.

Oliguric acute renal failure is present, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal azotemia. The patient is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will have a new IR-guided hemodialysis line placed.

Thrombocytopenia is a concern, with a question of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). A serotonin assay has been sent to confirm the diagnosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum culture final results, currently yeast
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once HD able to take
   off fluid
   - will obtain blood cultures today for surveillance, consider
   antifungal if blood cultures indicate yeast as is seen in current
   sputum cultures.
   - Cont daily trial of pressure support at 15/10.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal decrease in
   required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - HD today, will plan for likely zero UF.
   - continue check central venous sat, yesterday [**3-2**] was 70, to help
   determine if hypovolemia/cardiogenic vs. sepsis as cause of hypotension
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen much more tender
   this morning, no recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - d/c lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan to assess UOP status in setting of unclear
   interpretation of elevated bladder pressures
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   - seriel abd pressures, last bladder pressure 22 and 24, unable to
   interpret given body habitus, fluid overload.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for CVVH today once new IR guided HD line placed
   - d/c midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/versed due to
   increase in abd tenderness
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today [**3-3**] is day 12 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be
   improving.  Not producing BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   - would consider IVIG for c.diff if next stool sample still c.diff
   positive
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.3, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed.  Will place insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now, will add insulin to TPN
   - Meds via OGT

   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, hepatitis B and C, alcoholic hepatitis, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. The patient also has hypotension requiring vasopressor support, and there are concerns about possible bowel obstruction or ileus. Other medical complications include thrombocytopenia with a positive HIT antibody, delirium, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating ongoing instability in his hemodynamic status.
3. Bowel obstruction or ileus: The patient's abdominal tenderness and lack of bowel movement raise concerns about potential bowel obstruction or ileus, which may require surgical intervention if medical management fails.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he has a positive HIT antibody. This increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the HIT antibody is confirmed to be true positive.
5. Delirium: The patient is at risk of ongoing cognitive impairment and delirium due to multiple contributing factors such as uremia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum culture final results, currently yeast
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once HD able to take
   off fluid
   - Cont daily trial of pressure support.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - check central venous sat, yesterday [**3-2**] was 70, to help determine if
   hypovolemia/cardiogenic vs. sepsis as cause of hypotension
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   - seriel abd pressures, last bladder pressure 22 and 24, unable to
   interpret given body habitus, fluid overload.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for CVVH today once new IR guided HD line placed
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   - minimize fentanyl for oversedation.
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today [**3-3**] is day 12 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be
   improving.  Not producing BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed.
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now
   - Meds via OGT
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole, on lactulose
   .
   # Access: R CVL placed [**2-20**], will need to replace L HD catheter today
   with IR, consider PICC placement tomorrow to replace R CVL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute renal failure (ARF), cirrhosis, Hepatitis B and C, and colon cancer. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration and subsequent intubation. The patient has a history of ileus versus obstruction, significant gastric output, and fluid overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving vasopressors for hypotension, and undergoing hemodialysis (HD) for ARF and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a positive HIT antibody test, delirium, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and a history of hematochezia. He has air near the tail of the pancreas, coagulopathy with an elevated INR, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's nutritional support is provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilatory support is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may progress to cardiogenic shock or septic shock, requiring continuous monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status. Vasopressor therapy may need to be adjusted or additional interventions considered.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF may"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated and satting well.
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum culture final results, currently yeast
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once HD able to take
   off fluid
   - Cont daily trial of pressure support.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - check central venous sat, yesterday [**3-2**] was 70, to help determine if
   hypovolemia/cardiogenic vs. sepsis as cause of hypotension
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   - seriel abd pressures, last bladder pressure 22 and 24, unable to
   interpret given body habitus, fluid overload.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for CVVH today once new IR guided HD line placed
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue lactulose 30 mL TID
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/midazolam ->
   consider changing to propofol if BP tolerates.
   - minimize fentanyl for oversedation.
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today [**3-3**] is day 12 of antibiotics. Per report, appears to be
   improving.  Not producing BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl to complete at least a 14 day course
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.0, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed.
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now
   - Meds via OGT
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR,
   lansoprazole, on lactulose
   .
   # Access: R CVL placed [**2-20**], will need to replace L HD catheter today
   with IR, consider PICC placement tomorrow to replace R CVL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of acute renal failure, cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, alcohol hepatitis, and recent hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent surgery but is now in the ICU due to multiple complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced a rapid decline and required intubation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and being weaned as tolerated. The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be due to aspiration. 
2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive after intubation and requires vasoactive medications to maintain adequate blood pressure. This could be related to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. 
3. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including peritonitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover these infections. 
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause. 
5. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury with oliguria (low urine output). Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis (HD) or continuous"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, there are several notable events that occurred within the 24-hour period.

The patient underwent line changes, with the central venous catheter (CVC) being placed on the left side and the hemodialysis catheter on the right side. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was also initiated in the evening.

A Foley catheter was changed due to concerns about leaking and possible residual volume in the bladder. Levophed was titrated up to 0.2 mcg/kg/min following the initiation of CVVH.

Blood cultures were taken multiple times on [**2172-3-3**] at 10:00 AM, 10:10 AM, and 10:15 AM. A fungal isolator was also mentioned.

The multi-lumen catheter was stopped at 03:30 PM on [**2172-3-3**] and restarted at 04:00 PM on the same day. The dialysis catheter was also stopped at 03:30 PM and restarted at 04:00 PM.

The patient has allergies to heparin agents and is HIT positive. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on [**2172-3-3**] at 08:00 AM, Cefipime on [**2172-3-3**] at 04:00 PM, and Metronidazole on [**2172-3-4**] at 03:56 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Fentanyl, Midazolam (Versed), and Norepinephrine. Other ICU medications and medical history are noted, but no significant changes have been made.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. Flowsheet data as of [**2172-3-4**] 07:25 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is sedated, hypoxic, and in respiratory distress prior to intubation. The patient has sclera icteric, dry mouth, poor dentition, supple neck, and no elevated jugular venous pressure. Lung sounds are coarse bilaterally with loud upper airway sounds, no appreciable wheezes or rales. The patient is tachycardic with normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is distended but soft, with distant bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. There is 1+ right lower extremity edema and trace left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab results, including electrolyte imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on
   ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated, trial of pressure support
   - f/u culture final results
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once CVVH able to
   take off fluid
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal
   decrease in required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses if needed, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - cont CVVH today, will plan for likely zero UF.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with increased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days leading to this
   rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum culture final results, currently yeast
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once HD able to take
   off fluid
   - will obtain blood cultures today for surveillance, consider
   antifungal if blood cultures indicate yeast as is seen in current
   sputum cultures.
   - Cont daily trial of pressure support at 15/10.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Is on midodrine at HD for hypotension
   as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal decrease in
   required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses prn, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - HD today, will plan for likely zero UF.
   - continue check central venous sat, yesterday [**3-2**] was 70, to help
   determine if hypovolemia/cardiogenic vs. sepsis as cause of hypotension
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen much more tender
   this morning, no recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - d/c lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan to assess UOP status in setting of unclear
   interpretation of elevated bladder pressures
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   - seriel abd pressures, last bladder pressure 22 and 24, unable to
   interpret given body habitus, fluid overload.
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.

   recommendations.
   - Plan for CVVH today once new IR guided HD line placed
   - d/c midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban

   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue HD for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/versed due to
   increase in abd tenderness

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of acute renal failure (ARF), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, alcoholic hepatitis, Hepatitis B and C, who is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is stable on the ventilator. The medical team suspects that the respiratory failure may have been caused by aspiration. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, afferent loop syndrome/ileus versus small bowel obstruction (SBO), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), delirium, hematochezia (bloody stools), C. diff colitis, air near the tail of the pancreas, coagulopathy (elevated INR), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

The patient has undergone several interventions, including line changes, initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and administration of antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires the use of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. 

The patient's blood cultures have shown the presence of yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection. The medical team is considering the possibility of antifungal treatment. 

The patient's abdominal exam shows signs of tenderness and distention, which raises concerns about ongoing ileus or SBO. Surgical intervention"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on
   ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated on pressure support
   - f/u cultures
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean sedation today given need for patient to be still
   for CVVH
   - will attempt to slowly diurese with CVVH to remove fluid, however BP
   may not tolerate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal
   decrease in required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses if needed, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - cont CVVH today, will plan for some net removal of fluid.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with increased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options, including initiating feeds today
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan yesterday showed 20, cont to monitor
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for continued CVVH today
   - holding on midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay (pending)
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue CVVH for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; however, currently on fent/versed
   due to increase in abd tenderness and need for patient to remain still
   for CVVH
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today ([**3-5**]) is day 14 of antibiotics. Still not producing
   BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl (now has had a 14 day course)
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   - would consider IVIG for c.diff if next stool sample still c.diff
   positive
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.3, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed. insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now, insulin in TPN
   - Meds via IV
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR, PPI
   .
   # Access: L-CVL placed [**3-4**] (originally R-sided placed on [**2-20**]).  R-HD

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including acute respiratory failure, chronic liver disease, Hepatitis B and C, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration, possibly exacerbated by ileus or small bowel obstruction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and will be weaned as tolerated.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been treated with vasopressors (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram may be considered if the hypotension persists.

3. Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a questionable diagnosis of afferent loop syndrome or ileus/SBO. Surgical intervention may be considered if the patient's condition deteriorates.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which may be related to Hepatitis C treatment or a false positive HIT antibody. A serotonin assay is pending to further evaluate the cause of thrombocytopenia.

5. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, which may be multifactorial due to uremia, hepatic encephalopathy"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on
   ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated, trial of pressure support
   - f/u culture final results
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean from ventilator today given continued fluid overload
   and hypotension requiring pressors, will reassess once CVVH able to
   take off fluid
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal
   decrease in required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses if needed, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - cont CVVH today, will plan for likely zero UF.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with increased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
 their input appreciated
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan yesterday showed 18, cont to monitor
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for continued CVVH today
   - holding on midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue CVVH for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; currently on fent/versed due to
   increase in abd tenderness

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and stable on the ventilator. There is a concern for aspiration, as evidenced by the copious emesis during intubation and ongoing significant output of gastric contents. The patient may develop infiltrates or pneumonitis due to aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite fluid boluses, requiring the use of vasopressors like levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. This could be due to septic shock or renal failure.

3. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pre-renal azotemia. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and will continue with this treatment.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a dropping platelet count and a positive HIT antibody. There is a question of whether this is a false positive result due to hemodialysis. Further evaluation with a serotonin assay is needed.

5. Delirium: The patient is unable to be assessed for delirium, but it has been an ongoing problem on the floor. It may be multifactorial, including uremia, hepatic en"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of several medical conditions including thrombocytopenia induced by heparin (HIT), ascites, Clostridium difficile infection, type II diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis other, hypertension, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has been receiving various medications and treatments. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not addressed appropriately.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a risk of worsening renal function if the treatment is not effective or if there are complications during the CVVH procedure.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to his medical conditions and treatments, increasing the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or Clostridium difficile infection recurrence.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. He has been diagnosed with HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), acute renal failure, and is suspected to have acute liver failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and poor oxygenation. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status but continues to have multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's family has agreed to a do not resuscitate (DNR) order.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe pneumonia and sepsis have led to acute respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of developing ARDS due to the inflammatory response in the lungs.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's suspected acute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy could develop, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
3. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, and further deterioration of renal function may occur, leading to an increase in fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Sepsis: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated.  Appears acutely
   worse this AM in regards to his increasing pressor requirement as well
   as his worsening ABG on PS.
   - Given worsening overall hemodynamic status, will turn patient back
   onto rate.  No vent wean for now.
   - f/u cultures, [**2-29**] sputum with yeast
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean sedation today given need for patient to be still
   for CVVH
   - will attempt to slowly diurese with CVVH to remove fluid, however BP
   may not tolerate.
   - will discuss with ID regarding recommendations for possible addition
   of antifungal given previous sputum culture with yeast and development
   of worsening hemodynamics.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with steady
   increase in pressor requirement to attain required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - will add vasopressin at this point for second pressor
   - remains on CVVH
   - cont CVVH today, anticipate net even due to worsening hemodynamics.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with decreased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM, has not stooled in
   days.  Bladder pressure today 40.
   - will contact surgery regarding overall worsening status for
   recommendations regarding possibility of CT abd/pelvis and whether
   findings on CT a/p would change overall surgical plan.
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - will d/c PR vanco
   - F/u Surgery recs
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder pressure increasing
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for continued CVVH today
   - holding on midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay (pending)
   - Heme recs
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue CVVH for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; however, currently on fent/versed
   due to increase in abd tenderness and need for patient to remain still
   for CVVH
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today ([**3-6**]) is day 15 of antibiotics. Still not producing
   BM
s.  Worsening abd exam today.
   - will d/c PR vanco today, cont PO vanco
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   - would consider IVIG for c.diff if next stool sample still c.diff
   positive
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.3, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed. insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now, insulin in TPN
   - Meds via IV
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR, PPI
   .
   # Access: L-CVL placed [**3-4**] (originally R-sided placed on [**2-20**]).  R-HD
   line for CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, Hepatitis B and C, Clostridium difficile colitis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with worsening hemodynamics, increasing pressor requirements, and acute kidney injury. He has a history of ileus versus small bowel obstruction, and abdominal distension. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for various infections, including pneumonia and peritonitis. His platelet count is low, and he has a positive HIT antibody, raising concerns for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's delirium is multifactorial, involving uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and severe infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and the need for additional interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is being used to manage renal failure, but there is a risk of complications related to access and fluid management.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 125 kg male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, hepatitis other, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently receiving CVVH. The patient's family has agreed to do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a poor prognosis for renal recovery, and there is a potential risk of worsening renal failure or the need for renal replacement therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on
   ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated on pressure support
   - f/u cultures
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean sedation today given need for patient to be still
   for CVVH
   - will attempt to slowly diurese with CVVH to remove fluid, however BP
   may not tolerate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal
   decrease in required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses if needed, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - cont CVVH today, will plan for some net removal of fluid.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with increased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options, including initiating feeds today
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan yesterday showed 20, cont to monitor
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for continued CVVH today
   - holding on midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay (pending)
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue CVVH for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; however, currently on fent/versed
   due to increase in abd tenderness and need for patient to remain still
   for CVVH
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today ([**3-5**]) is day 14 of antibiotics. Still not producing
   BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl (now has had a 14 day course)
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   - would consider IVIG for c.diff if next stool sample still c.diff
   positive
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.3, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed. insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now, insulin in TPN
   - Meds via IV
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR, PPI
   .

He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which appears to be a result of aspiration. The patient also has hypotension that has not responded to fluid resuscitation and requires norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure, which is a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal azotemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 yo male with ARF, C diff, alc hep, Hep B and C, now with
   hypoxic respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear what the precipitant was, but
   acute decompensation appears to be a result of aspiration.  Also, in
   the process of intubation, patient had copious emesis and continues to
   have significant OGT output.  Patient has had ileus versus obstruction
   that has been followed during his admission and he likely had
   significant residual gastric contents.  Patient is acutely ill and
   possibly had mini aspirations over the last 10 days prior to ICU
   leading to this rapid decline.  Currently intubated, stable on
   ventilator
   - Continue ventilation, wean as tolerated on pressure support
   - f/u cultures
   - Treat for HAP/aspiration with vanc/cefepime/flagyl as patient had
   been on vanc/ctx prior
   - Continue to follow daily CXR as patient likely experienced aspiration
   event and may develop infiltrate vs pneumonitis
   - Unlikely to wean sedation today given need for patient to be still
   for CVVH
   - will attempt to slowly diurese with CVVH to remove fluid, however BP
   may not tolerate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Became hypotensive in the setting of intubation and in
   spite of fluid boluses, continues to require levophed to maintain MAPs
   >65.  Has had asymptomatic hypotension on the floor multiple times
   responsive to fluid and albumin.  Has been on midodrine at HD for
   hypotension as well.  Currently remains on levophed with minimal
   decrease in required dose for MAP>65
   - Continue levophed to maintain MAP>65
   - Fluid boluses if needed, but would like to avoid given renal failure
   - cont CVVH today, will plan for some net removal of fluid.
   - Treat infection which includes peritonitis, c. diff and possible HAP
   - If continues with hypotension despite adequate treatment, would
   consider echo.
   - Consider vasopressin if needs second pressor.
   .
   # Afferent loop syndrome/ileus vs SBO: Has had questionable diagnosis
   per prior notes, has been followed by GI and surgery and was not felt
   to be a surgical candidate on multiple occasions.  Surgery feels
   percutaneous decompression not a good option.  If patient decompensates
   again, surgery may be considered as patient failing medical management,
   but with high likelihood of death also.  Surgery continues to follow
   and is amenable to surgical consideration if status changes with
   possible surgically correctable condition.  Abdomen with increased
   bowel sounds compared to yesterday. No recent BM.
   - Consider repeat CT abd/pelvis with IV/PO/rectal contrast to assess
   for obstruction/ileus/possible bowel perf.  Will hold off for now
   currently, will plan CT as clinical status changes
   - Continue to hold octreotide which may be worseing ileus
   - Avoid excessive narcotics
   - Continue to follow abdominal exam
   - holding lactulose
   - all IV meds as unclear if GI tract is working.
   - F/u Surgery and GI recs
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] regarding possible options, including initiating feeds today
   - follow lactate, trending downward
   - Bladder scan yesterday showed 20, cont to monitor
   - Continue to readdress prognosis and status with family given option
   for medical management only
   .
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Combination of ATN and prerenal
   azotemia.  Followed by nephrology and recently initiated HD per renal
   recommendations.  Also was treated temporarily for HRS, though given
   that octreotide can worsen SBO, treatment was discontinued.  On
   midodrine prior to HD for hypotension.  No hydro on US.
   - Continue to follow with nephrology and hepatology, appreciate their
   recommendations.
   - Plan for continued CVVH today
   - holding on midodrine
   - follow bladder pressure to rule out compartment syndrome
   - redose meds for CrCl of 20 given CVVH.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: question of patient having HIT given dropping
   platlets and positive HIT antibody. Heme consulted and feel that this
   may be false positive due to HD and we have sent serotonin assay.
   - f/u serotonin assay (pending)
   - Heme recs possible HIV test, consider vanco as additional source of
   [**Month (only) 453**] plts.
   - avoid heparin products for now
   - no need for argatroban
   .
   # Delirium: Unable to currently assess but has been an ongoing problem
   on the floor.  Likely multifactorial including uremia, hepatic
   encephalopathy and severe infection.
   - Continue CVVH for uremia
   - Continue broad spectrum abx which will cover peritonitis and HAP
   - Follow bcx
   - CIS
   - Try to avoid CNS acting medication; however, currently on fent/versed
   due to increase in abd tenderness and need for patient to remain still
   for CVVH
   .
   # Hematochezia: Resolved.  Has received a total of 3 units prbcs, last
   on [**2-20**].
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active T&S
   .
   # C diff. colitis: On PO/PR vanc and IV flagyl given severity of
   colitis. Today ([**3-5**]) is day 14 of antibiotics. Still not producing
   BM
   - Continue PO vanc/flagyl (now has had a 14 day course)
   - cont PR vanco given possibility PO vanco is not getting through
   - Continue to follow stool output, serial abdominal exams
   - would consider IVIG for c.diff if next stool sample still c.diff
   positive
   .
   # Air near tail of pancreas: ? microperf vs pancreatico-colonic
   fistula.  Ascitic fluid amylase of 4.
   - As above, surgery feels patient is poor surgical candidate, will
   readdress based on clinical status
   - Continue to follow exam.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.3, has been elevated throughout admission.
   Likely nutritional and component of liver disease. Patient has received
   multiple doses of vitamin K with little improvement.
   - Continue to follow
   - FFP prior to procedures
   - HCV viral load 509,000 IU/mL
   .
   # DM2: Continue HISS, adjust as needed. insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - Continue TPN for now, insulin in TPN
   - Meds via IV
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots given hematochezia and elevated INR, PPI
   .
   # Access: L-CVL placed [**3-4**] (originally R-sided placed on [**2-20**]).  R-HD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, alcohol hepatitis, and Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration, and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypotension that is poorly responsive to fluids and requires norepinephrine infusion. He has thrombocytopenia, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and requires platelet transfusion. The patient is oliguric with acute renal failure, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), and has a history of hepatorenal syndrome. He has delirium, likely multifactorial in origin, and is at risk for further complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's family has requested no specific information be shared with other family members.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress and could require further interventions such as tracheostomy or prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, and he may require continued support with vasopressors like norepinephrine. There is a risk of developing septic shock or other forms of"
