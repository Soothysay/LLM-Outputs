   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS placement. Source seen on endoscopy
   at OSH was venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then
   opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were
   non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U
   PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with
   activation of massive transfusion protocol; has not had any
   transfusions since.  [**State **] tube removed during the morning.
   - Continue PPI, octreotide gtt
 will touch base with GI regarding
   duration, but likely 48 hr total before transitioning to [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
   discontinuing octreotide
   - Will need repeat US with Doppler to assess TIPS patency
 this should
   be done one week after TIPS (around [**2-16**])
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Respiratory status: Unclear if patient intubated for EtOH withdraw or
   for EGD.  Patient received paralysis for EGD and for med flight.
   Currently intubated.  Patient has had no problems with oxygenation.
   RSBI [**8-5**] this am.
   - Continue to wean off sedation
   - Continue PSV and attempt to wean off ventilation later today
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Appears to be net volume up on exam and CXR. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload with Cr unlikely where
   he chronically lives. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Trial IV lasix 10mg
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Positive blood cultures. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures. Patient
   does not look septic, other cultures negative. Given medical
   comorbidities, lines and recent hospitalization, will start treatment
   and continue to check cultures.
   - Start vancomycin
   - Check blood cultures both today and tomorrow
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue to use propofol for sedation; wean as tolerated
   - Needs valium prn CIWA once not sedated
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Monitor for signs of encephalopathy s/p weaning off sedation
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and end-stage liver disease (ELSD) secondary to alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital for variceal bleeding and underwent endoscopic banding twice. Due to recurrent and refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient was transferred to another hospital for further management.

At the receiving hospital, the patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. He received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 4 fresh frozen plasma (FPP) transfusions at the previous hospital, but has not required any transfusions since admission. The patient's gastric tube was removed during the morning rounds.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute Refractory UGIB: The source of bleeding was identified as venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up. Gastric ulcers were also seen on previous banding sites that were non-bleeding. The patient has already undergone banding twice. TIPS placement was performed, and the patient is currently on continuous pantoprazole and octreotide infusions. Repeat ultrasound with Doppler will be done one week after TIPS to assess its patency.

2. Respiratory Status: The patient received paralysis for endoscopy and medical flight. Currently intubated, the patient has had no problems with oxygenation. The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver disease (ELSD) secondary to ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital with variceal bleeding and underwent endoscopic banding twice. Subsequently, he was transferred to another hospital for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement.

The patient presented with acute refractory UGIB, and a source was identified as venous blood that opened up during attempted sclerosing. Gastric ulcers were also seen on previous banding sites. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 4 fresh frozen plasma (FPP) at the previous hospital, with additional 2 units of PRBC on arrival at the current hospital. He activated the massive transfusion protocol but did not receive any transfusions since then.

The patient is currently being treated with continuous [State] tube, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), octreotide gtt, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone) for gastrointestinal bleed prophylaxis. He is also on active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units.

The patient's respiratory status is unclear whether he was intubated for ethanol withdrawal or for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He received paralysis for EGD and for medical flight."

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for esophageal laceration secondary to ethanol abuse. He has undergone endoscopic banding twice and has had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient has also been diagnosed with acute refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition includes being on invasive ventilation, arterial line, central venous catheter, and peripheral intravenous lines. He is also on multiple medications including proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, lactulose, rifaximin, and lasix. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time with a slightly low international normalized ratio.

The patient's imaging studies reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette and vascular engorgement consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, suggesting the possibility of heart failure or fluid overload. Other imaging"

   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS. Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was
   venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE
   ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.
   Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP
   at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive
   transfusion protocol; has not had any transfusions since.  [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].
   - Change PPI to PO bid
   - Discontinue octreotide gtt
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100

   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Continue to check blood cultures qd [**Date range (1) 12635**]

   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix. Still appears to be net
   volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Repeat lasix IV 20mg with repeat during pm prn
   - Continue to monitor UOP

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and chronic liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and underwent endoscopic banding at the outside hospital (OSH). The patient then developed acute refractory UGIB and required placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). He was transferred to this hospital for management of recurrent refractory UGIB. The patient had a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 4 fresh frozen plasma (FPP) transfusions at OSH, with an additional 2 units of PRBCs on arrival. The patient's massive transfusion protocol was activated, but he did not require any further transfusions. The patient's [**State **] tube was removed on [**2-10**].

The patient has several medical complications and comorbidities, including alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, hepatic cirrhosis (likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C), diabetes mellitus (DM), and feeding tube (FEN) management. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but preliminary results show gram-positive cocci. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and preliminary results indicate a possible infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital for variceal bleeding and underwent endoscopy with banding. The patient then developed alcohol withdrawal symptoms and was transferred to another hospital for management of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, which has stabilized his hemodynamic status.

The patient's current condition is complicated by acute mental status changes (AMS) with concerns for benzodiazepine withdrawal and hepatic encephalopathy. There is also a possibility of benzodiazepine overdose. The patient has a positive blood culture showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, possible Enterococcus species, from a line-related source. Other cultures are negative.

The patient's medical history includes esophageal varices, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, TIPS procedure, alcohol withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, possible benzodiazepine overdose, and unknown history of diabetes mellitus. The patient's liver disease is likely secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C infection.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continued use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, monitoring of blood cultures, repeat ultrasound with doppler to assess TIPS patency, advancement of nutrition, and monitoring for signs of encephalopathy. The patient's disposition will"

   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of events:
    (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was attempted
   to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous
   banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding
   x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol; has
   not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **] tube
   removed [**2-10**].)

   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100

   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Continue to check blood cultures qd [**Date range (1) 12635**]

   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy. [**Month (only) 51**] also have
   component secondary to post-sedation.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - Continue to monitor

   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix. Still appears to be net
   volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes

   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate

   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart vancomycin (was discontinued yesterday, first started on [**2-10**]
   and restarted today)
   - Repeat BC today.
   # AMS
   Patient is stuporous today, without focality. Classic for delirium, has
   been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed fluctuating mental
   status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without asterixis and less likely
   due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory status and renal function are
   also good. Given alcohol history, need to check B12. Also initiate
   reversible causes of dementia workup.
   - B12, TSH and consider HIV testing
   - Continue lactulose, rifixamin

   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to monitor
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix last night. Cr downtrending s/p
   lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely
   AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today.
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent endoscopic banding twice. The patient then transferred to another hospital for management of refractory UGIB and received a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Upon admission, the patient had altered mental status (AMS) with suspected benzodiazepine withdrawal and hepatic encephalopathy. He also had a positive blood culture indicating a possible hospital-acquired infection. The patient's condition has been stabilized, and he is currently being treated for AMS, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and potential volume overload. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there is concern for a partial biliary obstruction. The patient's medical history includes alcohol withdrawal, hepatitis C, and possible diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream that the liver cannot filter out.
2. Infection: The positive blood culture suggests a possible hospital-acquired infection. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent sepsis.
3. Bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized, there is still a risk of re-bleeding from the"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has a history of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. On admission, he presented with altered mental status and high endotoxin levels.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient tolerated oral lactulose without regurgitation, so a nasogastric (NG) tube was not placed. A bedside ultrasound did not reveal any ascites for diagnostic paracentesis.

The patient had a bowel movement that appeared dark, raising concerns of new bleeding. Hematocrit (Hct) levels were stable throughout the day. The patient responded well to morning furosemide with a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters at 1530 and 1600. Electrolytes were repleted.

In the afternoon, the patient's mental status remained altered, and he was started on Ativan CIWA, with a low likelihood of withdrawal being the cause. He received 1 mg of Ativan in the late evening, which seemed to calm him down.

The patient also developed some erythema on his red toe, which needs to be assessed further.

On the next day, the patient's I/O showed a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters at 2200 after receiving 40 mg IV lasix. Hepatology recommended continuing ceftriaxone and the current treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Obtain B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for esophageal variceal bleeding. He underwent endoscopic banding twice and was transferred to another hospital for management of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient then underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. He is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient also has a positive blood culture and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status and may develop further cognitive impairment or coma if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The positive blood culture indicates a possible bloodstream infection. The patient is already on vancomycin, but close monitoring and repeat cultures are necessary to ensure appropriate treatment.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's urine output is decreased, and there is a concern for acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has undergone TIPS, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding. Continuous monitoring and assessment of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and laboratory values are essential.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and assessment of coagulation parameters"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Consider B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   - Obtain ultrasound as per above
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   - Send A1c
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn; low
   sodium regular diet, soft dysphagia

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who has been admitted to the ICU for several reasons. The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) secondary to esophageal varices and underwent endoscopic banding. He also required blood transfusions during his stay at another hospital. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was performed due to recurrent bleeding despite banding.

The patient's current condition includes delirium, which is consistent with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. His mental status remains stuporous with dense delirium, and he is oriented only to himself. He continues to require restraints and has not required extra sedation.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure ranging from 154/91 to 168/116 mmHg, heart rate between 100 and 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on room air.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total fluid balance of 556 mL since 02:23 AM. His respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula, with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of pH 7.25.

Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and liver disease admitted to the ICU for variceal bleeding. He underwent endoscopic banding, transcatheter intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and tube placement. The patient's current condition includes stupor, mild jaundice, peripheral edema, and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. He has elevated liver enzymes and is positive for hepatitis C. The patient's medical history includes alcoholism, cirrhosis, and possible Korsakoff syndrome. The patient's current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, ativan, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's symptoms of stupor, fluctuating mental status, and picking at sheets suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is a result of liver dysfunction and can be exacerbated by factors such as alcohol withdrawal.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with variceal bleeding, which is a significant risk for patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. There is a possibility of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for Enterococcus species, which is sensitive to vancomycin. This indicates a potential bacterial infection that requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.
4. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and cholestatic pattern suggest ongoing"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the hospital for variceal bleeding. He underwent endoscopic banding twice and subsequently developed alcohol withdrawal symptoms, leading to transfer to another hospital. At this hospital, he underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, although with a modest drop in gradient post-procedure.

The patient's current concerns include delirium (alcohol withdrawal syndrome), hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential complications related to TIPS. 

Delirium is characterized by an altered mental status, fluctuating attention, disorganized thinking, and sometimes hallucinations. The patient is stuporous, inattentive, and shows classic signs of delirium without focal neurologic deficits. Hepatic encephalopathy is suspected due to the patient's history of alcohol abuse and liver dysfunction. Respiratory and renal functions are within normal limits.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding was managed with banding, transfusions, and placement of a [State] tube. His hemoglobin concentration is stable, and he has not required further transfusions since admission.

Blood cultures revealed the presence of Enterococcus species, which are sensitive to Vancomycin. However, the patient does not appear septic, and other cultures are negative. Treatment with Vancomycin has been initiated, and blood cultures will be repeated daily for three days.

Liver enzymes are elevated, as expected following"
