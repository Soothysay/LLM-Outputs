","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She underwent elective intubation for airway protection and monitoring due to a dental abscess that was surgically drained. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and is expected to have her airway evaluated by ENT to check for cuff leak. The plan is to wean ventilator settings, reduce sedation, and consider extubation if possible. The patient has drains in place for the dental abscess, which will be monitored and changed only if there is pus drainage. She is also being treated with antibiotics (clindamycin and levofloxacin) until cultures from the surgery return. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented.
2. Dental abscess complications: Although the abscess has been surgically drained, there is still a risk of infection spreading or recurrent infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as increasing pain, swelling, or fever, is important.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a possibility of hypotension due to sepsis or other factors. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate fluid management should be considered.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a recent dental abscess that required incision and drainage. She was admitted for elective intubation due to an airway obstruction and is currently in the ICU. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and her vital signs are stable. Her white blood cell count is decreasing, indicating improvement. Cultures from the dental abscess are pending. She is receiving antibiotics (clindamycin and levofloxacin) for the dental abscess, as well as medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism. The plan is to wean off sedation, assess for extubation, and monitor for any complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She presented to the ICU for airway protection and monitoring due to a dental abscess. The patient underwent elective intubation and is currently on invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's labs show a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL, Hct of 35.3%, Plt of 333 K/uL, Cr of 0.7 mg/dL, and Glucose of 113 mg/dL. Her blood culture from the abscess is negative, but cultures are pending. 

Plan:
The plan includes weaning off sedation and extubation if possible, checking for a cuff leak, and monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress. The drains in the dental area will be left in place. Antibiotics will be continued until the culture results return. The patient's other conditions, such as hypertension and hypothyroidism, will be managed accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a recent dental abscess who was admitted for elective intubation due to airway protection and monitoring. She underwent oral surgery with pus drainage from a dental abscess and has drains in place. The patient was extubated without difficulty and maintained stable oxygen saturation overnight. She is currently on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the recent intubation and extubation, the patient may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any signs of infection or deterioration is crucial.

2. Dental Abscess: Although the patient underwent oral surgery and pus drainage, there is a possibility of residual infection or recurrence of the abscess. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or drainage from the surgical site is important.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which appears to be better controlled with enalapril. It is essential to continue monitoring blood pressure and adjust medication as needed to maintain optimal control.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, for which she is currently taking levothyroxine. Once the patient starts taking oral medications again, it will be necessary to restart this medication.

5. Breast Cancer History: Although there are no active issues related to her breast"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a recent dental abscess who was intubated for airway protection. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a face tent. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive mental status. The patient has absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedis arteries. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's WBC count has decreased over time.

The assessment and plan include respiratory stability with the goal of weaning ventilator settings, obtaining respiratory system resistance index (RSBI), checking for cuff leak, weaning sedation, and extubation if able. The patient is also being monitored for a dental abscess with drains in place, as well as ongoing management of hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient's code status is full code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a dental abscess who presented for elective intubation due to airway protection and monitoring. The patient was extubated without difficulty and maintained stable oxygen saturation overnight. She is currently on room air and has no respiratory events.

The patient has a dental abscess that was surgically treated with pus drainage of 5 cc, with drains in place. It is expected that the ENT will remove the drains today. Cultures from the surgery are pending, and the patient will continue on clindamycin and levofloxacin until the results are available.

The patient's hypertension is currently better controlled, and she will restart PO medications once she is taking oral intake. Her hypothyroidism will be continued with Levothyroxine once she is taking PO.

The patient has a history of breast cancer with no active issues. She is currently NPO and will advance her diet according to ENT recommendations. She will receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and a bowel regimen. She has two PIV lines and is coded as full code. 

The patient is expected to be safe for transfer to the floor."
