   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9586**] is a 87 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for afib
   with RVR, HTN, GERD, DM 2, CVA admitted on [**2160-9-11**] from [**Hospital1 747**] for
   orthostatic hypotension, dizziness and emesis, likely source is GIB
   subsequently developed afib with rvr, dyspnea and relative hypotension
   and was transferred to the MICU.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with new O2 requirement with ABG 7.42/47/75 on 6L nc
   and 40% shovel mask.  Differential for hypoxia with A-A gradient
   includes volume overload/pulmonary edema in setting of afib with RVR,
   dCHF, ACS, or aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia (diffusion), V/Q
   mismatch in setting of increased abdominal distention, and shunt from
   PE.  CXR with some cephalization although without excessive pulmonary
   edema. Patient was diuresed with improvement of oxygen status. He was
   also rate contolled. Pro-BNP was acutely elevated suggesting stretch
   and fluid overload.
   -Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG - thus far
   negative
   -Repeat TTE
   -Diurese as tolerated
   -Repeat CXR
   -HR control with diltiazem PO and IV prn, goal HR 80-100
   -Continue cefepime, vanco, flagyl for health-care associated/aspiration
   pneumonia.  Will also check a sputum culture and plan to discontinue
   antimicrobial therapy in culture NGTD at 48 hours.
   -Can consider NPPV if necessary. Patient is DNR/DNI.
   -Defer CTA to rule out PE for now given contrast load yesterday for
   CTAP, although PE is a possibility with new O2 requirement and afib
   with RVR. However, unlikely to anticoagulate even if PE due to GIB.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Likely secondary to erosive esophagitis. Hct currently
   stable, although stools have been OB brown positive.
   - Hct Q12H, transfuse for hct <21, active hemorrhage, or end organ
   damage.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Follow-up GI recs if any.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient with history of AF that converted to
   sinus sponatenously in [**9-30**].  Currently with new afib with RVR
   -Rate control with diltiazem
   .
   # CV: TTE in [**7-1**] with LVEF<55% with LVH and dCHF.  Patient currently
   without chest pain.
   - Rule out ACS as above
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Hold aggrenox given GIB
   - Check BNP
   .
   # CVA: Hold aggrenox given GIB.
   .
   # Abdominal Distention: Initially concerning for SBO, although CTAP
   negative. Patient was also evaluated by surgery in the ED with low
   suspicion for SBO.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBCs 16.7 with left shift. Differential includes
   reactive leukocytosis in setting of GIB versus or aspiration event.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS, hold metformin while inpatient.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9586**] is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital from [**Hospital1 747**] for orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and emesis, and was found to have upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient developed afib with RVR on flood with worsening dyspnea and was transferred to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen, indicating respiratory distress. The ABG results show a slight deviation from normal values. Possible causes include volume overload/pulmonary edema due to atrial fibrillation with RVR, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia (diffusion), ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to increased abdominal distention, or shunt from pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage (GIB): The patient has a history of erosive esophagitis and is experiencing melena, indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This could be due to erosive esophagitis or another source of bleeding within the GI tract."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's respiratory distress has multiple potential explanations and concerns, including congestive heart failure (CHF) due to ischemia, diastolic dysfunction, or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute coronary syndrome, aspiration pneumonitis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently receiving net diuretics, empirical antimicrobials, and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation. 

The patient also has a gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to esophagitis as confirmed by EGD. This is being managed with proton pump inhibitors and holding aspirin and Aggrenox. Anemia is present, likely secondary to the GI bleed and IV repletion. Serial Hct monitoring is recommended. The patient has abdominal distention, which is attributed to constipation. An abdominal CT was unremarkable. It would be prudent to check liver function tests, amylase, and lipase.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support. Glycemic control is being monitored, and the patient has multiple IV lines. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and systemic antico"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response following an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient has multiple potential explanations for his respiratory distress, including congestive heart failure (CHF), acute coronary syndrome, aspiration pneumonitis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently receiving net diuretics and empirical antibiotics.

The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has responded to diltiazem. The plan is to continue diltiazem and hold acute anticoagulation due to a gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient also has evidence of GI bleed, likely secondary to esophagitis seen on EGD. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will be continued, and aspirin and Aggrenox will be held.

There has been a decline in the patient's hemoglobin concentration, which may be attributed to the GI bleed and intravenous repletion. Serial hemoglobin checks will be performed.

Abdominal distention is noted, but an abdominal CT scan is unremarkable, suggesting that it may be attributed to constipation. Liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase should be monitored.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support. The patient's glycemic control will be monitored.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the ICU from another hospital for orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and emesis, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). During his stay in the ICU, he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, dyspnea, and relative hypotension, which led to his transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has an A-a gradient indicating a possible diffusion defect or V/Q mismatch.
2. Hematemesis: The patient has experienced vomiting of blood, likely secondary to erosive esophagitis. His hemoglobin concentration is stable, but his stools have been observed to be obstipation (constipation) positive.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has required increased oxygen support. His chest X-ray shows mild centrilobular emphysema but no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
4. Constipation (obstipation, FOS): The patient's bowel movements have been infrequent and difficult to pass.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type 1: Although the patient has a history of DM2, there is no mention of type 1 diabetes in the progress note.
6. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF that converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously in the past. However, he is currently experiencing new-onset AF with rapid ventricular response.
7. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which has been managed with diuretics and rate control medications.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has a history of GERD, which may be contributing to his gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB): The patient has experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to erosive esophagitis.
10. Cardiac conditions: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), as indicated by his echocardiogram showing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and reduced ejection fraction (<55%).
11. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient has a history of CVA, which may be related to his current medications and comorbidities.
12. Abdominal distention: The patient initially presented with abdominal dist"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was admitted to the ICU for orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and emesis, likely originating from gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Subsequently, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, dyspnea, and relative hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has new O2 requirements with an ABG showing a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 47 mmHg and an oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 75% on 6 liters of nasal cannula and 40% shovel mask. Differential for hypoxia includes volume overload/pulmonary edema in the setting of afib with RVR, decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia (diffusion), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch in the setting of increased abdominal distention, and shunt from pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was diuresed with improvement of oxygen status. Further evaluation is needed to rule out"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU for orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and emesis, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, dyspnea, and relative hypotension. He has also experienced acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, aspiration pneumonitis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including volume overload, pulmonary edema, increased abdominal distention, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are low, indicating potential hypoxia. This could be due to various reasons such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB, which may have contributed to his current condition. The bleeding could be from erosive esophagitis or another source. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion may be necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control is essential to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9586**] is a 87 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for afib
   with RVR, HTN, GERD, DM 2, CVA admitted on [**2160-9-11**] from [**Hospital1 747**] for
   orthostatic hypotension, dizziness and emesis, likely source is GIB
   subsequently developed afib with rvr, dyspnea and relative hypotension
   and was transferred to the MICU.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Respiratory status improving.  Differential for hypoxia with
   A-A gradient includes volume overload/pulmonary edema in setting of
   afib with RVR, dCHF, ACS, or aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia
   (diffusion), V/Q mismatch in setting of increased abdominal distention,
   and shunt from PE.  CXR with some cephalization although without
   excessive pulmonary edema. Patient was diuresed with improvement of
   oxygen status. He was also rate contolled. Pro-BNP was acutely elevated
   suggesting stretch and fluid overload.
   -Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG - thus far
   negative
   -echo read pending - will follow up
   -chest X-ray shows no significant change, possibly slightly improved
   overall congestion.
   -HR control with diltiazem PO and IV prn, goal HR 80-100
   -d/c antibiotics, CXR not impressive for pna
   -Can consider NPPV if necessary. Patient is DNR/DNI.
   - LENI - negative.
   - CTA performed, negative.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Likely secondary to erosive esophagitis. Hct currently
   stable, although stools have been OB brown positive.
   - Hct Q12H, transfuse for hct <21, active hemorrhage, or end organ
   damage.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Follow-up GI recs if any.
   - nausea treatment
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient with history of AF that converted to
   sinus sponatenously in [**9-30**].  Currently with new afib with RVR, HR has
   been well-controlled over past 24 hours.
   -Rate control with diltiazem
   .
   # CV: TTE in [**7-1**] with LVEF<55% with LVH and dCHF.  Patient currently
   without chest pain.
   -Echo yesterday ([**9-13**]) read still pending - will follow up.
   - Rule out ACS as above
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Hold aggrenox given GIB
   - Check BNP
   .
   # Abdominal Distention: Initially concerning for SBO, CTAP negative.
   Patient was also evaluated by surgery in the ED with low suspicion for
   SBO.
   - Continue bowel regimen, advance diet slowly
   .
    # Question of infection - leukocytosis resolved, afebrile.  Low
   likelihood of current infection.
   -following cultures - sputum culture contaminated, urine cx negative.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS, hold metformin while inpatient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with acute hypoxemic respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The respiratory distress has multiple potential explanations, including congestive heart failure (CHF), acute coronary syndrome, and aspiration pneumonitis. However, there is no evidence for pulmonary embolism, and the cause is attributed to pulmonary edema/CHF. Net diuresis should be continued.

The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to diltiazem. Diltiazem should be continued, and acute anticoagulation should be held due to a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has anemia, likely due to the GI bleed and IV repletion.
