   # Hypotension: Resolved. Likely from acute blood loss in or around her
   gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No evidence of more distal
   GI bleeding.  Afebrile with negative micro to date make sepsis
   relatively unlikely. Also in absence of respiratory compromise unlikely
   PE.
   - Hct improved wtih 3 units of pRBCs (has been stable around 33)
   - If Hct falls again with no response to pRBC may benefit from

   - CVP monitoring (range of [**9-30**])
   - Vanc/zosyn for now until negative cultures (continue for 24hours
   empiric therapy)
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site. With such robust response to 3 units of pRBCs the
   nadir of ~19 could have been falsely low.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Cycle Hcts [**Hospital1 **] for today, transfuse to 30
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: hold G-tube feeds for now.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn morphine
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin until able to use G-tube again at which time will
   return to prior regimen of lamictal
   - Will check phenytoin level

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old woman with mental retardation due to Rett syndrome, a gastrocutaneous fistula following previous laparotomy, and hypotension with acute hematocrit drop. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/78 mmHg to 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which have stabilized her hematocrit level around 33%. Blood cultures have been taken, showing no growth so far. Urine culture indicates yeast infection with 100,000 organisms. The patient's CVP monitoring shows a range of 10-25 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an input of 3,045 mL and output of 1,149 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given Vanc/Zosyn antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: Resolved due to acute blood loss in or around the gastrostomy site, complicated by oversedation. No evidence of more distal GI bleeding. Sepsis is relatively unlikely due to the absence of fever and negative microbiology results. A possible"

   32 year old woman with hx of mental retardation secondary to Retts
   syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula s/p ex-lap and takedown now with
   hypotension and acute Hct drop.
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Likely from acute blood loss in or around her
   gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No evidence of more distal
   GI bleeding.  Afebrile with negative micro to date make sepsis
   relatively unlikely. Also in absence of respiratory compromise unlikely
   PE.
   - Hct improved wtih 3 units of pRBCs (has been stable around 33)
   - If Hct falls again with no response to pRBC may benefit from
   take-back to OR, will discuss with [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   - CVP monitoring (range of [**9-30**])
   - Vanc/zosyn for now until negative cultures for empiric tx of GI
   pathogen -> Vanc level 39 so discontinued for now, will restart when
   less than 20 if needed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Cycle Hcts [**Hospital1 **] for today, transfuse to 30
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: hold G-tube feeds for now.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn morphine, can consider changing to dilaudid if
   inadequat control being careful not to oversedate.
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin until able to use G-tube again at which time will
   return to prior regimen of lamictal
   - Will check phenytoin level

","The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation secondary to Rett syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula following an exploratory laparotomy and takedown procedure, who is now presenting with hypotension and acute hematocrit drop. She has a multi-lumen central venous catheter in place, and her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/78 to 194/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is receiving morphine sulfate for pain management and has received units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address the acute blood loss and subsequent drop in hematocrit.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and red skin surrounding the surgical site. She has trace edema in both lower extremities and contracted feet. Neurologically, she responds to verbal stimuli and exhibits non-purposeful movement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old female with Rett's syndrome who underwent gastrocutaneous fistula repair. She presented with hypotension and acute blood loss anemia, and her vital signs have been unstable since admission. The patient's blood pressure has been in the range of 80's systolic and tachycardia in the range of 150's. She received a blood transfusion, which temporarily improved her condition. An intra-jugular (IJ) line was placed overnight.

The patient's allergy history is negative for drug allergies. She was previously on piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, but these medications were discontinued on 03/30/2137 at 02:17 AM and 08:00 AM, respectively. She is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the noted complications related to her surgery. Her flow sheet data indicates ongoing hypotension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 92 to 139 mmHg over the past 24 hours. Her heart rate has been consistently elevated, between 115 and 138 beats per minute. Respiratory rate has been stable at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation has been maintained above 98%.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,045 mL and output of 1,149 mL since midnight, resulting in a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old female with Rett's syndrome who underwent a gastrocutaneous fistula repair. She presented with hypotension and acute blood loss anemia postoperatively. The patient's tachycardia has worsened to a pulse rate of 150 beats per minute, and her blood pressure remains in the 80s. She received a blood transfusion, which improved her hemoglobin levels. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Despite improvement in the patient's condition, there is still a possibility of infection due to the presence of an indwelling catheter and surgical site.
2. Bleeding: Although the bleeding seems to have stopped, there is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing occult bleeding.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which can be attributed to a combination of factors such as sedative medications, hypovolemia from acute blood loss, or sepsis.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration, especially given the presence of a nasogastric tube and potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Neurological complications: As the patient has Rett's syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder, she may be at risk for seizures or other neurological events.
6. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation secondary to Rett syndrome, who presented with hypotension and an acute drop in hematocrit (Hct). She has a gastrocutaneous fistula post-ex lap and takedown. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and her Hct has been stable around 33. Blood cultures, urine culture, and stool guaiac tests have been ordered. The patient is currently on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric treatment of GI pathogens. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 155/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed contracted feet, red skin surrounding the surgical site, and poor dentition. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with ongoing assessments and plans in place for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient may develop further blood loss due to the gastrocutaneous fistula, leading to a decrease in Hct and potential symptoms of anemia.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and"

   Micro: [**3-26**] and [**3-12**] urine cultures growing yeast.  With positive UA,
   negative blood cultures.
   Assessment and Plan
   32 year old woman with hx of mental retardation secondary to Retts
   syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula s/p ex-lap and takedown now with
   hypotension and acute Hct drop.
   #Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, infection, PE.  Difficult to
   assess pain control as pt is non-verbal but in setting of  new
   hypertension and apparent agitation, seems reasonable to assume pain is
   not well controlled.  B/L LENIs negative for DVT, PE less likely, would
   not be candidate for anticoagulation at this point given recent bleed.
   Pt is hypoxic with RA sats in 90s.  CXR no evidence for PNA.  Possible
   pt is splinting due to abd pain, or has atelectasis.
   -Have increased dilaudid to increased pain control
   -BB TID per surgical recs.
   -supplemental 02 PRN
   -continue pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Likely from acute blood loss in or around her
   gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No evidence of more distal
   GI bleeding.  Also on ddx for hypotension include sepsis, sources
   include surgical, urine, lungs.  CXR/CT without evidence for PNA, PE.
   - Hct improved wtih 3 units of pRBCs (has been stable around 33),
   however down to 30.9 this am, ~1point drop from yesterday.
   - Will continue to trend HCT
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms on
   two samples with a positive UA.
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   - CVP monitoring (range of [**9-30**])
   - Got vanc and zosyn initially for empiric coverage, continued on zosyn
   since [**3-29**] for empiric coverage of GI pathogen.  No growth on blood
   cultures.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Cycle Hcts [**Hospital1 **] for today, transfuse to 30
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: Restart TF today, hold for residuals
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn dilaudid.
   #UTI.  Pt had positive UA, cultures grew yeast while on vanc/zosyn.
   -continue to cover broadly for infection with zosyn for urine and
   possible abdominal pathogen in post-operative setting
   -consider narrowing to CTX pending blood culture data to cover for 7
   day course UTI
   -Foley changed.
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin until able to use G-tube again at which time will
   return to prior regimen of lamictal
   - Will check phenytoin level, was subtherapeutic on [**3-29**], recheck
   tomorrow.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to increase dose, or if G-tube functioning can
   restart lamictal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with mental retardation secondary to Rett syndrome, who has a gastrocutaneous fistula post-ex lap and takedown. She presents with hypotension and acute Hct drop. She has tachycardia, but no evidence of PE on CT scan. Her blood cultures are negative, while urine cultures grow yeast. She is hypoxic with RA sats in the 90s. She has abdominal pain, possibly due to her surgical site, and there is no evidence of pneumonia. Her Hct has been stable around 33 but dropped to 30.9 this morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to acute blood loss in or around her gastrostomy site, complicated by oversedation. Other possible causes include sepsis, with sources such as surgical, urine, or lung infections. There is no evidence of distal GI bleeding, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.

2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient likely has acute blood loss anemia from blood loss in or around her gastrostomy site. This has resulted in a drop in her Hct levels. Continuous monitoring of Hct is recommended, and she should be transfused to maintain a Hct of 30.

3. Gastrocutaneous Fistula: The patient has a gastrocutaneous fistula, which needs to be addressed by surgery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension, currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with persistent tachycardia and hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. Initial workup revealed an elevated white blood cell count and elevated inflammatory markers, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there has been no improvement in symptoms. Imaging studies have ruled out pulmonary embolism, but deep vein thrombosis (DVT) cannot be completely excluded without further testing. The patient's vital signs have fluctuated throughout the day, with persistent tachycardia, low-grade fever, and variable blood pressure readings. Fluid balance has been closely monitored, with a significant amount of fluid administration and output. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, analgesics, and vasopressors. Laboratory results show signs of renal impairment, with elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures have been obtained to evaluate for potential infection sources. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite ruling out pulmonary embolism, the patient's risk factors and clinical presentation may still suggest the presence of DVT. Further evaluation, such as Doppler ultrasound, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate anticoagulant therapy if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female admitted to the ICU for an acute respiratory distress/asthma exacerbation. She is currently on CPAP and requires frequent nebulizers. Although there has been some improvement over the past day, aeration is still limited. The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing nebulizer treatments and to change steroids to a q12h dosing.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and being on CPAP, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated infections.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is noted as negative, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management to prevent complications such as electrolyte imbalances or organ dysfunction.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 is at 95%, indicating that she may still be experiencing some degree of hypoxemia despite being on CPAP. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate"

Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), current temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate 109 bpm (normal range 105-140 bpm), blood pressure 151/93 mmHg (previously 106/53 mmHg), respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute (normal range 17-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 21 mmHg (normal range 17-32 mmHg). The patient has received a total of 1,400 mL of fluids and has had a blood product transfusion of 810 mL. Her urine output is 1,240 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, white blood cell count of 249 K/uL, sodium level of 80 mg/dL, potassium level of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose level of 121 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count, creatinine, and calcium levels are within normal range. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, and her magnesium and phosphate levels are low. The patient's urine culture is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and Hct drop: The patient's hypotension and Hct drop could indicate ongoing bleeding or fluid shifts. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, CVP, and urine output will help assess fluid status and guide further management.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be due to hypoxia or an underlying condition such as a PE. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the tachycardia and whether additional interventions are required.
3. Gastrocutaneous fistula: The patient's recent surgery for the gastrocutaneous fistula requires close monitoring for any complications related to the surgical site or ongoing fistula formation.
4. Seizure: The patient is on Diltiazem for seizure prophylaxis. Monitoring for any signs of seizure activity and ensuring appropriate antiepileptic drug levels are maintained is important.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is on Zosyn for suspected UTI. It is crucial to wait for the urine culture results to guide antibiotic therapy appropriately.
6. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale should be used to maintain tight glycemic control and prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's LENI is negative for DVT, there is still a risk of developing a DVT due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures such as leg exercises and compression stockings should be continued."

   is fluid overload, pain and anxiety are also on differential but less
   likely as pt is sleeping apparently comfortably. PE and sepsis unlikely
   given pt is hypertensive, not hypotensive, elevated CVPs.
   - CVP monitoring (range of 16-25)
   - CXR this am poor qualitiy given rotation and presence of hardware,
   however there is suggestion of pulmonary edema.
   - Will diurese with lasix goal negative >1L, if pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation due to Rett syndrome, who has undergone an exploratory laparotomy and takedown of a gastrocutaneous fistula. She is currently experiencing hypotension, acute Hct drop, tachycardia, and relative hypoxia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, with a complicated course including pain, anxiety, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), infection, and dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension post-op has resolved but there is a concern for ongoing fluid loss or sepsis as potential causes. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis with sources such as surgical, urine, and lungs. The patient is now hypertensive and tachycardic, suggesting fluid overload.

2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient likely experienced acute blood loss in or around the gastrostomy site, leading to anemia. The hematocrit (Hct) levels have improved with the transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

3. Gastrocutaneous Fistula: The patient has a gastrocutaneous fistula that needs to be managed. The goal is to restart tube feeding (TF) at a low rate of 20/hour, with monitoring for residuals. TPN will continue for now, and the patient will be followed up with"

   #Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, infection, PE.  Difficult to
   assess pain control as pt is non-verbal but in setting of  new

   not well controlled.  B/L LENIs negative for DVT, PE less likely, would
   not be candidate for anticoagulation at this point given recent bleed.
   Pt is hypoxic with RA sats in 90s.  CXR no evidence for PNA.  Possible

","The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation secondary to Rett syndrome, who also has a gastrocutaneous fistula following previous exploratory laparotomy and takedown procedure. She presents with hypotension and acute hematocrit (Hct) drop. 

She is persistently tachycardic and has been given dilaudid for pain control. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn) are being continued for urinary tract infection/intraabdominal infection, as urine cultures have grown yeast. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 106 bpm with a range of 104-126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/61 mmHg to 177/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 15-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg with a range of 16-27 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   32 year old woman with hx of mental retardation secondary to Retts
   syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula s/p ex-lap and takedown now with
   hypotension and acute Hct drop.
   #Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, infection, PE.  Difficult to
   assess pain control as pt is non-verbal but in setting of  new
   hypertension and apparent agitation, seems reasonable to assume pain is
   not well controlled.  B/L LENIs negative for DVT, PE less likely, would
   not be candidate for anticoagulation at this point given recent bleed.
   Pt is hypoxic with RA sats in 90s.  CXR no evidence for PNA.  Possible
   pt is splinting due to abd pain, or has atelectasis.
   -Have increased dilaudid to increased pain control
   -BB TID per surgical recs.
   -supplemental 02 PRN
   -continue pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Likely from acute blood loss in or around her
   gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No evidence of more distal
   GI bleeding.  Also on ddx for hypotension include sepsis, sources
   include surgical, urine, lungs.  CXR/CT without evidence for PNA, PE.
   - Hct improved wtih 3 units of pRBCs (has been stable around 33),
   however down to 30.9 this am, ~1point drop from yesterday.
   - Will continue to trend HCT
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms on
   two samples with a positive UA.
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   - CVP monitoring (range of [**9-30**])
   - Got vanc and zosyn initially for empiric coverage, continued on zosyn
   since [**3-29**] for empiric coverage of GI pathogen.  No growth on blood
   cultures.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Cycle Hcts [**Hospital1 **] for today, transfuse to 30
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: Restart TF today, hold for residuals
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn dilaudid.
   #UTI.  Pt had positive UA, cultures grew yeast while on vanc/zosyn.
   -continue to cover broadly for infection with zosyn for urine and
   possible abdominal pathogen in post-operative setting
   -consider narrowing to CTX pending blood culture data to cover for 7
   day course UTI
   -Foley changed.
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin until able to use G-tube again at which time will
   return to prior regimen of lamictal
   - Will check phenytoin level, was subtherapeutic on [**3-29**], recheck

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation due to Rett syndrome, who is currently in the ICU. She has undergone an exploratory laparotomy and takedown of her gastrocutaneous fistula. The patient is experiencing hypotension, acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), tachycardia, and difficulty in pain assessment. There is suspicion of infection, possibly urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by positive urine cultures showing yeast growth. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). She has a gastrocutaneous fistula, for which she is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition. Her seizures have been controlled with phenytoin, and she is also being treated for hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to acute blood loss from the gastrostomy site or other causes such as sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Acute Anemia: The drop in Hct suggests acute blood loss, which could be from the gastrostomy site or other sources.
3. Infection: The positive urine cultures indicate a possible UTI, and there is concern for other sources of infection, such as surgical site infection or pneumonia.
4. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for developing D"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 32-year-old female with Rett's syndrome who underwent surgery for a gastrocutaneous fistula. The post-operative course has been complicated by acute worsening of anemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above the normal range, which can be caused by various factors such as pain, anxiety, or volume overload. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing wheezing and positive fluid balance, indicating possible volume overload. Diuretics may be considered to manage this condition. Additionally, a pulmonary embolism (PE) should be ruled out, and a CT angiography (CTA) may be pursued for further evaluation.

3. Anemia: Despite transfusions, there have been no significant changes in the patient's hemoglobin concentration. Rechecking the hemoglobin levels later today is recommended.

4. Gastrocutaneous fistula repair: The patient requires post-operative care as per surgical recommendations.

5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The Foley catheter was changed due to the risk of infection.

6. Seizure disorder: The patient is on dilantin until she can tolerate lamictal.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and efforts are being made to maintain glycemic control. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with elevation of the head of bed (HOB) and mouth care.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of the identified complications."

   has resp rates persistently in the 30s with sleep.  CXR this morning
   with significant rotation, difficult to interpret.  CVP at this time is
   around 14. Has been diuresing well after one time dose of lasix
   yesterday am.  Patient has wheezing on exam (primarily upper airway
   sounding), and no evidence of rales.
   - Will check ABG, IV dilaudid for pain control
   - Will give nebulizer treatment given wheeze on exam
   - Will plan for CTA today.  Will re-attempt PIV access and if unable,
   will speak with IR vs PICC team to get mid-line for contrast
   administration
   - Lasix prn if no improvement with the above
   - Will continue to monitor in the ICU for now
   # Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, PE, infection, dehydration
   - TTE performed today to evaluate for any valvular or wall motion
   abnormalities and pump function as no baseline cardiac function in the
   patient
s records
   -Have increased dilaudid to improve pain control with good effect.  Was
   changed to PO this morning, but unclear if patient is absorbing
   medications via her G-tube at this point. Will change back to IV for
   now.
   -BB TID per surgical recs, will discuss end-point for BB with surgery
   today
   -Supplemental 02 PRN
   -Continue pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
   -Plan for CTA as above.
   # BP: Initial hypotension post-op has resolved. Likely from acute blood
   loss in or around her gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No
   evidence of more distal GI bleeding.  Also on ddx for hypotension
   include sepsis, sources include surgical, urine, lungs.
   CXR/non-dedicated CT without evidence for PNA, PE.  Now pt hypertensive
   and tachycardic.  In setting of wheeze with 02 requirement, thought to
   be due to volume overload and patient was given lasix x1 yesterday
   making her 1L negative and decreasing CVP.  Patient still with
   hypertension and tachycardia though slightly improved.  Pain and
   anxiety are highest on the differential at this point for her
   hypertension and tachycardia.
   - CVP monitoring
   - Follow CXR
   - As not improved with diuresis, will plan for CTA today in conjunction
   with surgeons as above to rule out PE
   - Continue pain control, difficult to assess anxiety and patient had
   been quite sedation in the past with pain medication; can consider
   addition of ativan if CTA negative and no improvement on above regimen.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Hct has been stable over the last 24 hours after 3 units of pRBCs
   - Monitor Hct daily now
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: Restarted TF with low goal of 20/hour and
   increased to 30cc/hr.  No recent residual checks, and patient
s abdomen
   has become more distended.  Also, no recently documented bowel
   movements.
   - Check residuals over the day today with low threshold to discontinue
   TF if high
   - Bowel regimen including colace, senna, dulcolax if no recent bowel
   movements
   - Continue TF and TPN for now.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn dilaudid avoiding sedation.
   #UTI.  Pt had positive UA, cultures grew yeast while on vanc/zosyn.
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms on
   two samples with a positive UA.
   -Continue to cover broadly for infection with zosyn for urine and
   possible abdominal pathogen in post-operative setting, today is day 5.
   -Foley changed.
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin for now, will discuss returning to prior regimen
   of lamictal
   - Phenytoin level therapeutic, on high end when correcting for
   albumin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation due to Rett syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula post-ex lap and takedown, and hypotension with acute Hct drop. She is currently stable in the ICU. 

The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress with a high respiratory rate in the 30s, but appears comfortable with good oxygen saturation on 1-2L NC to RA. Her CVP has fluctuated throughout the day, ranging from 4 to 20, and has responded well to diuretics. 

The patient is hypertensive and tachycardic, with a differential diagnosis including pain, anxiety, pulmonary embolism (PE), and infection. An echocardiogram (TTE) has been performed to evaluate for any cardiac abnormalities. 

She has a history of acute blood loss anemia, likely from the gastrostomy site, and has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Her Hct has been stable over the last 24 hours, and she will continue to be monitored for any further blood loss. 

The patient has a gastrocutaneous fistula, with TF restarted at a low goal of 20/hour and increased to 30cc/hr. However, her abdomen has become more distended, and there have been no recent bowel movements. Residual checks will be done over the day to assess the TF, and bowel regimen will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 year old woman with hx of mental retardation secondary to Retts
   syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula s/p ex-lap and takedown now with
   hypotension and acute Hct drop. ICU course complicated by tachycardia,
   relative hypoxia.
    #Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, PE, infection, dehydration
   -Have increased dilaudid to increased pain control with good effect.
   -BB TID per surgical recs, will discuss end-point for BB with surgery
   today
   -Supplemental 02 PRN
   -Continue pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
   -Plan for CTA, though unable to get peripheral access. Will discuss
   plan for PICC followed by CTA with [**Doctor First Name 458**] today as well
   # BP: Initial hypotension post-op has resolved. Likely from acute blood
   loss in or around her gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No
   evidence of more distal GI bleeding.  Also on ddx for hypotension
   include sepsis, sources include surgical, urine, lungs.
   CXR/non-dedicated CT without evidence for PNA, PE.  Now pt hypertensive
   and tachycardic.  In setting of wheeze with 02 requirement, thought to
   be due to volume overload and patient was given lasix x1 yesterday
   making her 1L negative and decreasing CVP.  Patient still with
   hypertension and tachycardia though slightly improved.  Pain and
   anxiety are also on differential but less likely as pt is sleeping
   apparently comfortably. PE and sepsis less likely as pt is
   hypertensive, not hypotensive, with elevated CVPs.
   - CVP monitoring
   - Follow CXR, was poor quality yesterday am
   - As not improved with diureses, will plan for CTA today in conjunction
   with surgeons as above to rule out PE
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Hct has been stable over the last 24 hours after 3 units of pRBCs
   - Monitor Hct daily now
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: Restarted TF with low goal of 20/hour and
   increased to 30cc/hr.  Now at goal with low residuals
   - Continue TF and TPN for now.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn dilaudid avoiding sedation.
   #UTI.  Pt had positive UA, cultures grew yeast while on vanc/zosyn.
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms on
   two samples with a positive UA.
   -Continue to cover broadly for infection with zosyn for urine and

   - Continue phenytoin for now, will discuss returning to prior regimen
   of lamictal
   - Phenytoin level therapeutic, on high end when correcting for

She has been in the ICU with an ICU course complicated by tachycardia, relative hypoxia, and other medical complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

She has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including CVP monitoring, diuresis with Lasix, TPN, pain control with dilaudid, prophylactic antibiotics, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and seizure management with phenytoin.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, increased platelet count of 297 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and other abnormalities.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a paucity of bowel gas pattern on abdominal X-ray, which is a nonspecific finding. Additionally, her urine culture showed a yeast infection, and her blood cultures were negative.

The patient's medical team is considering several potential medical complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 year old woman with hx of mental retardation secondary to Retts
   syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula s/p ex-lap and takedown now with
   hypotension and acute Hct drop. ICU course complicated by tachycardia,
   relative hypoxia.
    #Tachycardia.  Ddx includes pain, anxiety, PE, infection, dehydration
   -Have increased dilaudid to increased pain control with good effect.
   -BB TID per surgical recs, will discuss end-point for BB with surgery
   today
   -Supplemental 02 PRN
   -Continue pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
   -Plan for CTA, though unable to get peripheral access. Will discuss
   plan for PICC followed by CTA with [**Doctor First Name 458**] today as well
   # BP: Initial hypotension post-op has resolved. Likely from acute blood
   loss in or around her gastrostomy site complicated by oversedated. No
   evidence of more distal GI bleeding.  Also on ddx for hypotension
   include sepsis, sources include surgical, urine, lungs.
   CXR/non-dedicated CT without evidence for PNA, PE.  Now pt hypertensive
   and tachycardic.  In setting of wheeze with 02 requirement, thought to
   be due to volume overload and patient was given lasix x1 yesterday
   making her 1L negative and decreasing CVP.  Patient still with
   hypertension and tachycardia though slightly improved.  Pain and
   anxiety are also on differential but less likely as pt is sleeping
   apparently comfortably. PE and sepsis less likely as pt is
   hypertensive, not hypotensive, with elevated CVPs.
   - CVP monitoring
   - Follow CXR, was poor quality yesterday am
   - As not improved with diureses, will plan for CTA today in conjunction
   with surgeons as above to rule out PE
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Likely from acute blood loss in or around
   gastrostomy site.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Hct has been stable over the last 24 hours after 3 units of pRBCs
   - Monitor Hct daily now
   - Guaiac stool x 3
   # Gastrocutaneous fistula: Restarted TF with low goal of 20/hour and
   increased to 30cc/hr.  Now at goal with low residuals
   - Continue TF and TPN for now.
   - Continue to follow with surgery
   - Pain control with prn dilaudid avoiding sedation.
   #UTI.  Pt had positive UA, cultures grew yeast while on vanc/zosyn.
   - Blood cultures x4 NGTD, urine cx with yeast 10-100,000 organisms on
   two samples with a positive UA.
   -Continue to cover broadly for infection with zosyn for urine and
   possible abdominal pathogen in post-operative setting, today is day 5.
   -Foley changed.
   # Seizure Disorder: no evidence of active seizures. On Lamictal at
   home, was changed to dilantin as not able to have TF
   - Continue phenytoin for now, will discuss returning to prior regimen
   of lamictal
   - Phenytoin level therapeutic, on high end when correcting for albumin.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation secondary to Rett syndrome, gastrocutaneous fistula after an exploratory laparotomy and takedown procedure.
- She is currently experiencing hypotension and acute hematocrit drop.
- The patient's ICU course has been complicated by tachycardia, relative hypoxia, and difficulty in obtaining peripheral intravenous access.
- There is a positive urine culture showing yeast growth, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for acute blood loss anemia, likely from the gastrostomy site.
- She is also being managed for a gastrocutaneous fistula, with the goal of reducing transfusion-related fluid output.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) to cover for potential abdominal and urinary pathogens.
- She has a seizure disorder, for which she is currently on phenytoin.
- The patient's pain has been managed with increased doses of dilaudid.
- Vital signs include tachypnea, grunting, sleeping, pale conjunctiva, poor dentition, and warm skin.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal liver function tests.
- Imaging reveals a nonspecific bowel gas"

","The patient is a 32-year-old female with Rett's syndrome who underwent surgery for a gastrocutaneous fistula. She has experienced complications post-operation, including blood loss anemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and an intraabdominal infection. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Zosyn) and receiving other ICU medications such as Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/76 mmHg to 150/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, central venous pressure is 17 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an input of 3,357 mL with an output of 4,525 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be anxious, with poor dentition, clear breath sounds on the left side and wheezes on the right side, a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present but hypoactive, and muscle wasting with active exhalation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Current issues: resp distress, tachycardia, hypertension, exp wheezing.
   Echo result pending. CTA once peripheral IV access obtained. Will try
   empiric nebs and low dose morphine now- no known h/o pulm dysfunction.
   Will check VBG to eval poss resp fatigue.
   #Anemia: no changes in Hct.
   #gastrocut fistula repair: post op care per Surgery. Tolerating TF
   #UTI: Foley changed.
   #Seizure disorder: on dilantin until able to tolerate lamictal

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill with respiratory distress.
","The patient is a 32-year-old female with Rett's syndrome who underwent surgery for a gastrocutaneous fistula. Her postoperative course has been complicated by blood loss, anemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and an intraabdominal infection related to the fistula. She is currently receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for the infection. 

The patient is now experiencing respiratory distress, tachypnea, and wheezing. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 164/103 to 173/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is also experiencing sinus tachycardia and has a central venous pressure of 17 mmHg. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,357 mL and total output of 4,525 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,168 mL. She is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of /27. 

Physical examination reveals an anxious and tachypneic patient with wheezing. Her eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are unremarkable. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 sounds with tachycardia."
