","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. She was admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen and presented with fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. She has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), a new right bundle branch block (RBBB), depression, seizure disorder, recurrent UTIs, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis. The patient is currently on several medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, furosemide (Lasix), levofloxacin, cymbalta, keppra, simvastatin, and steroid cream.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Atrial fibrillation/diastolic CHF: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to further decompensation of her CHF.
3. New RBBB: The presence of a new RBBB may indicate underlying cardiac pathology and requires further investigation.
4. Recurrent UTIs: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, which can be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent UTIs, and a previous CVA with residual left-sided weakness. She was admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen catheter insertion and presented with fever, shortness of breath, and likely pneumonia. The patient also has diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and new right bundle branch block. She is currently on various medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, furosemide, and cymbalta. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. She has multifocal pneumonia seen on both chest X-ray and CT angiography. Source could also be UTI.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she requires rate control. Metoprolol has been given IV, and consideration is being made for digoxin.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF, and her symptoms include 1+ bilateral pedal edema. Diuretics are being used for fluid management.
4. New right bundle branch block: The patient has developed a new RBBB, not seen on previous EKGs. An old EKG from the primary care physician will be obtained.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, PaO2 of 148, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 148.

Physical examination reveals crackles and coarse bilateral breath sounds, scattered expiratory wheezes, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and oriented neurologically. The patient's extremities are edematous, with a 2+ edema in the left leg. She is unable to stand due to weakness.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 112 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02. Other lab values include elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 3784.

The assessment and plan include respiratory distress likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic heart failure, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient will continue on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, control heart rate, diurese, and consider starting a diltiazem drip. Digoxin loading is also planned, along with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate), and her disposition remains in the ICU."

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several medical issues:

1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is showing signs of sepsis. She has been placed on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for treatment.

2. Atrial fibrillation and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has atrial fibrillation and is experiencing diastolic CHF. She has been prescribed digoxin and diuretics to manage these conditions.

3. New right bundle branch block (RBBB): The patient has developed a new RBBB, which was not present on previous EKGs. An old EKG from the patient's primary care physician (PCP) is needed for comparison. An echocardiogram (echo) has not been performed yet.

4. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with cymbalta.

5. Seizure disorder: The patient is on keppra for seizure management and seizure precautions are being followed.

6. Recurrent UTIs: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs. A repeat urine analysis (UA) and culture have been ordered.

7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is on simvastatin for high cholesterol levels.

8. Seborrheic dermatitis: The patient is using a steroid cream for seborrheic dermatitis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm. Her physical examination reveals scattered wheezes, decreased breath sounds at the bases, and pitting edema to her shins. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation and CHF, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization, and potential complications related to the seizure disorder.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment and treatment plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent UTIs, and a previous stroke with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic heart failure, new right bundle branch block, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent UTIs, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on multiple medications including diltiazem, digoxin, furosemide, pantoprazole, and cymbalta, among others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient's reported fever and shortness of breath indicate a possible infection, leading to sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, and perform further diagnostic tests such as sputum and blood cultures.

2. Atrial fibrillation with diastolic heart failure: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current symptoms suggest worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and cardiac function is necessary. Medications like digoxin and diuretics may be adjusted to manage the condition.

3. New right bundle branch block (RBBB): The presence of a new RBBB on the EKG warrants investigation. Old"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a previous stroke resulting in left-sided weakness. She was admitted with symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and likely pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for several conditions including sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a possible new right bundle branch block (RBBB).

The patient is on multiple medications including diltiazem, digoxin, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, cymbalta, keppra, simvastatin, and steroid cream for seborrheic dermatitis. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/76 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and an irregular heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (24.6 K/uL), hematocrit (29.9%), and platelet count (264). Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,573 mL and output of 3,130 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,557 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device and has a blood gas reading of ABG: ///32/.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered wheezes and decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, irregular heart rhythm, no jugular venous distention (JVD), no rash, and pitting edema to the shins. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, and she is alert and oriented.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, exacerbation of CHF, progression of atrial fibrillation, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status to ensure appropriate management and prevent further complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent urinary tract infections on suppressive therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and fluid balance issues. 

Medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening sepsis and septic shock: The patient is already showing signs of infection with pneumonia, and there is a risk of the infection spreading and leading to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and CHF, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory complications: Pneumonia and CHF can both contribute to respiratory distress, which may lead to further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with both positive and negative balances recorded. This imbalance can potentially lead to renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
5. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and the presence of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical conditions including sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), new right bundle branch block (RBBB), depression, seizure disorder, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient's reported fever and shortness of breath, along with her history of recurrent UTIs, indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis. It is crucial to closely monitor vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, and perform cultures to identify the causative organism.

2. Atrial fibrillation with diastolic CHF: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of diastolic CHF suggest a cardiac condition that needs careful management. Monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation is important. Medications such as digoxin, diuretics, and rate control measures should be considered based on the patient's condition.

3. New RBBB: The recent development of RBBB not seen on previous EKGs may indicate a cardiac conduction abnormality. Further evaluation with an old EKG from"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished, anxious individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, rate-related right bundle branch block, and a known allergy to penicillins, sulfa medications, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, and azithromycin. The patient has been off neo since 5 am with stable blood pressure. Oxygen therapy has been increased slightly to 60% FiO2, resulting in an oxygen saturation level of 95%. The patient is able to tolerate oral diltiazem and is continuing to load digoxin. 

The patient received one dose of lasix 60 mg IV in the morning due to a contraction in the electrolytes, but no additional dose was given. Zyprexa 2.5 mg was administered last night for agitation and confusion.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 83-99 bpm with an ECG showing atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 124/51 mmHg to 145/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 95% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 305 mL since midnight. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, with total intake of 1,128 mL and total output of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever, shortness of breath, and likely pneumonia. The patient has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and other comorbidities including anemia, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent UTIs, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and shortness of breath, along with a likely diagnosis of pneumonia, indicate an ongoing infection that can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Atrial fibrillation with diastolic CHF: The patient's pre-existing atrial fibrillation and the development of diastolic CHF increase the risk of complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events.
3. Recurrent UTIs: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs raises the possibility of future infections, which can be prevented through proper hygiene measures and antibiotic prophylaxis.
4. Anemia: The patient's trend in hematocrit (HCT) suggests ongoing blood loss or inadequate production, potentially due to chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

She has had a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, suggesting pneumonia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current ICU admission is for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. It is crucial to continue monitoring her vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and response to antibiotics. Regular reassessment of laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin will aid in evaluating the progression or resolution of sepsis.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and rate closely. Digoxin loading is planned to manage her atrial fibrillation. Close attention should be given to the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms related to CHF.

3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension can contribute to diastolic CHF. Monitoring her fluid status, lung sounds, and symptoms of volume overload (e.g., dyspnea, orthopnea"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic, as well as sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient also has pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CHF and AFIB, there is a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms or development of arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory infections and potential respiratory failure.
3. Infection-related complications: The patient's recent history of sepsis indicates an increased susceptibility to infections, which could lead to further septic episodes.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction, which may worsen over time.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's prolonged PT/INR indicates an increased risk of bleeding, especially if anticoagulant medications are used.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's elevated D-dimer level suggests a potential risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's impaired glucose control may contribute to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely due to pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/32-145/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and has an ABG result of ///32.

The patient has been receiving various medications including diltiazem, digoxin, senna, Zocor, Lyrica, proton pump inhibitors, cymbalta, Keppra, atrovent, albuterol nebs, and Lasix.

The laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.6 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.02, and an increased lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The imaging studies reveal an increased left-sided effusion and possible perihilar edema on chest X-ray, as well as mild aortic stenosis with an ejection fraction greater than 55% on echoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent UTIs, and a previous CVA with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia and congestive heart failure. She has been transitioned to oral diltiazem and completed a digoxin load, and is off pressors since 5 am yesterday. She experienced desaturation when turned to her left side overnight and attempted lasix diuresis yesterday. She also exhibited mild nighttime ""sundowning"" and received a one-time dose of Zyprexa.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and abnormal chest examination findings suggest a possible pneumonia.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's presentation of fever, shortness of breath, and abnormal imaging findings may indicate congestive heart failure.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and the presence of crackles on lung auscultation indicate possible hypoxia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She has had a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with fever, shortness of breath, and altered mental status, likely due to pneumonia. She also has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with volume overload. Other medical conditions include depression, seizure disorder, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and altered mental status suggest a possible pneumonia. This condition can worsen if not appropriately treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis secondary to pneumonia needs to be closely monitored and managed promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation should be managed with appropriate medications, such as digoxin, and close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's volume overload indicates diastolic CHF. Proper management with diuretics and monitoring of fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration.
5. UTIs: The patient's recurrent UTIs need to be addressed, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent future infections"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent urinary tract infections on suppressive therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. She is also experiencing sepsis secondary to pneumonia, as evidenced by her being off neosynephrine for more than 24 hours, negative urine legionella antigen, and sparse op growth in sputum culture.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic congestive heart failure. She has completed digoxin loading, and it is recommended to continue daily digoxin. Diurese with IV lasix is advised, with a goal negative 500-1L. Additionally, the patient's electrolytes should be monitored, and consideration should be given to decreasing the dose of diltiazem to 30 mg QID.

An echocardiogram reveals symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild calcific aortic stenosis and moderate pulmonary hypertension are also noted. The patient may have a new right bundle branch block, and an old EKG from the primary care physician should be obtained for comparison.

The patient has several other medical issues, including anemia, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished but anxious individual with a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute on chronic heart failure (systolic and diastolic), pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been receiving various medications including diltiazem, lasix, and coumadin. They were weaned off supplemental oxygen but still have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and mildly elevated temperature. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a low central venous pressure (CVP) and significant fluid intake and output imbalances. The patient's respiratory support includes aerosol-cool oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's physical examination shows crackles and wheezes in the chest, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurologic assessment is not performed. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other labs show normal potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Assessment and plan include heart failure, sepsis, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving antibiotics. Close monitoring for signs of deterioration and infection is crucial.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic heart failure, which may lead to worsening fluid overload and pulmonary congestion."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous cerebrovascular accident resulting in left-sided weakness. She presents with fever and shortness of breath, likely due to pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with diastolic heart failure, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and shortness of breath indicate pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continuation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is mentioned that she has AFib with rapid ventricular response. Management of atrial fibrillation should include rate control and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is also diagnosed with diastolic heart failure. Treatment options may include diuretics to manage fluid overload and medications for heart failure management.
5. Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and consider appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent UTIs, and a previous CVA resulting in left-sided weakness. She presents with fever and shortness of breath, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to pneumonia and is being treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and shortness of breath, along with the chest X-ray showing an increasing effusion and right middle lobe infiltrate, suggest pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to further respiratory distress and potential septic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the presence of fever indicate an ongoing infection. Sepsis can progress rapidly and lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly managed.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and diastolic congestive heart failure may worsen if not appropriately managed. This can result in fluid accumulation and increased symptoms of shortness of breath.
4. Recurrent UTIs: The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, which can increase the risk of complications such as kidney infection or sepsis if not effectively treated.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. If left untreated, it can lead to fatigue, weakness, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous stroke resulting in residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. Her mental status is altered, possibly due to her acute illness or hypercarbia. Oxygen saturations are improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia: The patient's sepsis is being treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. It is important to continue these antibiotics and monitor the patient's response.
2. Atrial fibrillation/diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing volume overload. Monitoring her heart rate and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed is essential.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate possible renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is necessary.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and magnesium, are abnormal. It is important to correct any imbalances to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient was more somnolent during the day after receiving zofran.
   Zofran was discontinued.  Neurologic exam unchanged.  ABG without
   hypercarbia.  Improved throughout the day.
   - digoxin level came back elevated at 2.6 so this was discontinued.  In
   the morning patient had some asymptomatic bradycardia but this resolved
   quickly
   - CVP was transduced at 5 and the decision was made to hold on further
   diuresis.  She was subsequently bolused 250 cc normal saline for low
   urine output.
   - Overnight patient had worsening oxygen requirement and crackles.

   Code status: DNI (confirmed with husband)- okay to resuscitate
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) on suppressive therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia due to likely community-acquired pneumonia compounded by fluid overload, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and low albumin levels. The patient is sensitive to even small fluid boluses.

The assessment and plan include:
- Continuing ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 8 days.
- Diuresis with IV lasix and oral diamox.
- Standing nebs and chest PT.
- Checking albumin levels and symptoms to evaluate today.
- Weaning off oxygen supplementation as tolerated, with a goal oxygen saturation of 88-92%.
- Repeating CXR in the morning.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note are sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation/diastolic CHF, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned include worsening respiratory status, fluid overload, exacerbation of CHF symptoms, and further deterioration in mental status."

","The patient is a 78-year-old woman admitted with pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory distress, accompanied by pulmonary edema. She has received small boluses for low urine output and required an increase in oxygen. IV lasix was administered, leading to improvement. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa (sulfonamides), and erythromycin ethylsuccinate. 

Her abdominal pain is related to the last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, taken on 07/16/2192 at 08:00 PM, as well as levofloxacin, also taken on 07/16/2192 at 08:00 PM.

The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including furosemide (Lasix), betamethasone, cymbalta, keppra, lyrical, and simvastatin.

There are no changes in the patient's medical, social, or family history, or review of systems, except for the mentioned conditions.

Vital signs and other data, such as hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings, are provided.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal range. Electrolytes, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), are also within normal limits. Other lab results include PT / PTT / INR, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T, lactic acid, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).

The assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Diuretics will be continued, and diamox will be given for metabolic alkalosis. The patient's hypertension and atrial fibrillation will be managed with diltiazem, and the INR will be maintained at therapeutic levels.

ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention using systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin, stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

The patient has a code status of do not intubate (DNI) and will remain in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes, and she is critically ill."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent urinary tract infections on suppressive therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/pneumonia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening of pneumonia, worsening of congestive heart failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to the patient's altered mental status.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and appropriate management of the patient's condition."

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent UTIs on suppressive therapy, and s/p CVA with residual L sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. The patient was septic on presentation, requiring neosynephrine, and now compounded by thick secretions overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/45-157/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on 100% aerosolized face mask support. The ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 70, and PaO2 of 82.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, opens eyes to commands but not following commands, PERRL, normocephalic head, regular irregular heart rhythm, 2+ DP pulses, symmetric chest expansion, inspiratory wheezes and rhonchi, soft but diffusely tender abdomen, and 1+ and 3+ edema in the right and left extremities, respectively. Neurological examination shows AO x 1, residual paralysis of the left side.

Laboratory results show WBC count of 11.6-13.1 K/uL, Hct of 26.9-29.5%, Plt of 108-160 K/uL, Cr of 0.9-1.2 mg/dL, TCO2 of 41-44 mmol/L, Glucose of 108-115 mg/dL, and other labs including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, Lactic Acid, Albumin, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 within normal ranges.

The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, lasix, diamox, diltiazem, and others. The plan includes continuing ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 8 days, sending repeat sputum CX for new thick secretions, standing nebs, chest PT, evaluating somnolent state today, weaning off O2 supplementation, and repeating CXR in the morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to pneumonia and thick secretions, further decline in mental status, fluid overload due to diastolic CHF, and constipation."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y.o. F with hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent
   UTIs on suppressive therapy, s/p CVA with residual L sided weakness,
   who presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely
   pneumonia.
   Hypoxia/PNA: Was septic on presentation transiently requiring
   neosynephrine.  Now compounded by thick secretions which increased
   overnight
 She diuresed well to lasix and Cr has bumped.  She is very
   sensitive to even small fluid boluses in setting of known diastolic CHF
   and likely low albumin (last checked [**2190**]).
   - continue ceftriaxone and levofloxacin x 8 days ([**7-19**] is last day)
   - Send repeat sputum cx for new thick secretions
   - standing nebs, chest PT
   - S&S to evaluate today
   - wean off O2 supplementation as tolerated with goal O2 88-92%
   - repeat CXR in AM
   Altered mental status:  [**Month (only) 8**] have been related to her acute illness.
   Patient remains intermittently somnolent.  Remains mildly hypercarbic.
   - recheck ABG today
   - will hold cymbalta and lyrica
   Atrial fibrillation / diastolic CHF:  Diuresed well and Cr bumpe to
   1.2.  Rate remains controlled with decreased diltiazem and
   discontinuation of supratherapeutic digoxin which was started in the
   setting of acute decompensation.
   - monitor on tele
   - continue diamox 250mg po bid with goal net even
   - cont diltiazem 30 mg QID
   - digoxin stopped
   Anemia: trend HCT
   Depression:
   - hold cymbalta
   Seizure disorder:
   - seizure precautions

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with reported fever, shortness of breath, and likely pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with hypoxia and septic pneumonia requiring neosynephrine. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/45 to 157/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and she is on aerosolized face mask support. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Her recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), increased troponin-T, and decreased albumin levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, opening eyes to commands but not following commands, presence of inspiratory wheezes and rhonchi, symmetric chest expansion, 2+ peripheral edema, and neurological deficits including residual paralysis on the left side.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 8 days, sending repeat sputum culture for new thick secretions, performing chest physical therapy, evaluating symptoms"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note, but there are several significant events that have occurred over the past 24 hours.

The patient was diuresed well with 80% of lasix IV and started diamox. They still require 100% aerosolized face mask, and their ABG shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 70, and PaO2 of 82. The patient's speech and swallow evaluation could not be conducted due to their somnolence, although they were able to take pills with applesauce.

Peripheral IV attempts were made to pull CVL, but only one could be obtained. The next day, a PICC line will be attempted. The patient experienced thick secretions overnight.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa (sulfonamides), erythromycin ethylsuccinate, and azithromycin (Zithromax oral). The last dose of antibiotics administered was levofloxacin on 07/16/2019 at 08:00 PM, and ceftriaxone on 07/17/2019 at 08:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history mentioned in the note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous cerebrovascular accident resulting in residual left-sided weakness. She presented with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with hypoxia due to likely pneumonia compounded by fluid overload. She also has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and shortness of breath indicate a likely diagnosis of pneumonia. If not treated promptly and effectively, the infection can worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient is sensitive to even small fluid boluses due to known diastolic heart failure and likely low albumin levels. If not managed appropriately, fluid overload can exacerbate heart failure symptoms and increase the risk of pulmonary edema.
3. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. If sepsis progresses, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications. It is important to manage her heart rate and rhythm to prevent further complications.
5. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with respiratory distress, pneumonia (PNA), and pulmonary edema. She has been vigorously suctioned and diuresed overnight. The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa drugs, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, and azithromycin. She received antibiotics including levofloxacin and ceftriaxone. The patient is on multiple ICU medications such as keppra, zocor, senna, albuterol, diltiazem, and diamox. There are no changes in her medical and family history, review of systems, or flow sheet data except where noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is still hypoxemic, indicating a potential risk of worsening respiratory distress. The chest X-ray shows left lower lobe (LLL) collapse versus effusion, and a chest CT will be done to assess the difference. An echocardiogram with bubble study will be performed to rule out a shunt.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing metabolic alkalosis due to respiratory acidosis and volume contraction. Treating the volume contraction component with diamox will be initiated.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF is well-controlled on diltiazem.
4. Potential Infections: The presence of PNA suggests a risk of developing further infections. Close monitoring of vital"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent UTIs on suppressive therapy, and a previous CVA with residual left-sided weakness. She presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. She is currently experiencing hypoxia despite receiving antibiotics and diuretics. The patient has increased thick secretions, but her saturation improves with suctioning. A bubble study shows no intracardiac shunt. Her current medications include ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, diuretics, diamox IV, diltiazem, and discontinuation of supratherapeutic digoxin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and increased thick secretions suggest the possibility of pneumonia. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotics and monitor for improvement in symptoms and oxygen saturation levels.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia despite good diuretics and antibiotics raises concerns about respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and consideration of non-invasive ventilation support may be necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and her history of atrial fibrillation. Prophylactic anticoagulation with coumadin is already being administered.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent UTIs on suppressive therapy, and a history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/pneumonia, with initial septic presentation requiring neosynephrine. Despite good diuresis and antibiotics, the patient continues to experience persistent hypoxia. There is a question of a possible shunt given the patient's oxygen saturation of 82% on 100% FiO2 yesterday. The patient has increased thick secretions but has shown improvement with frequent suctioning. A CT chest showed small bilateral pleural effusions and thick secretions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/32 mmHg to 133/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on high-flow oxygen via a nebulizer.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab results are within normal range.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, recurrent urinary tract infections, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual left-sided weakness. She was admitted with reported fever and shortness of breath, suspected to be pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia despite good diuretics and antibiotics.

Upon admission, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 84 bpm, blood pressure 92/32 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 91%. She is currently on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.39, PaCO2 45 mmHg, and PaO2 80 mmHg on FiO2 100%.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, opening eyes to commands but not following commands, irregular heart rhythm, 2+ distal pulses, and diffuse tactile peripheral edema on both extremities. Neurological examination shows alert orientation to person, place, and time, but with residual paralysis on the left side.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 72 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other labs including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxia/pneumonia, altered mental status, constipation, atrial fibrillation with diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

The plan includes obtaining a CT chest for better evaluation of pneumonia, performing a repeat chest X-ray, conducting a bubble study to evaluate for intracardiac shunt, continuing ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 8 days, diuresis, treatment of high bicarbonate with diamox (switching to IV), monitoring sputum culture for new thick secretions, performing standing nebs and chest PT, weaning off O2 supplementation as tolerated with goal O2 88-92%, rechecking ABG, and holding cymbalta and lyrica.

The patient's medical complications include potential drug rash due to penicillin allergy, hypercarbic narcosis, constipation, atrial fibrillation with diastolic CHF, anemia, depression, seizure disorder, recurrent UTIs, hypercholesterolemia, and seborrheic dermatitis."

   Imaging: EEG [**2192-7-19**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and
   slow
   background throughout. This indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but
   encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Chest CT [**2192-7-18**]: Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and
   worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular atelectasis. Airway
   secretions as described.
   Echocardiogram [**2192-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac
   shunt is suggested with intravenous saline contrast at rest x 2
   (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers). There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.

   encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Chest CT [**2192-7-18**]: Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and
   worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular atelectasis. Airway
   secretions as described.
   Echocardiogram [**2192-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac
   shunt is suggested with intravenous saline contrast at rest x 2
   (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers). There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.

She presented with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. The patient had altered mental status initially but now only opens eyes to commands and is not following commands. She has widespread encephalopathy on EEG without focal seizures. She is currently on diamox IV, hold cymbalta and lyrica, and considering a head CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium or worsening encephalopathy.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of systolic and diastolic heart failure, which could worsen if not properly managed.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient has completed her course of antibiotics for pneumonia, there is still a risk of sepsis due to other potential infections.
4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's fever needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): There is a risk of worsening or complications related to pneumonia.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to prevent further complications.

   Imaging: EEG [**2192-7-19**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and

   background throughout. This indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but
   encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Chest CT [**2192-7-18**]: Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and
   worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular atelectasis. Airway
   secretions as described.
   Echocardiogram [**2192-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac
   shunt is suggested with intravenous saline contrast at rest x 2
   (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers). There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.

   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most

   encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform
   features.
   Chest CT [**2192-7-18**]: Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and
   worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular atelectasis. Airway
   secretions as described.
   Echocardiogram [**2192-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac
   shunt is suggested with intravenous saline contrast at rest x 2
   (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers). There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of sepsis, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. He is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, fever, and widespread encephalopathy. The patient has completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia and is now on diamox for elevated bicarbonate levels. He is unable to obtain a PICC line due to an elevated INR. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low blood pressure and high heart rate. His respiratory support includes high flow nebulization with oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His renal function is normal, but his liver enzymes are slightly elevated. The patient's imaging results indicate worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular atelectasis, as well as increased small bilateral pleural effusions. The echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, but no intracardiac shunt is suggested. The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, heart failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening encephalopathy: The patient's widespread encephalopathy indicates a disturbance in brain function. If left untreated, it could lead to"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y.o. F with hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent
   UTIs on suppressive therapy, s/p CVA with residual L sided weakness,
   who presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely
   pneumonia.
   Altered mental status:  Patient remains intermittently somnolent and
   delerious.  EEG r/o seizure.  Likely toxic-metabolic.
   - Head CT
   - Eval for UTI
   Hypoxia/PNA: Was septic on presentation transiently requiring
   neosynephrine. Persistence of hypoxia despite good diureses and s/p
   course of abx. Likely multifactorial: thick secretions, bilateral
   pleural effusions, and atelectasis.  Patient improves with frequent
   suction and has very weak cough.
   - Standing nebs, chest PT
   - Wean O2
   - Gentle diuresis
   Rash:  Concerning for drug rash.  Patient has allergies to both
   penicillins and sulfa drugs.  Ceftriaxone discontinued but
   acetazolamide continued for now.
   - Monitor rash
   - Consider switching to non-sulfa containing diuretics if worsens
   Atrial fibrillation / diastolic CHF:  Diuresed well.  Rate remains
   controlled with decreased diltiazem and off digoxin.
   - Cont to wean diltiazem

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent urinary tract infections on suppressive therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. The patient presents with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely pneumonia. 

The patient remains intermittently somnolent and delirious, with an altered mental status. An EEG has ruled out seizure activity, suggesting that the altered mental status is likely due to toxic-metabolic causes. 

The patient was initially septic on presentation and transiently required neosynephrine. Despite good diuresis and treatment with antibiotics, the patient continues to experience hypoxia, likely due to multifactorial causes including thick secretions, bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis. 

The patient's condition improves with frequent suction and has a weak cough. 

The patient has developed a rash, which is concerning for a drug rash. The patient has allergies to both penicillins and sulfa drugs. Ceftriaxone has been discontinued, but acetazolamide is being continued for now. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) have been managed with diuresis. The rate remains controlled with decreased diltiazem and off digoxin. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recurrent UTIs on suppressive therapy, and a previous CVA resulting in left-sided weakness. She was admitted with reported fever and shortness of breath, likely due to pneumonia. The patient remains intermittently somnolent and delirious, with an EEG ruling out seizure. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfa drugs.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/39 to 119/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure of 8 mmHg. Her weight is currently 110.8 kg, and her height is 64 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, hemoglobin level of 27.0 g/dL, platelet count of 208 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 100 to 124 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.
