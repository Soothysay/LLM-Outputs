   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - f/u Lipid profile
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Hold ACE in setting of worsening renal function
   - Wean nitro drip as able
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure
   - TTE today to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - will continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip overnight
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will keep NPO for now
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and heart disease. She was admitted from an outside hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent coronary angiography with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient's current condition includes acute heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, potentially due to an ischemic event during her last admission. She has elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac injury. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 56% on an adenosine stress test performed less than a month ago. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

Other medical issues include chronic renal failure, requiring ongoing HD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently on multiple sedating medications, which may contribute to her altered mental status (AMS). She is also being managed for gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, further cardiac events, electrolyte imbalances, and infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, cardiac"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation one month ago. She was admitted from another facility with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent coronary angiography with stenting in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/30-85/19 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T levels. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows new ST-segment depressions in multiple leads.

The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta-blocker, and amiodarone. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Unclear timing of NSTEMI and may have been on
   prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Lipid profile in am
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Hold ACE in setting of worsening renal function
   - Wean nitro drip as able
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure
   - TTE in am to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - will continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Will attempt to wean down nitro overnight, however, unable to give PO
   meds given AMS so may need to continue for now until able to take POs
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will keep NPO for now
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.
   #. GERD: Will continue PPI
   #. HL: will continue statin
   FEN: Cardiac diet post cath
   ACCESS: peripheral line in foot and Right IJ triple lumen which was
   placed at OSH [**2173-3-30**], a-line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), and heart failure (HF), who was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and received dual-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient's current condition includes acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, altered mental status (AMS), and possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 66-71 bpm, blood pressure of 123/30 mmHg with a range of 85/19-123/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with inspiration, oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 7 cm.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 21.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.4%, platelet count of 366, creatinine of 8.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 104 mg/dL, and troponin-T elevated at 22 mEq/L. Other labs indicate elevated PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, and alkaline phosphatase, with normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Coronaries: The patient had a recent NSTEMI, and it is unclear about the timing of the event. She may have had an ischemic event during her previous admission, which could have led to acute CHF exacerbation. With elevated troponin levels on this admission, it is more likely that she had an ischemic event during the last admission. The plan includes continuing aspirin, Plavix, statin, beta-blocker, and monitoring lipid profile.
2. Pump: The patient had an ejection fraction of 56% on adenosine stress test performed at OSH less than one month ago. It is suspected that her admission for ""multifocal pneumonia"" was actually an acute CHF exacerbation. With elevated troponin levels on this admission, it is possible that she had an ischemic event during the last admission. The plan includes performing a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess pump function and wall motion abnormalities (WMA), as well as monitoring daily weights.
3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The plan includes continuing am"

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). 

Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor. She is also on amiodarone for rhythm control and nitroglycerin for blood pressure control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 125/30 mmHg and heart rate of 72 bpm. Oxygen saturation is at 98% on room air. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of lethargy. Her physical examination reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with normal cavity size, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction >75%), and diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. There is mild aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation, and trivial mitral regurgitation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), with"

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Can start ACE as she has end stage renal failure
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip yesterday
   - continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: improved likely was secondary to sedation medication and no
   dialysis..
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat schedule
   . Renal aware, will get HD tomorrow

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Discontinue ACE
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent coronary angiography and placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). Her current complaints include neck and chest pain, with EKG showing ST depressions laterally and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

Medical Complications:
1. LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function and diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
2. Mild aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
3. Unclear timing of NSTEMI, possibly related to a previous admission.
4. History of acute CHF exacerbation one month ago.
5. History of severe hypertension and elevated pressures in the cath lab.
6. History of atrial fibrillation (AF) and use of amiodarone.
7. Chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis.
8. GERD treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
9. Hyperlipidemia treated with statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation one month ago. She was admitted from the operating room (OSH) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent coronary angiography with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient has had a significant medical history, including a previous admission for multifocal pneumonia that was likely due to acute CHF exacerbation. She also had elevated troponin levels on this admission but normal creatine kinase (CK) levels, suggesting a possible ischemic event during the last admission leading to acute CHF and now only with elevated troponin levels due to her renal failure. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor for her end-stage renal disease. She continues to require ongoing monitoring and management for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's history of NSTEMI and placement of DES, there is a risk of recurrent"

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Discontinue ACE
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: improved likely was secondary to sedation medication and no
   dialysis..
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, (at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat
   schedule)
   .
   #. GERD: Will continue PPI
   #. HL: will continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), and heart disease. She was admitted to the ICU for acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).
- She complains of neck and chest pain today, with EKG showing ST depressions and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
- The patient has allergies to Demerol, sulfa antibiotics, promethazine, and an unknown allergy.
- She is currently receiving fentanyl, pantoprazole, and other medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the complaints mentioned above.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/30 mmHg to 158/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight positive fluid balance.
- The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and creatinine levels.

   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted
   hydral this AM.  Will likely need HD today
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart home nifedipine
   # AMS:  Pt has severe depression.  Most likely her depression is

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and heart failure (HL). She was admitted from the operating room (OSH) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent coronary angiography with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for subjective dysphagia. The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, chest pain, and elevated blood pressures. She has received various medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, beta-blocker, amiodarone, metoprolol, nifedipine, zyprexa, and zoloft. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous distention (JVD), soft heart sounds with reduced intensity of S1 and S2, clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no extremity edema. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 201/50 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and heart failure (HF). She was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent coronary angiography with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

Since admission, the patient has experienced several medical complications. She reported feeling shortness of breath (SOB) and a sense of impending doom, with an EKG showing ST depressions. The patient's blood pressures have been significantly elevated, requiring multiple interventions including increasing doses of metoprolol and initiating a nitroglycerin drip. She also received a blood transfusion overnight and required additional fluid resuscitation due to bleeding from a graft during HD.

The patient's mental status has been variable, with episodes of lethargy and confusion. She has a history of severe depression and may be experiencing pseudo-dementia due to ICU psychosis. Psychiatric consultation was obtained, and she was restarted on her home medication of Zoloft. Social work consultation was also obtained.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted
   hydral this AM.
   -          continue metoprolol
   -          Restart home nifedipine
   #. AMS:  Pt has severe depression.  Most likely her depression is
   causing a pseudo dementia on top of ICU psychosis.  Attempted zyprexa
   last night with not much effect.  Restarted home Zoloft.  Consulted
   Psych yesterday
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, (at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat
   schedule)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and received drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending artery and left main coronary artery. The timing of the NSTEMI is unclear, and it may have occurred during her prior admission. The patient had elevated blood pressures and symptoms consistent with demand ischemia. She was started on nitroglycerin drip and metoprolol but required additional medication to control her blood pressure. The patient also presented with severe depression and was started on Zoloft. She experienced episodes of altered mental status, which were attributed to ICU psychosis. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is on a hemodialysis schedule at home on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. She also has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hyperlipidemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to possible restenosis of the coronary arteries or new arterial blockages.
2. Hypertensive emergency or urgency due to uncontrolled blood pressure.
3. Chronic kidney disease progression leading to further decline in renal function.
4. Respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), impaired skin integrity, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and feeling like a ""heart attack."" She also reported nausea, chest pain, and high blood pressure readings throughout the day. The patient received multiple consultations, including renal dialysis, iron studies, psychiatric evaluation for depression and delirium/dementia, speech and swallow evaluation, social work consultation, and transfusion of one unit of blood due to a dropped blood pressure during hemodialysis.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following medical complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure readings were significantly elevated, indicating a hypertensive crisis. This can lead to end-organ damage if not promptly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD, which may be exacerbated by the recent episode of hypotension during hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to factors such as poor circulation or pressure ulcers caused by prolonged immobility in the ICU.
4. Myocardial infarction: Given the patient's history of CAD and AMI, there is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent coronary angiography with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient has been experiencing symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), chest pain (CP), and feeling like a ""heart attack."" Her vital signs show elevated blood pressure (BP) readings ranging from 201/50 mmHg to 231/126 mmHg, and her heart rate (HR) has been within normal limits. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) has been maintained at 99% with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm, and a soft S2 heart sound peaking early at the right upper sternal border (RUSB). There are no crackles or wheezes heard in the lungs, and her abdomen is soft with no tenderness. Neurological assessment shows lethargy but arousable.

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted
   hydral this AM.  Will likely need HD today
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart home nifedipine
   # AMS:  Pt has severe depression.  Most likely her depression is
   causing a pseudo dementia on top of ICU psychosis.  Attempted zyprexa
   last night with not much effect.  Restarted home Zoloft.  Consulted
   Psych yesterday.  SW to see her today
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, (at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat
   schedule)
   # GERD: Will continue PPI
   # HL: will continue statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted from another hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where drug-eluting stents (DES) were placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient's current condition includes acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe depression, and chronic renal failure requiring regular HD sessions. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Acute CHF exacerbation due to demand ischemia or ongoing myocardial injury.
   - Ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.
   - Hypertensive urgency or emergency due to uncontrolled blood pressure.

2. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to inadequate hemodialysis, fluid overload, or medication-related nephrotoxicity.
   - Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia)"
