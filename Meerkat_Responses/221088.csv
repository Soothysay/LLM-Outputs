","Summary:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation. Physical examination reveals a slightly erythematous left eyelid, faint heart sounds, a 3/6 systolic murmur, regular rhythm, trace bilateral edema to ankles, and clear lungs bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, with normal hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and potential shock if not managed promptly.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as medication side effects, infection, or underlying cognitive impairment. It is important to monitor and address any potential underlying causes to prevent further deterioration.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent DVT formation.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation, who presents with recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable hemodynamically. The bleeding is likely secondary to diverticula visualized on recent colonoscopy. The patient has been placed on NPO status and started on pantoprazole 40 mg IV bid. He is also receiving two units of type and crossmatched blood. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 96.3°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 127/64 mmHg. He is on supplemental oxygen at 98%. Physical examination reveals trace bilateral edema to the ankles, warm extremities, and no other significant findings. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and stable platelet count. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's altered mental status is not due to delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. It is important to monitor his thyroid hormone levels and adjust the medication dose accordingly.

","Summary:
- The patient is an 88-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
- He presented with melanotic stools and a slow sigmoid bleed on the morning of admission.
- He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday, which increased his hemoglobin concentration from 30 to 34.
- The patient has been kept NPO (nothing by mouth), maintained active type and screen, and given pantoprazole 40 mg IV bid.
- His heart sounds are faint, and he has a 3/6 systolic murmur.
- He has trace bilateral edema to his ankles.
- His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 208 K/uL.
- He has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has recurrent lower GI bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and may require further interventions such as angiography or surgery.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, or the effects of medications. Close monitoring and optimization of these factors are crucial.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed carefully"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an EKG and nuclear medicine scan on [**2183-4-9**]. The bleeding scan showed positive results, and deferred angiography was planned for the morning. The patient has a history of allergies to antibiotics, but no information is provided regarding the specific type. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate between 76-99 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate at 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an acceptable fluid balance. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses and unassessed skin, neurologic, and respiratory status. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with normal electrolyte levels and kidney function. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent or worsening gastrointestinal bleeding: This complication needs immediate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old individual with atrial fibrillation who has undergone ablation and is currently not on anticoagulation due to a likely diverticular bleed in mid-late [**Month (only) **] at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 78**]. The patient was readmitted on [**4-6**] with persistent hematochezia and was transferred for possible interventional radiology (IR) intervention. The patient underwent a colonoscopy on [**4-8**] and a descending colon bleed was seen which was injected with epinephrine and resulting hemostasis was observed. However, the patient developed increased hematochezia and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed, showing a positive result. After discussion with IR, the decision was made to monitor the patient closely but intervene later. The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells since admission (7 units overall). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/53 mmHg to 136/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

   Continued intermittent LGIB.  Unable to get IR embolization as bleed is
   too slow, so will continue watching.  If bleeds again, will get another
   RBC scan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (hx ablation) who is off anticoagulation due to a likely diverticular bleed. The patient was readmitted with persistent hematochezia and underwent a colonoscopy on [**4-8**], during which a descending colon bleed was seen and injected with epinephrine, resulting in hemostasis. However, the patient continues to experience large amounts of hematochezia, and a tagged red blood cell scan was positive. The decision was made to monitor the patient closely but defer intervention. The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells since admission.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/53 mmHg to 136/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has been experiencing intermittent lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The bleeding is thought to be due to a diverticular bleed, and the patient has been monitored closely without immediate intervention.

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit level of 33.6%, which indicates anemia. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies, including a tagged red blood cell scan"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with altered mental status and requires active management for his GI bleed. The patient received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells and his hemoglobin concentration is stable. He is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) for gastric protection and has had a negative nuclear medicine study. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he has a faint heart sound with a 3/6 systolic murmur. Physical examination reveals trace bilateral edema to the ankles, warm extremities, and no rashes or skin changes. The patient's laboratory values are largely unremarkable, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of recurrent GI bleeding and the positive bleeding scan in the sigmoid area indicate a risk for ongoing or future bleeding episodes.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's presentation with altered mental status may be attributed to the GI bleed, resulting in decreased oxygenation and perfusion to the brain.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, although rate-controlled at home, poses a risk for potential hemodynamic instability and further complications such as thromboembolism.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's underlying hypothyroidism should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (hx ablation) who is off anticoagulation due to a likely diverticular bleed in mid-late [**Month (only) **] at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 78**]. He was readmitted there on [**4-6**] with persistent hematochezia and was transferred for possible interventional radiology (IR) intervention. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/71 to 142/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm. 

The patient has received infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. He has been on a PO diet and monitored. His labs show a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 219 K/uL, platelet count of 228 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 77 to 84 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hematochezia - likely diverticular bleed, continues with inappropriate bump to PRBC transfusion but hemodynamic stability. Tagged RBC scan positive for slow diverticular colon bleed but subsequent CT angiography negative. IR has received expectant management.
   - Hct q12 today
   - Start po diet and monitor
2. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled, off anticoagulation due to #1.
   - Holding rate control for possible hemodynamic instability
   - Will resume coumadin today or tomorrow
3. Hypothyroidism - continue Synthroid
4. Possible left eye conjunctivitis - scant clear discharge
   - Prn artificial tears
5. Basilar crackles - likely atelectasis
   - PT
   - Get pt OOB

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding of the diverticular bleed
2. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization
3. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further atelectasis
4. Worsening of atrial fibrillation and potential need for cardioversion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old individual with atrial fibrillation who underwent an ablation procedure and is currently off anticoagulation due to a previous diverticular bleed. The patient was readmitted to the hospital with persistent hematochezia and was transferred for possible interventional radiology (IR) intervention. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/71 mmHg to 142/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 907 mL and a total output of 1,525 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 618 mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the left lung base, right lower extremity edema (absent), left lower extremity edema (absent), and warm skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 219 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 77 mg/dL and 84 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL"
