","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presents with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely due to diverticular bleeding. The patient has experienced significant blood loss, requiring multiple blood transfusions. Despite this, he continues to bleed actively, as indicated by tachycardia. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 26% to 23% after receiving additional units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's ongoing blood loss can lead to decreased blood volume, resulting in inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potential shock.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient may develop coagulopathy due to dilutional effects from blood transfusions and ongoing blood loss.
3. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): If the patient's condition worsens, it can lead to systemic inflammation and dysfunction of multiple organs.
4. Respiratory Failure: Severe blood loss can cause decreased oxygen carrying capacity, leading to respiratory distress and potential failure.
5. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's ongoing blood loss and potential use of nephrotoxic medications may compromise renal function.
7. Stroke/TIA: Hypotension and coagulopathy increase the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a past medical history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which is believed to be caused by diverticular bleeding. The patient has been transfused a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing bleeding and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 26 to 23.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/66 mmHg to 152/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is alert and oriented, with clear lung sounds and no murmurs or pedal edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin concentration of 25.8% and 23.0%, platelet count of 285 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 102 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (Na+ 24 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (K+ 10.2 mEq/L). Other lab values are within normal range.

Plan:
The patient is currently being managed in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have diverticular bleeding. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight, but his hemoglobin level is still low at 25%. He continues to bleed, and additional units of PRBCs are being given. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is currently fasting (NPO) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pantoprazole (PPI). He is planned for a colonoscopy today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing blood loss.
2. Development of shock if the bleeding cannot be controlled.
3. Acute kidney injury from hypoperfusion or volume depletion.
4. Infection due to invasive procedures or immunosuppression from ongoing bleeding.
5. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
6. Metabolic disturbances such as electrolyte imbalances or hypoglycemia.
7. Coagulopathy from dilution"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing bleeding. His hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped from 26 to 23 after transfusion. The initial tagged red blood cell scan was negative, but the patient continues to bleed. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with IV fluids and pantoprazole (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The plan is to perform a colonoscopy today to identify the source of the bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.2 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 285 K/uL, and normal creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued or re-bleeding: Despite receiving blood transfusions, the patient continues to bleed,"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 8083**] has had fresh hematochezia with urgency last night and a
   need for 2 more units of pRBC
s. If his colonoscopy shows features of
   active bleeding, he will need a nuclear medicine scan and IR guided
   embolization. Surgical colleagues also following. INR is 1.1 today too.
   If he has continued need for further transfusion, he will have a cordis
   catheter placed at bedside to aid rescucitation.
   Patient is ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He experienced a sudden onset of bloody stools and was found to have hematochezia, which is bleeding from the lower GI tract. The patient received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) between the outside hospital (OSH) and the current facility.

The patient initially had planned colonoscopy, but the preparation was inadequate, so it was postponed until the next morning. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level was stable between 2 pm and 8 pm, but at 3 am, it dropped by 4 points, prompting the administration of additional 2 units of PRBC. The patient's coagulation profile shows an INR of 1.1, indicating a mild elevation. 

The patient is currently being managed with nothing by mouth (NPO) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pantoprazole (PPI). The plan is to perform a colonoscopy tomorrow morning after administering magnesium citrate for bowel preparation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 123/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). He has received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) between the outside hospital (OSH) and the current facility. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level was initially stable but dropped by 4 points at 3 am, prompting the administration of additional PRBC. A colonoscopy was initially planned but was postponed due to inadequate preparation, and now it is scheduled for tomorrow morning after administration of magnesium citrate for bowel preparation. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pantoprazole (Protonix). He has two peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs), and central access is anticipated later today. Aspirin has been held due to the bleed. The patient's tagged red blood cell scan was unremarkable two days ago, but he continues to bleed. Coagulation parameters, specifically INR, will be closely monitored for dilutional coagulopathy. The patient's other medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism and hypertension, will be managed accordingly. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). He has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) between the hospital and here. A colonoscopy was performed, revealing diverticulosis but no source of bleeding identified. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 25.8% to 24.0% overnight, and he continues to have bloody stools. The tagged red blood cell scan was unremarkable two days ago, so a repeat tagged RBC followed by angiogram will be considered when the bleeding recurs. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pantoprazole (Protonix). He has been placed on full code status and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the transfusion of PRBCs, the patient's Hct has continued to drop, indicating ongoing blood loss or re-bleeding. Close monitoring and prompt intervention will be necessary to manage this complication.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged NPO status increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole and pneumatic boots for deep vein thrombosis prevention should help reduce the risk of infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected to be caused by diverticular bleeding. The patient has received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) between the hospital and here. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed blood in the colon and diverticulosis but no source of active bleeding identified. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped to 24% this morning, below the target range of 28-30%. The patient will be transfused with another unit of PRBCs today. A repeat tagged red blood cell scan followed by angiogram will be considered if the bleeding recurs. The patient is currently nil per os (NPO) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pantoprazole (Protonix). He is maintained on two peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) and his antiplatelet medication (ASA) has been withheld due to the bleed. Coagulation will be monitored for potential dilutional coagulopathy. The patient's hypothyroidism will continue to be managed with levothyroxine. His hypertension medications have been held due to the GI bleed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) thought to be diverticular in nature. The patient has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) since admission, with the last unit being given at 3am on [**7-27**]. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been stable throughout the day, ranging from 24% to 28%. The patient underwent a colonoscopy which showed blood in the colon and diverticulosis, but no source of bleeding was identified. He is currently maintained on intravenous fluids and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His blood glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Given the patient's history of diverticular bleeding, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the source of bleeding was not completely addressed during the colonoscopy.
2. Infection: As the patient is immobilized and receiving invasive procedures, he is at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, which can lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has received a substantial amount of blood products, which can lead to dilutional coagulopathy. Monitoring coagulation parameters and correcting any abnormalities will be important.
5. Delirium or cognitive dysfunction: Critically ill patients often experience delirium or cognitive dysfunction. Close monitoring for changes in mental status is essential.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and further assessment may be required."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 8121**] has not needed further transfusion over the past 28 hours.
   His colonoscopy did not show an active source of blood loss. He has
   been hemodynamically stable without orthostatic change in HR too. We
   will advance to clear liquids today and assess his Hct every 8 hrs. If
   he does not need further transfusion he will leave ICU in am [**2109-7-29**]. If
   there is further hematochezia, we will need surgical intervention. He
   is distressed about the possibility of a colostomy.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which is believed to be caused by diverticular bleeding. The patient has received a total of 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion since admission. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been monitored regularly. A colonoscopy showed no active source of bleeding, but diverticulosis was observed throughout the colon. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is receiving intravenous fluids and being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Since the source of bleeding could not be identified during colonoscopy, there is a possibility of re-bleeding. If this occurs, the patient may require further transfusions or surgical intervention.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the critical illness and prolonged stay in the ICU. This increases the risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. Coagulopathy: Due to the large volume of blood transfusions received, the patient may develop dilutional coagulopathy. Monitoring of coagulation parameters is important to detect and manage this condition.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it is essential to continue levothyroxine supplementation as per the usual medical history.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient has received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) between the outside hospital (OSH) and the current facility. 

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable, with no evidence of bleeding yesterday or overnight. However, there was a slight decrease in Hct this morning. The patient tolerated advancement to clear liquids yesterday and is scheduled for a colonoscopy at 11:30 am today. 

The patient will continue to be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Central access is planned for later today. Aspirin has been held due to the bleed, and the patient's coagulation status will be monitored, particularly for dilutional coagulopathy given the significant volume of IV fluids administered. 

The patient's other medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism and hypertension, will be managed with Levothyroxine and holding anti-hypertensive medications, respectively. The patient's nutritional needs will be met through IVF, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be implemented.
