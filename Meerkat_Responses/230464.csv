","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently in the ICU. They have a history of fever, urinary tract infection, and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate between 66-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-166/58-111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an overall fluid balance of +5,886 mL, with a total input of 9,136 mL and a total output of 3,250 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of oxygen delivery devices, with an SpO2 level of 98%. The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and normal heart sounds. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal troponin T levels. Other lab values indicate elevated levels of lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of obstructing left renal stone, suprapubic catheter (neurogenic bladder s/p CVA), and numerous urinary tract infections (UTIs). He presents with fever, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely originating from a UTI. He has grown pseudomonas from urine cultures in the past. The patient's medical conditions include type 1 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, depression, and pain management. He is currently receiving various medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, lethargy, and hypotension suggests sepsis, likely originating from a UTI. This condition requires immediate attention and treatment to prevent further complications.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's history of growing pseudomonas from urine cultures indicates a potential risk for pseudomonas infection. This organism is known for its resistance to multiple antibiotics and can cause severe infections.
3. Renal complications: The patient's history of obstructing left renal stone and neurogenic bladder may increase the risk of renal complications such as pyelonephritis or renal abscess. Further evaluation, such as a follow-up CT abdomen, may be necessary to assess these possibilities.
4. Diabetes management: The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, which requires careful management of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chronic foot pain. A CT scan revealed a catheter in the ureter, which was removed and replaced by urology. The patient has no known drug allergies and received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Meropenem, and Vancomycin) within the last 24 hours. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and omeprazole for stress ulcers. 

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/79 mmHg to 152/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an intake of 1,940 mL and output of 2,880 mL since midnight. The patient is not on respiratory support and has normal ABG results. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and symmetric chest expansion. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There are no extremity pulses detected on the right side, and the left side has diminished pulses. The patient's neurological examination is essentially unremarkable. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit and increased creatinine levels. Troponin-T is within normal range,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of obstructing left renal stone, suprapubic catheter (neurogenic bladder post cerebrovascular accident), and numerous urinary tract infections. He presented to the ICU with fever, lethargy, and hypotension from a day care center. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis likely originating from a urinary tract infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified in his urine. He is currently receiving intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics until further blood and urine cultures are available. Other assessments include type 1 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, depression, and chronic pain, for which he is taking lantus, lispro, and lispor for diabetes management, simvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and celexa for depression. The patient's code status is full, meaning he is willing to undergo any life-saving measures if necessary. He is expected to be transferred to the floor once his condition improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of multiple UTIs, and the current presentation suggests a likely source of sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
3. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: The identified pathogen in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of obstructing left renal stone, suprapubic catheter (neurogenic bladder s/p CVA), s/p colectomy for SBO, and numerous UTIs. He presents with fever, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely originating from the urinary tract given his history of recurrent UTIs. He has been hemodynamically stable for the past 24 hours, and his white blood cell count is trending down. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), meropenem, omeprazole (Prilosec), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). He also has multiple medical conditions, such as type I diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, depression, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's history of recurrent UTIs increases the risk of complications related to the urinary tract, such as kidney stones or kidney damage.
3. Neurogenic bladder: The patient has a neurogenic bladder due to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which may lead to difficulties in controlling urination"
