   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute
   coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a
   long-standing history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in
   our record.  His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers
   prior to presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **] remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin (changing levofloxacin to azithromycin as patient was on
   levofloacin as an outpatient)
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even to -500 cc
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: His coronary history in the setting of ECG
   changes and a positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  Q waves on EKG
   indicate STEMI.  The value of his cardiac enzymes are unlikely to
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt for now until further
   evaluation by cardiology
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade once blood pressure allows
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin for now pending cultures
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   - Consider CT chest if stable
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline mid-30s
 hematocrit drop from 30
   to 26 overnight without obvious source of bleeding.  Patient on heparin
   gtt and integrillin gtt.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced
   HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Transfused 1U PRBC overnight
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Consider CT abdomen to rule out RP bleed if no appropriate bump after
   transfusion
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improved.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, CAD, and a history of tobacco abuse, presenting with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure. The patient's chest x-ray is unrevealing, but he had fevers prior to presentation. Bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP, and Bordetella bronchisepticum remain on the differential; a CT chest is planned for further evaluation when stable.

The patient is maintained on Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for [Doctor First Name] prophylaxis as an outpatient. He has acute systolic congestive heart failure with an apparent decrease in ejection fraction from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchospasm/obstruction as primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing. Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD. Will continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin (changing levofloxacin to azithromycin as the patient was on levofloxacin as an outpatient).

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced HIV/AIDS presenting transferred from OSH
   with respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with infection and acute coronary
   syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a long-standing
   history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in our record.
   His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers prior to
   presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **]
   remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced HIV/AIDS presenting with respiratory failure. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, primarily caused by bronchospasm/obstruction. Other contributing factors include infection and acute coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD, but no pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are recorded. The chest x-ray is unrevealing, and further evaluation with a CT chest is recommended when the patient is stable. The patient is maintained on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis as an outpatient.

2. Acute systolic congestive heart failure: The patient has acute systolic CHF with a significant decrease in ejection fraction from 30% to 15%. He is currently on Solu-Medrol and Combivent for COPD exacerbation. Mini-BAL is planned for bronchial culture & gram stain, Legionella culture, rapid respiratory viral screen & culture, Pneumocystis smear, CMV culture, acid-fast (TB) culture & smear, and fungal culture. Goal I/O evenness is desired, and consideration for diuresis in blood pressure-stable patients is recommended.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's coronary history"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute
   coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a
   long-standing history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in
   our record.  His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers
   prior to presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **] remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even to -500 cc
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: His coronary history in the setting of ECG
   changes and a positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  Q waves on EKG
   indicate STEMI.  The value of his cardiac enzymes are unlikely to
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.  Cardiac
   enzymes starting to trend down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt for now until further
   evaluation by cardiology
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade once blood pressure allows
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin for now pending cultures
   plan to discontinue at 48 hours if cultures negative
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   - Consider CT chest if stable
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline mid-30s
 hematocrit drop from 30
   to 26 overnight without obvious source of bleeding.  Patient on heparin
   gtt and integrillin gtt.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced
   HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Transfused 1U PRBC overnight
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Consider CT abdomen to rule out RP bleed if no appropriate bump after
   transfusion
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with

   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improved.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS and CAD who was transferred to the ICU from OSH with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and a history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with fevers prior to presentation and possible infection or PCP contributing to the respiratory failure. He also has acute systolic congestive heart failure with a decrease in ejection fraction from 30% to 15%. The patient is on multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiretrovirals, prophylactic medications, and cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely due to bronchospasm/obstruction, probable infection, and acute coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure. Mini-BAL is planned for further evaluation.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's coronary history, ECG changes, and positive troponin suggest ACS, possibly a STEMI. Cardiology follow-up is recommended, and he should continue home aspirin and Plavix. Heparin gtt and integrillin gtt should be continued until further evaluation by cardiology.
3. Acute-on-Chronic Diastolic and Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction has decreased from 30% to 15%, indicating significant heart failure. Cardiology consult is appreciated, and restart of beta-blockade once"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced HIV/AIDS presenting transferred from OSH
   with respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with infection and acute coronary
   syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a long-standing
   history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in our record.
   His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers prior to
   presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **]
   remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Start Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and start Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin (changing levofloxacin to azithromycin as patient was on
   levofloacin as an outpatient)
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis in blood pressure stable
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # NSTEMI: His coronary history in the setting of ECG changes and a
   positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  The value of his cardiac
   enzymes are unlikely to represent demand ischemia in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt started at OSH
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Most likely due to acute pulmonary process.
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Chronic anemia likely related to his
   advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).  Baseline
   mid-30s.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.2, recently 1.5 in
   [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Consider neurosurgical evaluation for compression fracture
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   TTE [**2123-12-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %)
   with global hypokinesis and regioanl akinesis of the mid to distal
   anterior wall, septum, apex and the entire inferior wall. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-1-5**], the
   anterior, septal and apical akinesis is new (mid to distal LAD
   stenosis?).
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging.  Question superimposed
   infection
 CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but
   will treat for infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much
   evidence of congestive heart failure contributing per CT from
   yesterday.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
 will discontinue azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Likely done
 question mid-LAD stenosis.
   Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time, but
   when improved
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Heparin gtt, integrillin gtt discontinued [**12-29**]
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol today
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 15-20% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol today
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.  CT shows bilateral
   consolidations, likely atelectasis, but will treat for infection given
   immunocompromised status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
 will discontinue azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures

   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  No RP bleed on CT
   yesterday.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow
   suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Recheck hematocrit in afternoon and transfuse < 28
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].

   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the ICU from OSH with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and severe COPD. The CT scan shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but no evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 1,291 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 6, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a SpO2 of 98%. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188.

He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and zosyn, for a suspected superimposed infection. Mini-BAL has been performed to identify the causative organism. 

Cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in the ACS. However, the TTE shows an EF of 20-25%, suggesting severe depressed left ventricular systolic function with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, septum, apex, and entire inferior wall. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and moderate mitral regurgitation.

   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-1-5**], the
   anterior, septal and apical akinesis is new (mid to distal LAD
   stenosis?).
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging.  Question superimposed
   infection
 CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but
   will treat for infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much
   evidence of congestive heart failure contributing per CT from
   yesterday.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
 will discontinue azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time, but
   when improved
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Heparin gtt, integrillin gtt discontinued [**12-29**]
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol today
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol today
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 afebrile since.  Due to
   infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection, most likely
   etiology would be pulmonary.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but will treat for infection given immunocompromised
   status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
 will discontinue azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  No RP bleed on CT
   yesterday.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow
   suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Recheck hematocrit in afternoon and transfuse < 28
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital with acute coronary syndrome. The patient has severe COPD and a possible superimposed infection based on imaging. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating a completed infarct with a question of mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. His ejection fraction (EF) is severely depressed at 20-25% with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, septum, apex, and entire inferior wall. He has no ventricular septal defect, but there is moderate mitral regurgitation. His blood pressure is relatively stable, but he has had episodes of hypotension in the past. He also has an acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, as evidenced by his EF and echocardiogram findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and possible superimposed infection put him at risk for further respiratory failure. The ongoing treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and mini-balloon aspiration to obtain cultures.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute
   coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a
   long-standing history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in
   our record.  His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers
   prior to presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **] remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even to -500 cc
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: His coronary history in the setting of ECG
   changes and a positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  Q waves on EKG
   indicate STEMI.  The value of his cardiac enzymes are unlikely to
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.  Cardiac
   enzymes starting to trend down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt for now until further
   evaluation by cardiology
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade once blood pressure allows
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin for now pending cultures
   plan to discontinue at 48 hours if cultures negative
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   - Consider CT chest if stable
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline mid-30s
 hematocrit drop from 30
   to 26 overnight without obvious source of bleeding.  Patient on heparin
   gtt and integrillin gtt.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced
   HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Transfused 1U PRBC overnight
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Consider CT abdomen to rule out RP bleed if no appropriate bump after
   transfusion
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improved.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute
   coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a
   long-standing history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in
   our record.  His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers
   prior to presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **] remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even to -500 cc
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   - Chest CT does not show significant consolidation except for small
   area in LLL
   # Acute coronary syndrome: His coronary history in the setting of ECG
   changes and a positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  Q waves on EKG
   indicate STEMI.  The value of his cardiac enzymes are unlikely to
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.  Cardiac
   enzymes starting to trend down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt for now until further
   evaluation by cardiology
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade once blood pressure allows
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin for now pending cultures
   plan to discontinue at 48 hours if cultures negative
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   - Consider CT chest if stable
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline mid-30s
 hematocrit drop from 30
   to 26 overnight without obvious source of bleeding.  Patient on heparin
   gtt and integrillin gtt.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced
   HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Transfused 1U PRBC overnight
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Consider CT abdomen to rule out RP bleed if no appropriate bump after
   transfusion
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improved.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of tobacco abuse. He was transferred to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and congestive heart failure. His condition has been complex, involving multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, primarily due to bronchospasm/obstruction, with probable infection and acute coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing. He has a history of likely COPD but no pulmonary function tests (PFTs) on record. The chest X-ray is unrevealing, and he had fevers prior to presentation. Bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and Legionella remain on the differential. A CT chest is planned for further evaluation.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's coronary history, ECG changes, and positive troponin are concerning for ACS. Q waves on EKG indicate a STEMI. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting improvement. The patient will be followed by cardiology, and heparin and integrilin infusions will continue for now.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic CHF, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% from previous 30%."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with bronchspasm/obstruction as
   primary pathology at this time with probable infection and acute
   coronary syndrome/congestive heart failure contributing.  He has a
   long-standing history of tobacco abuse and likely COPD but no PFTs in
   our record.  His chest x-ray is unrevealing, however, he had fevers
   prior to presentation and bacterial pathogens, viral/influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Doctor First Name **] remain on the differential; he will need a CT chest for further
   evaluation when stable.  Of note, he was admitted to the MICU one year
   ago for pneumonia with Bordetella bronchisepticum.  He is maintained on
   Bactrim once a day for PCP prophylaxis and azithromycin once a week for
   [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an outpatient.  He has acute systolic congestive
   heart failure and apparent decrease in EF from 30% to 15% on OSH TTE.
   - Continue Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H and Combivent Q4H for COPD
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
   - Goal I/O even to -500 cc
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   - Chest CT does not show significant consolidation except for small
   area in LLL
   # Acute coronary syndrome: His coronary history in the setting of ECG
   changes and a positive troponin are concerning for ACS.  Q waves on EKG
   indicate STEMI.  The value of his cardiac enzymes are unlikely to
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.  Cardiac
   enzymes starting to trend down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Continue home aspirin, plavix
   - Continue heparin gtt, integrillin gtt for now until further
   evaluation by cardiology
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   - Restart beta-blockade to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements once
   blood pressure allows
   - Trend cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30
   - TTE in the morning
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Per
   cardiology, his OSH TTE shows EF 15% from previous 30%.  He was given
   lasix at the OSH without mention of fluid balance.
   - Cardiology consult; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now; consider diuresis if blood pressure stable
   - Restart beta-blockade once blood pressure allows
   - Start ACEI once blood pressure allows
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 apparently afebrile at
   OSH.  Due to infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection,
   most likely etiology would be pulmonary.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin for now pending cultures
   plan to discontinue at 48 hours if cultures negative
   - Mini-BAL for above
   - Urinalysis, culture
   - Blood cultures
   - Stool cultures if diarrhea
   - Consider CT chest if stable
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline mid-30s
 hematocrit drop from 30
   to 26 overnight without obvious source of bleeding.  Patient on heparin
   gtt and integrillin gtt.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced
   HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Transfused 1U PRBC overnight
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 30 given acute coronary syndrome
   - Consider CT abdomen to rule out RP bleed if no appropriate bump after
   transfusion
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improved.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to poor forward flow.
   - Urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Needs CT to further evaluate compression fracture and consider
   neurosurgical evaluation
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with HIV and a low CD4 count who was admitted with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He now has an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) secondary to respiratory failure. The patient has completed ACS treatment and is past the window for salvage catheterization. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 742 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 26. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 188, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 8 L/min. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 109/74 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure - Looking more like AECOPD. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (admittedly,
   only one sample). Still diffusely wheezy. Add inhaled steroid today.
   Cont. Vanc/Zosyn x 8 days. Diruese -500 ti 1L today.
   ACS - Completed infarct. On ASA/PLAVIX. Low dose BB probably okay (even
   in setting of COPD). Aim to add ACE as tolerated.
   Anemia - s/p 2 U PRBC. Trend Hct. heparin + integrilin now off.
   HIV - Home HAART + prophylaxis.
   further plans as per resident note.

   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging
 less wheezy on
   examination today.  Question superimposed infection
 CT shows
   bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but will treat for
   infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much evidence of
   congestive heart failure contributing per CT from yesterday.
   - Change Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 60 mg PO daily
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Continue metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 afebrile since.  Due to
   infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection, most likely
   etiology would be pulmonary.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but will treat for infection given immunocompromised
   status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  No RP bleed on CT
   yesterday.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow
   suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Recheck hematocrit in afternoon and transfuse < 28
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute coronary syndrome. He was transferred from another hospital with respiratory failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bilateral consolidations on imaging. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, CD4 count of 28, viral load of 65, NNRTI resistance, and is currently on HAART regimen. He also has a recent T8 compression fracture and peripheral neuropathy. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate, but he is agitated and requires sedation. His oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and bilateral consolidations may lead to further respiratory compromise, requiring close monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

2. Infection: The presence of fever prior to presentation and bilateral consolidations on CT suggests a possible superimposed infection, which needs to be treated considering the patient's immunocompromised status.

3. Acute Coronary Syndrome: Although cardiac enzymes are trending down, there is a question of mid-LAD stenosis. Close monitoring and appropriate antiplatelet therapy should be continued.

4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF 20-25%), indicating diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department. He presents with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and possible superimposed infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 50% FiO2 and 14 cmH2O PEEP. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 115/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's recent lab results show mild leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for superimposed infection given his immunocompromised status, which may worsen his respiratory status.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has completed an infarct with question mid-LAD stenosis. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating some improvement. However, he still requires cardiac monitoring and may need further intervention once his respiratory status improves.
3. Infection: The patient's fever prior to presentation suggests the possibility of an underlying infection. The CT scan shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, which may indicate pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and a mini-BAL has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with PMH history as above now with persistent
   respiratory failure [**2-20**] AECOPD. Plan as per resident note. Briefly, s/p
   ACS with no hit to EF (currently ~20%) on ASA/BB/ACE/Plavix. He does
   not tolerate statis due to interaction with his HAART. From a
   respiratory standpoint he is less wheezy today. Based on the pressure
   waveforms on his vent (matching machine rate and pt. triggering rate)
   his auto-peep appears to be well compensated for at set PEEP of 14. we
   can switch his IV steroids to po prednisone 60, continue MDI's. He is
   slightly over-ventilated on his ABG so will minimize inspiratory
   pressures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, low CD4 on HAART, presumed COPD, and CAD status post stent. He presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion and was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has completed an infarct with a new ejection fraction of 20% and persistent respiratory failure. He is currently on beclamethasone inhaled, mechanical ventilation, and various medications including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic heparin.

24-hour events include the initiation of beclamethasone and stable vent settings. The patient has allergies to amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and paradoxical eff. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on [2123-12-29] at 08:00 PM, acyclovir on [2123-12-30] at 12:00 AM, piperacillin on [2123-12-31] at 06:00 AM, and vancomycin on [2123-12-31] at 08:00 AM.

Infusions include fentanyl at 250 mcg/hour, and other ICU medications such as methadone hydrochloride and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's flow sheet data as of [2123-12-31] 11:10 AM shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/71 to 119/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure is 15.6 mmHg, with total intake of 2,322 mL and output of 3,325 mL. The patient's urine output is 3,325 mL. 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 738 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 59 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 186, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 35.1 mL/min.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of HIV, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cough, shortness of breath, respiratory failure, and acute coronary syndrome. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a completed infarct, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, and persistent respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

The patient has been receiving various treatments including beclamethasone inhaled, ventilator settings stable, and different antibiotics. He is also on multiple medications such as fentanyl infusion, methadone hydrochloride, and heparin sodium prophylaxis.

His vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/71 mmHg to 119/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals distant breath sounds with no wheezing, active exhalation with tight abdomen, and an erythematous diffuse rash that has improved since arrival.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are abnormalities in other lab parameters including elevated creatinine, troponin-T,"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging
 less wheezy on
   examination today.  Question superimposed infection
 CT shows
   bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but will treat for
   infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much evidence of
   congestive heart failure contributing per CT from yesterday.
   - Change Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 60 mg PO daily
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Continue metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 afebrile since.  Due to
   infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection, most likely
   etiology would be pulmonary.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but will treat for infection given immunocompromised
   status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture

   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  No RP bleed on CT
   yesterday.  Chronic anemia likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow
   suppression and/or medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Recheck hematocrit in afternoon and transfuse < 28
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # Hypotension: Resolved.  Patient was on levophed on transfer but now
   off.
   - Monitor
   # Elevated AST: Etiology unclear; may be medication effect versus due
   to infection.  Other liver enzymes within normal limits.
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   - OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**2117**]
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and respiratory failure. He was transferred from the operating room (OSH) with severe respiratory failure due to acute coronary syndrome. The patient has a history of COPD, for which he is receiving combivent every 4 hours and albuterol as needed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to suspected superimposed infection, and a mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been performed to identify the causative organism.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in his acute coronary syndrome. However, there is a question of mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis, and the patient is being followed by cardiology. Medications such as aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and lisinopril have been added to his regimen.

The patient also has evidence of acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Cardiology is following up with the patient, and medications including metoprolol and lisinopril have been initiated.

Other assessments include fevers, which were present prior to presentation but have since resolved. The cause of the fever is uncertain, but it could be due to infection or acute coronary"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute coronary syndrome. He was transferred to the ICU with respiratory failure and severe COPD, as evidenced by imaging. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is agitated and moving all extremities.

The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, anemia, renal failure, and HIV/AIDS. He also has peripheral neuropathy and a recent compression fracture of the T8 vertebra.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, steroids, antivirals, antifungals, and medications for his various conditions. He is also receiving pain management with methadone.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. His creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. His liver enzymes are also abnormal, with an elevated AST level.

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral consolidations and atelectasis, which could be indicative of pneumonia. A mini-brain lung auscult"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of HIV, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease who presented with cough and shortness of breath. He was transferred to the hospital with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. He is now in the ICU with a completed infarct, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%, and persistent respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and his vital signs include a fever of 101.6°F, blood cultures have been sent twice, and he is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antiplatelet agents. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. A portable chest X-ray reveals an endotracheal tube positioned high above the carina, with left IJ crossing midline and hazy opacity in the right base.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility due to being in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to PE. Prophyl"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of AIDS, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and CAD who presented with cough and dyspnea. He was transferred to the hospital with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is currently in the MICU with completed infarct, new ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and persistent respiratory failure. He has been experiencing fever, and blood cultures have been sent. The patient has allergies to amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and diazepam. He has received various antibiotics and antiviral medications. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with forced exhalation showing faint inspiratory wheeze on the left anteriorly and prolonged expiratory phase. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. His chest X-ray reveals an endotracheal tube that is high above the carina, with worsening hazy opacity in the right lower lobe, and no new infiltrates.

   48 year old man with PMH history as above now with persistent
   respiratory failure [**2-20**] AECOPD. Plan as per resident note. Briefly, s/p
   ACS with new hit to EF (currently ~20%) on ASA/BB/ACE/Plavix. He does
   not tolerate statins due to interaction with his HAART. From a
   respiratory standpoint he is less wheezy today. Based on the pressure
   waveforms on his vent (matching machine rate and pt. triggering rate)
   his auto-peep appears to be well compensated for set PEEP of 14. Will
   switch his IV steroids to po prednisone 60, continue MDI's. He is
   slightly over-ventilated on his ABG so will minimize inspiratory
   pressures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of HIV, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post stent placement. He presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He has completed an infarct with a new ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing persistent respiratory failure, which is a concerning condition that requires close monitoring and management.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with PMH history as above now with persistent
   respiratory failure [**2-20**] AECOPD. Plan as per resident note. Briefly, s/p
   ACS with new hit to EF (currently ~20%) on ASA/BB/ACE/Plavix. He does
   not tolerate statins due to interaction with his HAART. From a
   respiratory standpoint he is less wheezy today. Based on the pressure
   waveforms on his vent (matching machine rate and pt. triggering rate)
   his auto-peep appears to be well compensated for set PEEP of 14. Will
   switch his IV steroids to po prednisone 60, continue MDI's. He is
   slightly over-ventilated on his ABG so will minimize inspiratory
   pressures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and HIV/AIDS. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure secondary to an exacerbation of COPD.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 118/76 to 108/70 mmHg, heart rate between 87 and 81 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, methadone hydrochloride, and others. He has been receiving various antibiotics since December 31st.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's respiratory support consists of being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume of 1,051 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and an ABG indicating mild hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has a history of allergies to amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and Valium. The patient has been on various antibiotics and antivirals since admission. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation management. Other medications include methadone, heparin sodium, and ICU care medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the dyspnea. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/76 mmHg to 108/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,431 mL and output of 2,135 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The set parameters include a tidal volume (Vt) of 1,051 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) divided by FiO2 is 216. ABG results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 63 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 108%, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 35 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -11 mEq/L, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L.

Physical examination reveals an endotracheal tube and OG tube in place, normal heart sounds, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologic status with no movement or assessed tone. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 133 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 10.9 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 122 mg/dL, decreased creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, elevated potassium (K+) at 146 mEq/L, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 778 IU/L, and other lab values within normal range.

Assessment and plan include anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute myocardial infarction. The patient is on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging
 less wheezy on
   examination today.  Question superimposed infection
 CT shows
   bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but will treat for
   infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much evidence of
   congestive heart failure contributing per CT from yesterday. Prolonged
   expiratory phase c/w COPD; continuing inhalers and steroids, would not
   increase yet; will see if we can dial down FiO2 and PEEP at all today
   - Change Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 60 mg PO daily
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Continue metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation
 afebrile since.  Due to
   infection versus acute coronary syndrome.  If infection, most likely
   etiology would be pulmonary.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but treating for infection given immunocompromised status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  Chronic anemia likely
   related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication
   effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse <30
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.  Baseline creatinine 1.2,
   recently 1.5 in [**Month (only) 1033**].
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and respiratory failure secondary to acute coronary syndrome. He presented with fever, bilateral consolidations on CT scan, and signs of respiratory distress. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. Mini-BAL was performed to identify the causative organism.

The patient's medical history includes severe COPD, for which he is receiving inhalers and steroids. He also has a history of peripheral neuropathy, presumed due to stavudine toxicity, and a recent T8 compression fracture.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, oxygen saturation of 95% on mechanical ventilation, and respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute. Physical examination reveals diminished peripheral pulses and warm, dry skin. Neurological examination shows normal tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 106 mg/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 9.1 mmol/L. Blood cultures are positive for yeast, and sputum culture shows budding yeast 1+. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent history of respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and an acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and renal failure. He is also on several medications for his conditions, including HAART for HIV/AIDS, antibiotics for suspected infection, and medications for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's fever and worsening infiltrates on CT scan suggest a possible pulmonary infection. Mini-BAL has been performed to identify the causative organism.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has completed an infarct with question mid-LAD stenosis. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement, but cardiac follow-up is planned.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic CHF. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Cardiology follow-up is scheduled.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect). Monitoring of blood counts and possible transfusion may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent history of respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. He is currently in the ICU for severe COPD and possible superimposed infection. The patient has a fever of 102.1°F and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his immunocompromised status. He has completed myocardial infarction with a question of mid-LAD stenosis. His ejection fraction is 20-25%. He also has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure. The patient has chronic anemia, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient is being treated for a possible pulmonary infection, which may worsen his respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and completed myocardial infarction. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, which may progress if not properly managed.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia that could potentially worsen if not addressed.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, so monitoring for DKA is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, anemia, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been experiencing fevers, with a current temperature of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for a suspected pulmonary infection, as well as treatment for his other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient's fever and bilateral consolidations on CT scan suggest a possible pulmonary infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not appropriately treated.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient has completed myocardial infarction and is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or recurrent ischemic events.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, which may worsen over time, leading to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely related to his advanced HIV infection or medication effects. This can contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and further compromise organ function.
5. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating chronic renal impairment. Acute kidney injury or further deterioration in renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of persistent respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), recent anterior myocardial infarction (AMI), and AIDS. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing respiratory failure, fever, and worsening right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius (102.1 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/63 to 123/78 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation, and respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Bactrim, Fluconazole, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Acyclovir. Additionally, the patient is on a sedation regimen consisting of methadone, fentanyl, and versed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation, gradual weaning of FiO2 targeting an oxygen saturation of 92%, decreasing PEEP slowly if tolerated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of AIDS, low CD4 count on HAART therapy, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease post stent placement. He presented to the hospital with cough and shortness of breath, was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome, and is now in the MICU with completed infarct, new ejection fraction (EF) around 20%, and persistent respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 80-90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP/PSV ventilator support with FiO2 at 40%. The patient is intubated and sedated, unarousable to voice, with faint inspiratory wheeze on the left anteriorly, prolonged expiratory phase, and no expiratory wheezes. The abdomen is soft, with no distention, and shows positive bowel sounds. The extremities are warm with mild edema.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Bactrim, Fluconazole, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Acyclovir. He is also on infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam, as well as other ICU medications such as Heparin Sodium and Methadone Hydrochloride"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease status post stent placement. He presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea and was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has completed a myocardial infarction, new ejection fraction of approximately 20%, and persistent respiratory failure. He is febrile and has a history of drug fevers during prior hospitalizations.

24-hour events include fever spikes and recollection of temperature. The patient's partner reports that the patient has had filling which fell out and had food getting stuck in it, but did not intervene. The patient has allergies to amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and diazepam.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin, fluconazole, acyclovir, and Bactrim), sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), anticoagulants (SC heparin), and other medications (HAART, insulin SS, Lopressor, lisinopril, albuterol inh q2hrs prn, Atrovent q4hrs, prednisone 60mg qd, beclomethasone inh qd, Peridex, ASA, and Plavix).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 1002 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.42, PaCO2 56 mmHg, PaO2 170 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) 38 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals an intubated, sedated, and unarousable patient with prolonged expiratory phase and crackles on the right lung. The patient's abdominal examination is soft with no distention or rebound, and extremities are warm with mild edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 124 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL, and glucose of 120 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal a portable chest X-ray showing an endotracheal tube (ETT) in place with borderline high markings, emerging right lower lobe (RLL) and right middle lobe (RML) infiltrate initially appearing atelectatic but now with clear infiltrate.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with persistent respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a recent anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient is febrile and has evolving R"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of AIDS, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post stent placement. He presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea and was subsequently transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient now has completed infarction with an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20% and persistent respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has been febrile on two occasions, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The presence of yeast in the sputum suggests a fungal infection, such as candidiasis. Appropriate antifungal therapy should be initiated based on the culture results.

3. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent ACS, there is a risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction. Close monitoring of cardiac function, including serial echocardiograms and cardiac enzymes, is crucial.

4. Prolonged Sedation: The patient is currently receiving sedatives (methadone, fentanyl, and versed) for int"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of AIDS, low CD4 count on HAART, presumed COPD, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post stent placement. He presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion, and was later transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient now has completed infarction, a new ejection fraction of approximately 20%, and persistent respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This may require continuous monitoring and management of oxygen delivery and ventilation parameters.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has experienced ACS, which involves reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever and various cultures have been obtained (blood, urine, and sputum). This suggests a potential infection that needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of fluids but less output, indicating possible fluid overload. This should be carefully managed to avoid complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
5. Medication Interactions: The patient is on a complex HAART"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease, and a history of acute coronary syndrome. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been experiencing fevers, which his partner attributes to medications and a recent dental filling. The patient's condition has been complicated by severe COPD, suspected superimposed infection, and acute coronary syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's fever, bilateral consolidations on CT scan, and the decision to treat for infection indicate a potential pulmonary infection.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of ACS and is showing signs of ongoing cardiac issues, including a completed infarct and mid-LAD stenosis. This increases the risk of further cardiac events.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's imaging shows evidence of severe COPD but not much evidence of congestive heart failure contributing. However, there is a concern for acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic CHF, especially given the low ejection fraction (EF 20-25%).
4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure at baseline and will require careful monitoring and management of fluid balance and medication dosing.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute-on-chronic anemia and may require transfusion support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease, and a history of dental issues. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and suspected pulmonary infection. The patient's medical history includes COPD, chronic anemia, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia. He has been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS with a low CD4 count and resistant viral load. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, bilateral consolidations on CT scan, and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest a possible pulmonary infection.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's history of CAD and acute coronary syndrome may lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the use of statins may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Opportunistic infections: Due to the patient's advanced AIDS status, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculosis, and fungal infections.
6. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's compromised cardiac function and the presence of congestive heart failure increase the risk of cardiovascular collapse.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with HIV, low CD4 on HAART, CAD, s/p ACS , HF with EF
   now 20% and apparent  acute exac COPD. Less bronchospasm on exam today,
   will start to wean steroids. He is having more difficulty with
   oxygenation today. Increased secretions, new fever and possible
   infiltrate on CXR so suspect new VAP. Cultures pending from
   bronchoscopy, will f/u. He is on
   vanc + zosyn. Will add cipro today. Newly hypotensive - will try to
   decrease PEEP as well as check Cv02 and pulse pressure variation today.
   Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with HIV, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. He has a history of acute exacerbation of COPD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His current condition includes severe bronchospasm, tracheobronchomalacia, and decreased ejection fraction (EF) at 20%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set with a tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 101/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient is sedated and on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, methadone hydrochloride, and others. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.0 g/dL, sodium (Na+) of 140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.6 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl-) of 105 mEq/L. The patient's chest X-ray shows a possible new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) infiltrate. The patient's condition is described as critically ill, with ongoing efforts to wean off steroids and manage his respiratory support. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of further infections such as VAP, cardiovascular instability, and potential need for additional interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with HIV, low CD4 on HAART, CAD, s/p ACS , HF with EF
   now 20% and apparent AECOPD. Less bronchospasm on exam today, will
   start to wean steroids. He
   is having more difficulty with oxygenation today. Increased
   secretions,  new fever and possible infiltrate on CXR so suspect new
   VAP. Culutres pending from bronchoscopy, will f/u. He is on
   vanc + zosyn. Will add cipro today. Newly hypotensive - will try to
   decrease PEEP as well as check Cv02 and pulse pressure variation today.
   Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of HIV, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with acute respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required multiple interventions to manage his condition. He is currently showing signs of worsening oxygenation, increased secretions, new fever, and a possible infiltrate on the chest X-ray, which suggests a new case of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures are pending from bronchoscopy, and he will be treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, and efforts will be made to decrease PEEP and check CVO2 and pulse pressure variation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of increased secretions, new fever, and possible infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest a new case of VAP. This is a common complication in patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently below normal, indicating hypotension. This can be a result of sepsis secondary to the suspected VAP or cardiac dysfunction due to his pre-existing CAD and decreased ejection fraction.
3. Tracheomalacia: The patient's bronchos"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   consistent with this diagnosis.  Converted solumedrol to prednisone
   [**1-1**].  Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia now
   with new infiltrate, increased secretions
 s/p BAL [**1-2**].  Not much
   evidence of congestive heart failure contributing per CT.
   - Continue prednisone
 decrease to 40 mg today
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Wean PEEP as possible
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn -> add
   ciprofloxacin today
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation, now with fevers again.
   Initially attributed to acute coronary syndrome, now concerned for
   VAP.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but
   treating for infection given immunocompromised status.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn -> add
   ciprofloxacin today
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Mini-BAL on admission for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella
   culture; Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear;
   CMV culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   - Continue to CIS >100.5
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Continue metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  Chronic anemia likely
   related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication
   effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse <30
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: at baseline
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. He has severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics consistent with respiratory failure. A new infiltrate on chest imaging suggests possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have been sent. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in acute coronary syndrome. He also has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. The patient has chronic anemia, likely related to his advanced HIV, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. His HIV/AIDS status is noted with a CD4 count of 28 and viral load of 65. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications. The patient also has peripheral neuropathy and a recent T8 compression fracture. His hyperlipidemia is being managed, and he is receiving ICU care, including tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a new infiltrate on chest imaging, suggesting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, and a history of respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and chronic conditions such as COPD, congestive heart failure, anemia, renal failure, and peripheral neuropathy. He is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. He has bilateral consolidations on CT scan, likely atelectasis, but is being treated for infection due to his immunocompromised status. He has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antiretrovirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient has symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary infection, including fever, tachypnea, and bilateral consolidations on CT scan. This could potentially lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has a history of acute coronary syndrome, and there is ongoing concern for cardiac complications. This could result in further myocardial ischemia or infarction.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen due to his current condition, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially leading to acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation, now spiking again.
   Patient
s partner reports history of fever in response to medications
   and recent dental filling lost. . Initially attributed to acute
   coronary syndrome, now concerned for pulmonary infection. CT shows
   bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but treating for
   infection given immunocompromised status.
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days , also on fluconazole
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture

   - Continue to CIS >100.5
   - Consider BRONCHOSCOPY today to eval worsening infiltrate on CXR.
   - Advance ET tube 1 cm
   - Zosyn is [**Hospital1 **] am and pm, but given concern for infection cannot stop
   at this time. Need to consider as possible source for fevers.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging.  Question superimposed
   infection
 CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but
   will treat for infection given immunocompromised status.  Not much
   evidence of congestive heart failure contributing per CT. Prolonged
   expiratory phase c/w COPD; continuing inhalers and steroids. Converted
   solumedrol to prednisone [**1-1**].
   - PEEP and FiO2  -- wean FiO2
   - Continue combivent Q4H for COPD with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn x 8
   days
   - Mini-BAL for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;

   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 question mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol

   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Continue metoprolol
 add on lisinopril today
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  Chronic anemia likely
   related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication
   effect).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, and acute coronary syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, severe COPD, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics consistent with this diagnosis. He is being treated with prednisone, combivent, beclomethasone, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The goal is to wean PEEP as possible and continue aggressive I/O management.
2. Fevers: The patient has fevers again, likely due to VAP. A CT scan shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but the patient is being treated for infection given his immunocompromised status. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and a mini-BAL is planned for various cultures.
3. Relative Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is believed to be secondary to sedation and high PEEP. PEEP is being weaned, and antibiotics are being continued. Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now.
4. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient completed an infarct likely in the mid-LAD. Cardiac enzymes are trending down. Cardiology is following the case, and no intervention is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent transfer from an outside hospital (OSH) due to respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been unable to wean from the ventilator, and there are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever has resolved, but he still has relative hypotension likely secondary to sedation and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's cardiac enzymes have trended down, indicating completed infarction, and he is likely to have mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20-25%, down from prior 30%. The patient also has chronic anemia, likely related to his advanced HIV, and acute-on-chronic renal failure at baseline. His CD4 count is 28 with a viral load of 65, and he is on an integrase inhibitor as part of his highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patient has peripheral neuropathy presumed due to stavudine toxicity and a recent T8 compression fracture. He also has hyperlipidemia but is currently on hold for further management.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   consistent with this diagnosis.  Converted solumedrol to prednisone
   [**1-1**].  Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia now
   with new infiltrate, increased secretions
 s/p BAL [**1-2**].  Not much
   evidence of congestive heart failure contributing per CT.
   - Continue prednisone
 decrease to 40 mg today
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Wean PEEP as possible
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn -> add
   ciprofloxacin today, increase dosing of zosyn from Q8H to Q6H
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed
   # Fevers: Fever to 102 prior to presentation, now with fevers again.
   Initially attributed to acute coronary syndrome, now concerned for
   VAP.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but
   treating for infection given immunocompromised status.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn -> add
   ciprofloxacin today, increase dosing of zosyn from Q8H to Q6H
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Mini-BAL on admission for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella
   culture; Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear;
   CMV culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all NGTD
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   - Continue to CIS >100.5
   # Relative hypotension: Believed secondary to sedation and high PEEP.
   Also new pneumonia as above.  CvO2 91% and no respiratory variation to
   suggest hypovolemia contributing.
   - Wean PEEP
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Hold metoprolol, lisinopril for now
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Hold metoprolol, lisinopril for now given relative hypotension
   (restart [**Name (NI) 3253**] as captopril when able)
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: TTE
   yesterday shows EF 20-25% from 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O even for now
   - Hold metoprolol, lisinopril for now (restart [**Name (NI) 3253**] as captopril when
   able)
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Status post 3U PRBC.  BRBPR in setting of
   heparin gtt and integrillin gtt, none since.  Chronic anemia likely
   related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication
   effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: At baseline.
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

Other medical conditions include acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently sedated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed new infiltrates on imaging, increased secretions, and persistent fevers, suggesting the possibility of VAP.
2. Acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction has decreased from 30% to 20-25%, indicating worsening heart function.
3. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient had a completed myocardial infarction likely involving the mid-left anterior descending artery.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute-on-chronic anemia, likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or medication effect).
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure at baseline.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, but the fibrate medication is currently held.
7. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient has peripheral neuropathy presumed due to stavudine toxicity.
8. HIV/AIDS: The patient has advanced HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 28 and a viral load of 65, indicating severe immunosuppression."

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of HIV, low CD4 on HAART, presenting with acute respiratory failure, acute chest syndrome, and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 109/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. He has symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds, but with a prolonged expiratory phase. His extremities are edematous, and his neurologic examination shows minimal responsiveness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but his lactic acid level is elevated at 0.8 mmol/L. The rest of his laboratory values are either normal or not provided.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected VAP, sedatives for mechanical ventilation, and medications for his underlying conditions such as HIV and ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The patient's plan includes discontinuation of sedation, possible extubation later in the day, and continued treatment for VAP. He may also benefit from an interventional pulmonology consult due to tracheobronchomalacia noted on bronchoscopy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, low CD4 count on HAART, presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD), and likely Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, but he has pinpoint pupils, distant heart sounds, clear breath sounds with a prolonged expiratory phase, and his extremities show some edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels. Microbiology BAL is negative. The patient's sedation will be discontinued today, with hopes for extubation later today. He will continue receiving Vanc/Zosyn for VAP and prednisone taper with MDI's and inhaled steroids. Further plans are noted in the resident's progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's presentation suggests possible VAP, indicated by the presence of AECOPD and recent intubation. The continued use of antibiotics is appropriate to treat and prevent this complication.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Monitoring and adjusting the ventilator settings are"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   consistent with this diagnosis.  Converted solumedrol to prednisone
   [**1-1**].  Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia after
   developed infiltrate, increased secretions
 s/p BAL [**1-2**].  Do not
   feel congestive heart failure contributing per CT.
   - Diuresis negative 1-2 liters
   - Continue prednisone; tapering down
 3 days 40 mg, then to 20 x3
   days, 10 x3 days
 start 20mg [**1-5**]
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - PEEP weaned, weaning sedation to attempt extubation
   - Treated for 10 day course with broad spectum antibiotic :vancomycin,
   zosyn, ciprofloxacin
 now all stopped
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all negative
   or NGTD
   - Goal I/O even
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) for agitation on ventilator to decrease requirements of
   fentanyl/versed; consider reducing to reduce sedation
   # Fevers: Afebrile. Fever to 102 prior to presentation, earlier
   fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary syndrome, then VAP.  CT
   shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but treating for
   infection given immunocompromised status.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, cipro
   - BAL  and prior mini-BAL all unrevealing
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Relative hypotension: Believed secondary to sedation and high PEEP.
   Weaning PEEP has improved this.
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   -  Restart metoprolol, captopril
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O still even for now
   - Restart metoprolol, captopril
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since.  Holding steady currently. Chronic anemia
   likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or
   medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: At baseline.
   - Goal even today
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H (higher than home equivalent of pain
   medication) to decrease requirements of fentanyl/versed; may consider
   reducing this if oversedated
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   # Fevers: Afebrile. Fever to 102 prior to presentation, earlier
   fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary syndrome, then VAP.  CT
   shows bilateral consolidations, likely atelectasis, but treating for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was transferred from OSH with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with severe COPD, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, acute-on-chronic anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/74 mmHg to 125/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is sedated and intubated on a ventilator, receiving CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 633 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

His physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, symmetric breath sounds with crackles, and no cyanosis. His laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Renal function tests are within normal limits, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. Imaging studies reveal emphysematous changes on chest X-ray, consistent"

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of respiratory failure. He was transferred from the emergency department (ED) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and severe COPD. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 71 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 119/74 to 125/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and has pinpoint pupils.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 140, elevated creatinine levels at 1.0, and slightly low hemoglobin levels at 10.9 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Radiology images show bilateral consolidations likely due to atelectasis. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were negative.

   48 year old man with history as above. No frank bronchospasm and
   weaning steroids. Did not tolerate mild decrease in PEEP today whihc is
   concerning for
   LV overload. Also treating empiricaly for possible VAP but CXR is
   without widespread infiltrate. RISBI < 105 this am so would favor
   agressive diuresis and move towards extubation.
   TBB -1 to 2 L. Continue to avoid sedation. Has completed > 8 days of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of HIV and low CD4 count on HAART, presenting with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation support. The patient has been weaned off sedation and is now alert. He has been extubated and is breathing spontaneously with minimal ventilator support. However, his mental status is slow to recover from sedation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/76 mmHg to 133/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,790 mL and output of 2,080 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 290 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. His FiO2 is set at 40% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 380, and Ve of 5.8 L/min.

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases, no dramatic wheezes"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 48-year-old man with HIV and low CD4 count on HAART, who presented with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on minimal vent support and is off sedation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/76 mmHg to 133/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's mental status is slow to recover from sedation. 

On physical examination, the patient has diminished breath sounds at the bases, no dramatic wheezes, distant heart sounds, and extremities with 1+ edema. Neurologically, the patient is alert and follows simple commands. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.2 K/uL, slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 10.9 g/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 2.12. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging shows fluid in the fissure on the right and haziness of the pulmonary vasculature.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe COPD. There is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on the development of an infiltrate, increased secretions, and positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture for common pathogens. The patient has completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics and is now off all antibiotics.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe COPD, which has led to the need for mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are maintained at around 95% with an FiO2 of 50%.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed an infiltrate on chest X-ray, increased secretions, and positive BAL culture, raising suspicion for VAP. Despite completing a 10-day course of antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for further infection.

3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient presented with ACS, and cardiac enzymes have trended down. The patient is being managed with antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel), beta-blockers (metoprolol), ACE inhibitors (captopril), and statins. Stress testing will be done once the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They were unable to be extubated due to derecruitment and desaturation, requiring recruitment maneuvers and an increase in PEEP to stabilize. The patient continues to desaturate in the mid-80s, and FiO2 has been increased to 50%. The patient has diuresed a negative 1.8 liters and another 600 mL since midnight. Antibiotics have been stopped as they completed a 10-day course. Prednisone was weaned down to 20 mg. The patient has allergies to Amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and diazepam. They received propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and methadone hydrochloride. Heparin sodium was started for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 102/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated, follows simple commands, and responds to tactile stimuli. There are no acute distress or pain reported. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The use of high P"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with PMH as above presents with respiratory failure [**2-20**]
   ACS and AECOPD. S/P diuresis yesterday and now tolerating decreased
   PEEP.
   Check RSBI and SBT today with aim to extubate. Propofol is now off.
   Tolerating CAD regimen of ASA/BB/ACE. No statin [**2-20**] interaction with
   HAART. Additional 40mg IV lasix now for TBB -500 to 1L. Further plans
   as per resident note.
   Update:
   Bronchoscopy done for high volume secretions, which was unremarkable
   purulent sputum in lower airways at all. Mucosa erythematous, inflamed
   but not edematous and no endobronchial lesions.
   Failed decrease in FiO2 from .5
 0.4. O2sat dropped from 95
 88%. PEEP
   was increased back to 10.
   High A-a gradient with P/F ratio 166. No significant infiltrate on CXR,
   and actually appears less volume overloaded, corresponding with his
   effective diuresis. He has multifactorial resp failure with clinically
   severe COPD, severe bronchomalacia, recent VAP, but those are not
   really enough to explain his high oxygen requirement. CT to r/o
   interstitial process. Will also obtain CT-A to r/o PE as we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t have
   a great explanation for his gas exchange defect.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of HIV, low CD4 on HAART, coronary artery disease (CAD) with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and presenting with acute respiratory failure due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). The patient remains intubated and likely has elements of volume overload.

Key findings from the note include:
1. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) within normal range, blood pressure (BP) on the lower side, respiratory rate (RR) within normal range, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%, and temperature within normal range.
2. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion, and prolonged expiration but overall synchronized breathing with the ventilator, indicating improved respiratory function.
3. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium (K+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-). Liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, while kidney function tests show mildly elevated creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
4. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease, and acute coronary syndrome who was transferred to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has severe COPD and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been intubated for 11 days and has developed an infiltrate consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but his blood cultures are negative. The patient also has a fever, relative hypotension, acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure with a decreased ejection fraction, chronic anemia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 28 and viral load of 65. He is on antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and prophylactic medications. The patient also has peripheral neuropathy and a compression fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed an infiltrate consistent with VAP, which is a common complication in patients who have been intubated for an extended period.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome, which increases the risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.

   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   consistent with this diagnosis.  Converted solumedrol to prednisone
   [**1-1**] and on prednisone wean.  Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator
   associated pneumonia after developed infiltrate, increased secretions
   s/p BAL [**1-2**], completed course vanc/cipro/zosyn.  Diuresed [**2034-1-2**]
   given evidence of increased volume by CXR and secretions, but did not
   improve oxygenation. No extubatable due to high A-a gradient.
   - F/U CT chest to eval A-a gradient re: ? PE and [**Month/Day/Year 1277**] infiltrate likely
   due to BAL, but given GPC on gram stain from BAL will continue
   VANCOMYCIN
   - Day 11 of Intubation

   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all negative
   or NGTD
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q12H
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, one fever to 101 likely in setting of
   BAL. Also started VANC for GPCs on BAL.. Fever to 102 prior to
   presentation, earlier fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary
   syndrome, then VAP.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but treating for infection given immunocompromised status.
   - New BAL with GPCs, On VANC, pending speciation
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures

   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Relative hypotension: Believed secondary to sedation and high PEEP.
   PEEP from 18 to 10. On lowest sedation possible. Tolerating his needed
   cardiac meds.
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, captopril
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate
   - Goal I/O
 even to neg 500 ml
   - On metoprolol, captopril
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since.  Holding steady currently. Chronic anemia
   likely related to his advanced HIV (marrow suppression and/or
   medication effect).
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: At baseline.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV 12HR
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced AIDS, CAD, and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended time, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The presence of infiltrate on the chest X-ray and increased secretions suggests this possibility.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has completed an infarct likely due to mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis. Although cardiac enzymes are trending down, there may be ongoing cardiac issues requiring close monitoring.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic CHF with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. This could be a result of the patient's advanced HIV infection leading to cardiomyopathy.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely related to advanced HIV infection, which may be exacerbated by medication effects or marrow suppression.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure at baseline. Renal dose medications should be adjusted accordingly, and renal function should be closely monitored.

6. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient has peripheral neuropathy presumed due to stavudine toxicity. Meth"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with HIV and low CD4 on HAART, presenting with respiratory failure due to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He also has a history of STEMI with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's left lower lobe infiltrate and ground glass appearance on chest CT, along with fever, may suggest VAP. He is being treated with vancomycin for possible gram-positive cocci infection seen on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture. However, the transient fever could also be attributable to the BAL procedure itself.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The non-occlusive PE in the right lower lobe (RLL) detected on chest CT could contribute to the patient's respiratory failure. Even a small PE can cause significant endothelial dysfunction and V/Q mismatch, especially considering the patient's severely damaged lung parenchyma.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent A-a gradient and requirement for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) indicate the possibility of ARDS. Further assessment and management are needed.
4. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs show a fever, and there is evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with HIV, low CD4 on HAART, presenting with respiratory failure and a history of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and acute respiratory syndrome (ACS). He is currently in the ICU and has persistent A-a gradient and requires positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

24-hour events include bronchoscopy, which showed clear lungs but sputum culture was sent. A chest CT revealed left lower lobe pneumonia and possible non-occlusive pulmonary embolism (PE) in the right lower lobe (RLL). The patient received various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, vancomycin, and acyclovir.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/60 mmHg to 155/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient has an elevated lactate level and elevated levels of cardiac enzymes.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with respiratory failure due to AECOPD and"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   consistent with this diagnosis.  Converted solumedrol to prednisone
   [**1-1**] and on prednisone wean.  Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator
   associated pneumonia after developed infiltrate, increased secretions
   s/p BAL [**1-2**], completed course vanc/cipro/zosyn.  Diuresed [**2034-1-2**]
   given evidence of increased volume by CXR and secretions, but did not
   improve oxygenation. No extubatable due to high A-a gradient.
   - F/U CT chest to eval A-a gradient re: ? PE and LLL infiltrate likely
   due to BAL, but given GPC on gram stain from BAL will continue
   VANCOMYCIN
   - Day 11 of Intubation
   - I/O
 even to neg 500 ml
   - Continue prednisone; tapering down
 3 days 40 mg, then to 20 x3
   days, 10 x3 days
 started 10 mg [**12-9**]
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - Treated for 10 day course with broad spectum antibiotic :vancomycin,
   zosyn, ciprofloxacin
 now all stopped
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all negative
   or NGTD
   - Methadone 20 mg IV Q12H
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, one fever to 101 likely in setting of
   BAL. Also started VANC for GPCs on BAL.. Fever to 102 prior to
   presentation, earlier fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary
   syndrome, then VAP.  CT shows bilateral consolidations, likely
   atelectasis, but treating for infection given immunocompromised status.
   - New BAL with GPCs, On VANC, pending speciation
   - Urinalysis, culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease, and respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital with severe COPD and acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been intubated for 11 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has a history of acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, anemia, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia. He is on a variety of medications, including antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed an infection while on mechanical ventilation. This is a common complication in critically ill patients and can be caused by various pathogens. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.

2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient initially presented with symptoms of a heart attack, and it is important to continue monitoring his cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for any further ischemic events. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel should be continued.

3. Congestive heart failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction with a reduced ejection fraction. Fluid overload should be carefully managed to prevent exacerbation of heart failure. Diuretics may"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU due to myocardial infarction (MI) and respiratory failure. The patient has two subsegmental filling defects on CT, which are consistent with small pulmonary embolisms (PE). Heparin has been started without a bolus.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased, and their stool is greenish, so a guaiac test will be done to check for blood in the stool. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,911 mL and output of 1,755 mL, indicating a positive balance of 1,156 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and Lasix. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/72 mmHg to 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a ventilator set at CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 40%.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 226 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2)"

- Discontinued vancomycin yesterday.
- Hematocrit remained stable.
- Sputum culture showed rare gram-negative rods (GNRs), but antibiotics were not adjusted.
- The patient's condition worsened overnight with copious secretions, so the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 8 cmH2O.
- The patient's partner was consulted regarding the prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   continue to be consistent with obstructive disease.  Emerging pneumonia
   Converted solumedrol to prednisone [**1-1**] and on prednisone wean.
   Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia after
   developed infiltrate, increased secretions
 s/p BAL [**1-2**], completed
   course vanc/cipro/zosyn.  Diuresed [**2034-1-2**] given evidence of increased
   volume by CXR and secretions, but did not improve oxygenation. Not yet
   extubatable due to high A-a gradient. Failed to meet diuresis goal
   overnight; should get more fluid off today to try to gain ground on
   maximizing respiratory capacity. PE seen on CT; relatively small but
   with pt with lack of pulmonary and cardiac reserve we are treating this
   aggressively with heparin
   - continue heparin, see issue re Hct drop below
   - unclear whether he has pneumonia; [**1-6**] showed gram positives on gram
   stain, some GNRs on culture; not clear evidence of pneumonia currently;
   low threshold to restart abx
   - Day 12 of Intubation
   - I/O
 even to neg 500 ml
   - Continue prednisone; tapering down
 3 days 40 mg, 20 x3 days, 10 x3
   days
 started 10 mg [**12-9**]
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone

   or NGTD
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, one fever to 101 likely in setting of
   BAL. Also started VANC for GPCs on BAL.. Fever to 102 prior to
   presentation, earlier fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary
   syndrome, then VAP.
   - [**7-7**] BAL with GPCs, no speciation; GNRs
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, captopril
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Goal I/O
 -500ml to 1L out today
   - On metoprolol, captopril
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since. Recent drop in Hct today in setting of
   restarting heparin.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   - PM Hcts
   - continue heparin for now-
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: At baseline.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV 12HR
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more
   stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, and multiple medical complications. The summary of the note includes the following information:

- The patient was transferred from OSH with respiratory failure and acute coronary syndrome.
- He has severe COPD, and ventilator mechanics continue to be consistent with obstructive disease.
- There is a presumptive diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient has completed a course of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and zosyn. However, he still has increased secretions and a high A-a gradient, making him not yet extubatable.
- The patient also has a pulmonary embolism (PE) seen on CT, which is being treated aggressively with heparin.
- His I/O output is negative, and he has an ongoing issue with fluid overload.
- The patient's immune system is compromised due to advanced AIDS, with a CD4 count of 28 and viral load of 65. He is on an integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART regimen.
- He has a history of peripheral neuropathy and a recent T8 compression fracture, which may be related to stavudine toxicity.
- Other comorbidities include acute coronary syndrome, acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, acute-on-chronic anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, and respiratory failure due to severe COPD. He was transferred from OSH with acute coronary syndrome. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, presumptive diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, acute-on-chronic anemia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient also has HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 28 and viral load of 65. He has peripheral neuropathy and a recent T8 compression fracture.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 92/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 653 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 52.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 34.9%, platelet count of 140 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 74 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The patient's imaging studies reveal a CT scan with a pulmonary embolism (PE) seen, as well as evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's medications include prednisone, heparin, combivent, albuterol, beclomethasone, and various antibiotics.

The patient's current plan includes continuing heparin therapy for the PE, tapering down prednisone, and considering extubation when the patient's oxygenation improves. The patient's care team is monitoring his fluid balance, respiratory status, and daily wake-up trials for ventilator weaning. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of his congestive heart failure and renal function. The patient's advanced AIDS and low CD4 count put him at risk for opportunistic infections. Close monitoring of his respiratory status, fluid balance, and medication regimen will be essential to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
   continue to be consistent with obstructive disease.  Emerging pneumonia
   Converted solumedrol to prednisone [**1-1**] and on prednisone wean.
   Presumptive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia after
   developed infiltrate, increased secretions
 s/p BAL [**1-2**], completed
   course vanc/cipro/zosyn.  Diuresed [**2034-1-2**] given evidence of increased
   volume by CXR and secretions, but did not improve oxygenation. Not yet
   extubatable due to high A-a gradient. Failed to meet diuresis goal
   overnight; should get more fluid off today to try to gain ground on
   maximizing respiratory capacity. PE seen on CT; relatively small but
   with pt with lack of pulmonary and cardiac reserve we are treating this
   aggressively with heparin
   Likely multifactorial at this point with new PE and potential new
   infection given increase in secretions overnight. Will repeat mini-bal
   and start vanc/zosysn x 8 days.
   Repeat TTE to assess right sided pressures in light of the new PE. Aim
   TBB -500 to 1 L today. Remain reluctant to extubate given ongoing poor
   oxygenation.
   - continue heparin, see issue re Hct drop below
   - unclear whether he has pneumonia; [**1-6**] showed gram positives on gram
   stain, some GNRs on culture; not clear evidence of pneumonia currently;
   low threshold to restart abx
   - Day 12 of Intubation
   - I/O
 even to neg 500 ml
   - Continue prednisone; tapering down
 3 days 40 mg, 20 x3 days, 10 x3
   days
 started 10 mg [**12-9**]
   - Continue combivent Q4H with albuterol Q1-2H PRN
   - Continue beclomethasone
   - BAL [**1-2**] for: Bronchial culture & gram stain; Legionella culture;
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Pneumocystis smear; CMV
   culture; Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Fungal culture
 all negative
   or NGTD
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, one fever to 101 likely in setting of
   BAL. Also started VANC for GPCs on BAL.. Fever to 102 prior to
   presentation, earlier fevers.  Initially attributed to acute coronary
   syndrome, then VAP.
   - [**7-7**] BAL with GPCs, no speciation; GNRs
   - Urinalysis, culture
 NGTD
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Stool cultures
 NGTD
   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Cardiology following; appreciate -> no intervention at this time,
   stress test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, captopril
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Goal I/O
 -500ml to 1L out today
   - On metoprolol, captopril
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since. Recent drop in Hct today in setting of
   restarting heparin.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   - PM Hcts
   - continue heparin for now-
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: At baseline.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Monitor
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue Bactrim and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV 12HR
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold fibrate for now, but can resume once more

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and other medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed an infiltrate and increased secretions while on mechanical ventilation, which raises the suspicion of VAP. The physician has started vancomycin and zosyn for presumptive diagnosis of VAP.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a new PE seen on CT scan, and the physician is treating it aggressively with heparin.

3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has completed an infarct likely in the mid-LAD territory. Cardiac enzymes trended down, but the patient is still on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and captopril.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. The physician aims to continue diuresis and monitor the patient's I/O output.

5. Anemia: The patient had a drop in Hct today in the setting of restarting heparin. The physician is monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and considering transfusion if necessary.

   CXR: worsening RLL infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old man with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in
   the setting of ACS, AECOPD and now new sub-segmental PE.
   Resp Failure: Have not made sig progress this weekend, yesterday due to
   some brinchspasm but today due to Aa gradient and inability to wean
   PEEP. Likely multifactorial at this point with new PE and potential new
   infection given increase in secretions overnight..
          1.    Increased secretions/RLL infiltrate on CXR: Will repeat
   mini-bal and start vanc/zosysn x 8 days
          2.    For AECOPD- On prednisone and ATC MDIs.
   3.     For CHF- New EF of ~20% post-ACS , on ASA/BB/ACE, no statin [**2-20**]
   interaction with HAART meds. Aim TBB -1L. Repeat TTE to assess right
   sided pressures in light of the new PE.
   4.        For PE Therapeuticly anticoagulated on heparin for PE, + low
   EF with extensive wall motion abnormalities.
    Further plans as per resident note. Reviewed and discussed.

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV, COPD, and CAD who presented with respiratory failure in the setting of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), complicated by a new pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has not made significant progress over the weekend and is now experiencing hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated troponin-T level. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray reveals worsening right lower lobe infiltrate.

The patient's plan includes increasing secretions management, repeating mini-bal, starting vancomycin and azithromycin for 8 days, providing prednisone and ATC MDIs for AECOPD, initiating treatment for congestive heart failure (CHF) with medications such as ASA, BB, and ACE inhibitors, assessing right-sided pressures with a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and continuing therapeutic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of HIV, COPD, and CAD who presented with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 173 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 74-116 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels at 2.12. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 136, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 52.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds with resonant percussion on the chest, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable.

The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of a new PE and potential infection, evidenced by an increase in secretions overnight"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with history as above p/w hypoxemic respiratory
   failure. Now with presistent elevated A-a gradient and not tolerating
   decreases in PEEP.
   Likely multifactorial at this point with new PE and potential new
   infection given increase in secretions overnight. Will repeat mini-bal
   and start vanc/zosysn x 8 days.
   Repeat TTE to assess right sided pressures in light of the new PE. Aim
   TBB -500 to 1 L today. Remain reluctant to extubate given ongoing poor
   oxygenation. Further plans as per
   resident note.

The patient is a 48-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and severe COPD exacerbation. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and is not yet extubatable due to a high A-a gradient. He also has new small right subsegmental pulmonary emboli, unclear chronicity on computed tomography angiography (CTA). There is a potential new ventilator-associated pneumonia given increased secretions overnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and cardiac support.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old man with PMH as above now with persistent hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.New PE but now stable on heparin. Also increased
   secretions and possible LLL
   ggo so suspect ongoing hypoxemia is secondary to vap. On Vanc/zosyn
   with cultures pending. Needs agressive diuresis today. RISBI 25 and
   mechanics onthe vent are excellent.
   Moderate secretions and very low P/F so not quite ready for extubation
   today. Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of HIV, low CD4 on HAART, COPD, and CAD. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and septic shock. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 104/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and daily assessment of the respiratory system are necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Regular monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation with heparin should be continued.
4. Stress ulcers:"

   and add the following points:
   48 year old man with PMH as above now with persistent hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. New PE but now stable on heparin. Also increased
   secretions and possible LLL GG opacities so suspect ongoing hypoxemia
   is secondary to vap. On Vanc/zosyn with cultures pending. Needs
   agressive diuresis today. RSBI 25 and mechanics on the vent are
   excellent.
   Moderate secretions and very low P/F so not quite ready for extubation
   today. Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, low CD4 count on HAART, COPD, and CAD. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing hypoxemia and has increased secretions. The attending physician and fellow agree with the previous notes, assessments, and plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's low respiratory system compliance (RSBI) suggests that he may require prolonged mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Ventilator-associated complications: Given the patient's current status on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectasis, and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive net fluid intake of 1,797 mL over the past 24 hours. This indicates fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
4. Infection: The patient's increased secretions and suspicion of ongoing hypoxemia secondary to vap suggest a possible ongoing infection. The attending physician has started the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of HIV, low CD4 on HAART, COPD, and CAD who is experiencing respiratory failure in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/67 to 121/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including acyclovir, azithromycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), piperacillin, and vancomycin. Insulin and fentanyl infusions are being administered, along with other medications such as methadone hydrochloride.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.8 K/uL, hematocrit of 30.5%, platelet count of 142 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 89 to 138 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T, CK/CKMB, lactic acid, LDH, and liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, with no signs of distress or abnormal neurological findings. The patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and demonstrates purposeful movement.

The assessment and plan highlight the patient's persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, new pulmonary embolism (PE), increased secretions, and possible left lower lobe (LLL) opacities on imaging. The patient is stable on heparin, receiving vancomycin and zosyn (piperacillin), and requires aggressive diuresis. The patient's RSBI is 25, and mechanical ventilation parameters are excellent. The patient is not yet ready for extubation due to moderate secretions and low PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, a new PE, increased secretions, and possible LLL opacities. The patient is being treated with aggressive diuresis, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation. Further plans are outlined in the resident's note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and an acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated for 13 days. The patient also has a new diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His condition is complicated by several comorbidities, including HIV/AIDS, anemia, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and a recent T8 compression fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is not yet extubatable due to a high A-a gradient and severe COPD, which is consistent with obstructive disease. There is also a potential new ventilator-associated pneumonia given increased secretions and a possible new infiltrate.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient completed an infarct likely involving the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes trended down, indicating improvement. However, he remains at risk for further cardiac complications.

3. Acute-on-Chronic Diastolic and Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, indicating impaired cardiac function. This places him at risk"

   48 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 827**] transferred from OSH with
   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Not yet extubatable due to high A-a gradient.
   Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics consistent with
   obstructive disease.  New small right subsegmental pulmonary emboli on
   CTA [**1-6**].  Potential new ventilator associated pneumonia given
   increased secretions, ?new infiltrate.
   - Continue treatment for COPD exacerbation with prednisone, combivent,
   beclomethasone, additional albuterol PRN
 prednisone at 10 mg started

   - stop vancomycin and zosyn as all cx neg
   - Continuing heparin gtt
   - Goal I/O negative -1-2L
   - Repeat TTE shows severely depressed EF
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, though temps up to 100.1 over last 24
   hrs; increased secretions and possible infiltrate (vs increased
   pulmonary edema).
   - stop vancomycin and zosyn as all cx neg

   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Seen by Cardiology following -> no intervention at this time, stress
   test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix; hold metoprolol and captopril for today
   given that diuresis is the priority
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Goal I/O negative 1-2L
   - Holding metoprolol and captopril for now, diuresing as described
   above, restart soon
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since.  Hematocrit remains stable on heparin
   drip.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue bactrim and azithromycin for PCP and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
   respectively
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding fibrate, could consider restarting soon

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of allergies to certain medications, including amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and Valium. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were administered on 01/09/2124 at 8:00 AM (Azithromycin and Bactrim), 01/10/2124 at 8:40 PM (Vancomycin), and 01/11/2124 at 01:00 AM (Acyclovir), as well as 06:03 AM (Piperacillin).

The patient is currently on several infusions, including midazolam (Versed) at 0.5 mg/hour, fentanyl at 125 mcg/hour, heparin sodium at 1,750 units/hour, and furosemide (Lasix) at 12 mg/hour. Additionally, the patient is receiving methadone hydrochloride and heparin sodium through other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate ranging from 68 to 97 bpm, blood pressure between 76/53 and 100/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, COPD, and CAD, presenting with respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, decreased ejection fraction, and possible left ventricular thrombus. The patient is currently on IV heparin and receiving empiric vancomycin and zosyn for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), although cultures have been negative. The plan is to attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) but may fail due to increased pre-load. Aggressive diuresis will be administered today. Further plans will be determined by the resident. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with a sub-segmental PE, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular strain.
3. Left ventricular thrombus: The possible presence of a left ventricular thrombus increases the risk of systemic embolization, including stroke or other organ ischemia.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite negative cultures, the patient is still at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation.
5. Decreased ejection fraction: The patient's decreased ejection fraction indicates compromised cardiac function, which can lead to"

   Patient is critically ill
   At time of signing, patient was successfully extubated. Will continue
   diuresis as planned.
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, COPD, and CAD who presented with acute respiratory failure, acute chest syndrome, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). He has also been diagnosed with sub-segmental pulmonary embolism (PE), decreased ejection fraction, and possible left ventricular thrombus. The patient is currently on intravenous heparin and receiving empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), despite negative cultures. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be attempted, but it may fail due to increased pre-load. Aggressive diuresis is planned for today, and further plans will be determined by the resident. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has a sub-segmental PE, and further complications such as massive PE or recurrent PE can occur if not properly managed.
3. Left ventricular thrombus: The presence of a possible LV thrombus increases the risk of systemic embolization, including cerebral embolism or myocardial infarction.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's critical condition and the possibility of worsening respiratory status, ARDS"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of myocardial infarction. The patient's goal was to diurese, but the Lasix was uptitrated too slowly during the day and resulted in a positive fluid balance at midnight. From midnight, the Lasix infusion was increased to 12 mg/hr. The patient's partner visited and expressed that the patient's biological family does not want to be involved in his care.

The patient has allergies to amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and Valium. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotic treatments, including azithromycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), piperacillin, acyclovir, and vancomycin.

The patient is receiving several infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and furosemide. Other medications include methadone hydrochloride and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/90 to 150/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 4,476 mL of fluid intake and 1,820 mL of fluid output since midnight,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with advanced AIDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, severe COPD, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, which has since resolved. He is currently on treatment for COPD exacerbation and being monitored for new small right subsegmental pulmonary emboli. The patient's fevers have subsided, and his cardiac enzymes have trended down following an acute coronary syndrome. He has completed an infarct likely in the mid-left anterior descending artery with stenosis. His ejection fraction (EF) has decreased to 20-25%, down from a previous level of 30%. The patient also has acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure, acute-on-chronic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and a recent T8 compression fracture. His HIV/AIDS is well-documented with a CD4 count of 28 and a viral load of 65. He is currently on antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and prophylactic medications for fungal, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and Staphylococcus aureus infections. The patient's hyperlipidemia has been noted, and he is being treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe COPD and recent respiratory failure. There is a risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual who was extubated today. They have a history of allergies to Amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, morphine, and Valium. The patient's pain levels remain moderate, primarily located in the back. They are experiencing worsened back pain and have been given 12.5mcg of fentanyl twice due to intolerance to morphine and dilaudid.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including piperacillin, vancomycin, and acyclovir. They are currently on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as methadone hydrochloride and fentanyl.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted pain in the back. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature within normal range. Blood pressure is slightly low but within acceptable limits. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within normal range. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total input of fluids and has had a blood product transfusion. Urine output is within normal limits. The patient is using a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set FiO2 of 50%. ABG results show a slightly alkalotic pH and adequate oxygenation.

Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of certain parameters such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic response, movement, and tone.

   respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.
    # Respiratory failure: Not yet extubatable due to high A-a gradient.
   Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics consistent with
   obstructive disease.  New small right subsegmental pulmonary emboli on
   CTA [**1-6**].  Potential new ventilator associated pneumonia given
   increased secretions, ?new infiltrate.
   - Continue treatment for COPD exacerbation with prednisone, combivent,
   beclomethasone, additional albuterol PRN
 prednisone at 10 mg started
   [**1-8**]
   - stop vancomycin and zosyn as all cx neg
   - Continuing heparin gtt
   - Goal I/O negative -1-2L
   - Repeat TTE shows severely depressed EF
   # Fevers: Afebrile for many days, though temps up to 100.1 over last 24
   hrs; increased secretions and possible infiltrate (vs increased
   pulmonary edema).
   - stop vancomycin and zosyn as all cx neg
   - [**1-6**] BAL
 OP flora
   - Urinalysis, culture

   - Continue to CIS >100.4
   # Acute coronary syndrome: Completed infarct
 likely mid-LAD
   stenosis.  Cardiac enzymes trended down.
   - Seen by Cardiology following -> no intervention at this time, stress
   test when improved
   - Continue aspirin, plavix; hold metoprolol and captopril for today
   given that diuresis is the priority
   - Statin discontinued as outpatient due to interaction with HAART
   regimen
   # Acute-on-chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: EF
   20-25% down from prior 30%.
   - Goal I/O negative 1-2L
   - Holding metoprolol and captopril for now, diuresing as described
   above, restart soon
   - Cardiology follow-up as an outpatient for question AICD
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Had BRBPR in setting of heparin gtt and
   integrillin gtt, none since.  Hematocrit remains stable on heparin
   drip.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse < 21 or active bleeding
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 count 28 with viral load 65.  Known to have virus with
   NNRTI resistance.  On integrase inhibitor as part of his HAART.
   - Continue home HAART regimen
   - Continue fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis
   - Continue bactrim and azithromycin for PCP and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
   respectively
   # Peripheral neuropathy/recent T8 compression fracture: Neuropathy
   presumed due to stavudine toxicity, per old notes on the OMR; on a very
   large home narcotic requirement.  Compression fracture noted on
   outpatient chest x-ray
 chronic on imaging here.
   - Methadone 20 mg IV
   - Outpatient evaluation for pathologic fractures

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient was extubated without incident and his condition has been stable. He is currently on a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with FiO2 set at 50% to maintain SpO2 levels above 95%. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/75 mmHg to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,931 mL, total output of 3,827 mL, and a negative balance of -1,896 mL. His blood work indicates normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, electrolytes, and kidney function. Other lab results are also within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are elevated but not excessively high. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a PO diet, and he will be transferred to the floor today. Further plans will be determined by the resident.
