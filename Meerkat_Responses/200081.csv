   I have seen and examined the patient and rounded with team on patient.
   I agree fully with note and it reflects the collective team opinion.
   Duration of time spent on patient care: 40 min
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma evacuation who presents with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also has fevers, and the note mentions several potential complications and ongoing assessments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has already experienced a massive bilateral PE with evidence of right heart dysfunction. Pressures have remained stable so far, and the patient is currently on heparin and coumadin. If the patient becomes hypotensive and not responsive to fluids, thrombolysis may be necessary, which carries a risk of increased intracranial pressure due to the recent subdural hematoma.

2. Fever: The patient has an unclear source of fever, but it is likely related to a pulmonary cause given the left lower lobe infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray. The patient is already receiving antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin, and further follow-up with blood cultures, urine cultures, and consideration of additional imaging for the hip fluid collection may be needed.

3. Subdural hematoma: The patient has a history of recent subdural hematoma evacuation. Neuro checks are stable, but it can be challenging to assess due to a language barrier. Continued monitoring, a CT head with any changes in neuro exam, and consideration of keppra may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma evacuation, presenting with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also has fevers, and there are new infiltrates on the left lower lobe of the lung. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with heparin and coumadin for the PE/DVT. He is also receiving antibiotics for a suspected infection, as indicated by the fever and rigors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a large PE with evidence of right heart dysfunction. It is crucial to monitor the patient's vital signs and pulmonary pressures closely. If the patient becomes hypotensive and not responsive to fluids, thrombolysis may be necessary, which carries a risk of bleeding in the brain.
2. Infection: The patient has fevers and new infiltrates on the left lower lobe of the lung, suggesting a possible pneumonia or aspiration. The patient is already receiving antibiotics, but blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures need to be followed up to identify the source of infection.
3. Fluid Collection in the Hip: A fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles may represent a hematoma, fluid collection-abscess, or muscular infarction. Clinical correlation is recommended, and an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically concerning.

   FINDINGS: A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the
   subcutaneous
   tissue at the left groin just superomedial to the femoral vessels is
   consistent with hematoma. Patent flow is identified in the left common

   2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral
   artery.
   Echo [**3-2**]:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The RV is now well seen
   but appears normal in size (function cannot be adequately assessed on
   this study). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
   apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.

   2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
   right
   and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
   subsegmental
   branches.
   3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles
   may
   represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction. This is also at the

   I have reviewed the progress note history and physical examination on
   [**2142-3-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 1558**] above.  I was present during the
   pertinent portions of the physical examination today.   I concur with
   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 69 year old man with a history of DVT
   and PE developed a subdural hematoma while on oral warfarin therapy.
   While off warfarin, he developed a saddle pulmonary embolus.  An IVC
   filter was placed.  He was made a slow recovery but recently developed
   a temperature to 105 (now 101) without obvious source of the
   infection.  The likely sources are pulmonary or a potential for a left
   hip abscess.  On examination today, there was much less hip tenderness
   and the abdomen is soft in the LLQ.  He has rales bilaterally and we
   will add diuresis with furosemide to day to obtain approximately
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 264**] cc negative.  We will continue his current medical therapy
   with antibiotics and assess his symptomatic response.
   ASSESSMENT:  s/p sudural hematoma
                               Massive PE with residual hypoxemia and
   atelectasis
                                Left hip pain s/p left hip replacement
   with fluid (abscess v. hematoma) left retroperitoneal space
   PLAN:                     Continue current medical therapy with IV
   diuresis and monitoring for recurrent PE

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma post-evacuation.
- He presented with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient now has fevers and shows signs of right heart dysfunction.
- He is currently on heparin and Coumadin and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.
- If the patient becomes hypotensive and unresponsive to fluids, thrombolysis may be necessary, which poses a risk to his head.
- The patient's INR is elevated, so Coumadin should be held, and the INR should be rechecked tomorrow.
- The patient's fever could be due to the breakdown of PE or a possible abscess in the left hip.
- The patient is improving on current antibiotics, but if he worsens again, the hip will need to be aspirated.
- The patient's abdominal ileus appears to be resolving, as he has stools and bowel sounds, although he still appears distended.
- His subdural hematoma is stable, and he will continue with the same treatment plan.
- The patient's hypertension will be managed by holding antihypertensives for now.
- His hyperlipidemia will continue to be managed with a statin.

   Imaging: [**3-2**] - left femoral ultrasound
   FINDINGS: A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the
   subcutaneous
   tissue at the left groin just superomedial to the femoral vessels is
   consistent with hematoma. Patent flow is identified in the left common
   femoral artery and left common femoral vein on color and Doppler
   imaging. No
   pseudoaneurysm is seen arising from the left common femoral artery, and
   there
   is no evidence of arteriovenous fistula at this site.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Hematoma at the left groin.
   2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral
   artery.
   Echo [**3-2**]:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The RV is now well seen
   but appears normal in size (function cannot be adequately assessed on
   this study). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
   apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.
   [**3-1**]: CT thorax
   1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung
   parenchyma most compatible with infectious etiology.
   2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
   right
   and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
   subsegmental
   branches.
   3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles
   may
   represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction. This is also at the
   location of
   previous interventions in the left groin for IVC filter placement.
   Clinical
   correlation is recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess
   formation, an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.
   4. Renal cysts, liver cysts and enlarged prostate.

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old male with history of recent subdural hematoma s/p
   evacuation presents with massive bilateral PE and DVT. Now has fevers.
   # Pulmonary embolism: Large with evidence of right heart dysfunction.
   Pressures have remained stable so far. On heparin gtt and coumadin
   currently. Also has IVC filter inplace. If becomes hypotensive and not
   responsive to fluids may have to thrombolyse, which puts head at risk.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 60
   - continue coumadin - bridge with heparin 2 days
   - keep SaO2 > 92% RA
   - activity with PT, incentive spirometer, to chair
   - follow up final CTA read
   # Fever: Unclear source but very high fever. ?pulmonary with LLL
   infiltrates on CXR. CTA did not show very large pneumonia or
   aspiration. Rigors suggesting bacteremia.
   - continue cefepime/vanc for now (day 2)
   - follow up blood cultures
   - follow up urine cultures
   - follow up final CTA read
   - attempt sputum cultures
   - tylenol PRN for fever
   - speech and swallow consult
   - trend T and WBC
   - consider further imaging of fluid collection of hip
   # Subdural hematoma: Stable per neuro checks. Can be difficult to
   assess at times due to language barrier.
   - continue above
   - CT head with any changes in neuro exam
   - keppra
   # Abdominal ileus: no abdominal pain. Has stools and bowel sounds.
   Still appears distended. No nausea or vomiting.
   - speech and swallow consult
   - advance diet per above
   - continue bowel regimen
   # HTN: hold antihypertensives for now
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma who presents with massive bilateral PE and DVT. He is currently experiencing worsening left hip/thigh pain, and orthopedic consultation was performed due to concern for septic prosthetic joint. However, imaging shows a hematoma rather than infection. The patient also has fever and rigors, suggesting possible bacteremia. He is on heparin and coumadin for his PE and DVT, and an IVC filter has been placed. The patient's right heart size has improved with an ejection fraction of 50-55%. He is making poor urine, so he was bolused with 500cc. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: Up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit
- Heart rate: 85 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 104/59 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on medium concentration mask

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 9.4 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
- Platelet count: 116 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- Glucose: 129 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 2.5 mmol/L
- Magnesium: 2"
