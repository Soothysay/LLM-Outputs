","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- The patient was admitted on [**9-18**] after a hypotensive episode at [**Hospital 6791**] and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
- The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure improved with ultrafiltration (UF) removal of 2 liters, and he is currently stable on home oxygen at 3 liters per nasal cannula (NC).
- The patient's decompensation is most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema, with possible predisposition from anxiety and respiratory depression due to narcotics/anxiolytics.
- The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia.
- Volume management with hemodialysis (HD) is planned.
- Follow-up pending culture data.
- The patient will continue on advair and nebs as needed.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) may be considered to evaluate pump function given the patient's history of CAD and myocardial infarction (MI).
- Chronic diarrhea is noted, but none"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen therapy, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted on 09/18 after experiencing hypotensive episode at Hospital 6791 and transferred to MICU on 09/22 due to hypoxemic respiratory failure most attributable to pulmonary edema and nosocomial pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia, which is a type of infection acquired during hospitalization. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and may require antibiotic treatment.
2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 390 mL since 12 AM, indicating potential volume overload. This can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, although it is currently not present. Further evaluation and management are recommended to identify the underlying cause.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT levels, indicating coagulopathy. Vitamin K supplementation has been administered, and further evaluation of coagulation status is necessary.
5. Cardiovascular function: Given the patient's history of CAD and myocardial infarction (MI), consideration should be given to evaluating cardiac function using tools such as a"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a hypotensive episode and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was most likely due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is stable on home oxygen at 3 liters per nasal cannula (NC). He has a right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which is positioned to the level of the lower superior vena cava (SVC)/cavoatrial junction. The tip of the PICC line could not be clearly visualized, but it appears to be at least at the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose levels, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). Imaging reveals bilateral parenchymal opacities, indicating pre-existing lung conditions, and the tip of the nasogastric (NG) tube is in the stomach. There are no signs of pneumothorax or complications related to the PICC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU on [9-18] after experiencing a hypotensive episode and transferred from MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, ESRD on hemodialysis (HD), CAD, COPD, DM, depression/anxiety, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's main concern is his worsening hypoxemia, which could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's delirium and confusion may progress, leading to increased risk of falls, self-harm, or difficulty in weaning off sedatives.
3. Chronic diarrhea: Although the patient's diarrhea is currently under evaluation, recurrent or uncontrolled diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's kidney disease requires ongoing management, and complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and anemia may arise if not properly managed.
5. CAD: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
6. COPD"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on [9-22] after experiencing a hypotensive episode at another hospital and was transferred for hypoxemic respiratory failure, most likely due to pulmonary edema and nosocomial pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status but not delirium, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 172/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a venti mask.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 177 mg/dL, and normal creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the MICU on [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was initially attributed to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Despite receiving antibiotics and fluid management, the patient's oxygenation did not improve. His fever curve and leukocytosis are trending downward.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxemic respiratory failure due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. There is a potential for further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is most likely due to infection and hypoxemia. This could progress to delirium or worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Chronic Diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, which may be related to poor intake or underlying gastrointestinal issues. Further evaluation and management are required.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. His renal function needs close monitoring, and adjustments to his renal regimen may be necessary.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and his cardiovascular management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen therapy, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on [**9-18**] after experiencing hypotensive episode at another hospital and transferred from MICU to the ICU on [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was most attributable to pulmonary edema and nosocomial pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, and COPD. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for nosocomial/aspiration pneumonia and has undergone several interventions including volume management with HD/UF, uptitration of beta-blockers, and addition of ACE inhibitors to improve filling time and afterload to reduce the risk of acute diastolic heart failure. The patient is also on inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration in neurologic status, development of renal complications due to ESRD on HD, exacerbation of COPD, uncontrolled diabetes, and cardiovascular events related to CAD.

Further evaluation and management are planned based on pending culture data, assessment of gastrointestinal involvement, re"

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus (DM).
- He presented with poor mental status and tachypnea, but has improved after several extra hemodialysis (HD) sessions.
- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He is currently on multiple medications, including metoprolol, captopril, seroquel, cefepime, vancomycin, heparin sodium, atrovent, rissole, cef, colace, clindamycin, zoloft, plavix, iron, MVI, ranitidine, lidocaine, tylenol, and others.
- The patient's allergies include morphine.
- The last dose of antibiotics was given on September 27th at 02:02 AM.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for agitated and delirious behavior.
- Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.
- Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities.
- The patient's mental status remains altered, likely due to toxic-metabolic causes.
- He has a history of pneumonia, but the MRSA screen was negative.
- There is concern for an anaerobic infection, so the plan is to finish"

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD, DM, CAD and COPD, here with fluid overload, poor mental
   status, and pneumonia. Significant improvement with increased HD
   sessions is reassuring, although he remains on broad abx and standing
   tylenol
   For pneumonia, unable to obtain adequate sputum and mrsa screen is
   negative. Given the cavity, there is some concern an anaerobic
   infection. Will plan to finsh 8-day course of vanco/cefepime, and start
   flagyl for anaerobic infection for at least a 4 wk with plans to
   reimage chest after completion of course.
   Waiting to clarify possible h/o C.diff (per wife).
   Delirium persists, likely toxic-metabolic. Previously on seroquel very
   high dose; will hold off now but may need it tonight.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with poor mental status and tachypnea, which have significantly improved after several extra hemodialysis (HD) sessions.

The patient's allergies include morphine, with unknown specific reaction. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and clindamycin) and vancomycin due to pneumonia. The MRSA screen is negative, but there is concern for an anaerobic infection due to a cavity seen on imaging. The plan is to finish an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime, and start Flagyl for anaerobic infection for at least 4 weeks with plans to reimage the chest after completion.

The patient's delirium persists, likely due to toxic-metabolic causes. He was previously on a very high dose of seroquel but is currently holding off. It may be needed tonight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 78-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/59 mmHg to 169/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, DM, COPD on home O2, and CAD. He was admitted on [**9-18**] after a hypotensive episode at [**Hospital 6791**] and transferred to MICU [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, ESRD on HD, CAD, COPD, DM, and depression/anxiety.

The patient's recent events include removing 1.6L by HD, stopped short of goal -2L because the patient became tachypneic and looked unwell. He was desatted, put on NRB, then BiPap with some improvement. The patient also had a fever of 101.1 at 12:10am and was pan-cultured. His last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on [**2155-9-26**] at 08:00 PM, clindamycin was changed to flagyl on [**2155-9-27**] due to a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe, and vancomycin was started on [**2155-9-27**] at 11:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 (101.1), heart rate of 96 (82-120) bpm, blood pressure of 150/49 (74) mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 (16-34) inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on BiPap support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 14.4, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, glucose of 102 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 35 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows no significant change since [**2155-9-25**], with extensive parenchymal opacities that have a perihilar distribution, concerning for an infectious process and less concerning for pulmonary edema. The NG tube tip is in the stomach, and the right PICC line tip may be in the proximal right atrium.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure, worsening encephalopathy, development of further infections, exacerbation of chronic diarrhea, worsening renal function, cardiovascular events, exacerbation of COPD, and uncontrolled diabetes.

Based on the information provided, the patient's current conditions and potential complications, it is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, mental status, infection control measures, fluid balance, and renal function. The patient should continue to receive appropriate antibiotic therapy, BiPap support as tolerated, and efforts should be made to optimize his glycemic control, pain management, and overall comfort."

The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted on 9/18 after a hypotensive episode at another hospital and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxemic respiratory failure, primarily due to pulmonary edema and nosocomial pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy likely due to infection and hypoxemia, chronic diarrhea, ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, depression/anxiety, COPD, and cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung. 

The patient underwent hemodialysis but stopped short of goal due to becoming tachypneic and looking unwell. He was desatted and put on a non-rebreather mask, then bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPap) with some improvement. The patient was also pan-cultured and started on flagyl for the cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital on 9/18 after a hypotensive episode and subsequently transferred to the MICU on 9/22 due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including altered mental status, renal failure, and recurrent aspiration events. He has been receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), antibiotics, and other supportive measures. The patient's fever is of unclear etiology, and cultures are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a compromised respiratory system. The ongoing use of NIPPV and antibiotics suggests an ongoing effort to manage this condition. However, the patient remains tenuous, indicating that respiratory failure remains a significant concern.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to several factors, including encephalopathy, medication side effects, or complications from his underlying medical conditions. It is crucial to closely monitor his neurological status and consider appropriate interventions to address this issue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted on [**9-18**] after experiencing a hypotensive episode and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxemic respiratory failure most likely due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

The patient has been unresponsive to antibiotics and hemodialysis/ultrafiltration (HD/UF). He has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime for nosocomial pneumonia, but these were stopped on [**9-27**]. Clindamycin was changed to Flagyl due to cavitary consolidation on chest CT, and it will be completed for a two-week course in the setting of persistent fevers and history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

The patient is being maintained on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as tolerated, as it appears to provide more comfort. There is slightly elevated carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) on recent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

Volume management with HD/UF is being continued, although the contribution of volume overload to the current clinical picture is minimal. The patient is also on beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (BB/"

- Current assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, ESRD on HD, CAD, COPD, DM, and depression/anxiety.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-146/41-83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, poor dentition, and an NG tube in place.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as elevated glucose levels.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows no acute process."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**9-18**] after experiencing a hypotensive episode and was subsequently transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
- Altered mental status (not delirium)
- Renal failure, end stage (ESRD)

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and has been on vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime (Cefipime) antibiotics for two weeks. Additionally, the patient has been prescribed Flagyl for a possible area of cavitation in the lungs.

The patient's encephalopathy remains somnolent, and potential causes include hypoxia and infection. Sedating medications have been withheld.

The patient's chronic renal failure (CRF) is being managed with intermittent hemodialysis (HD). However, there are no clear indications for HD today, and the possibility of holding HD due to the patient's worsening status is being considered.

A family conference is recommended to discuss the patient's current status and future plans.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support, glycemic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the MICU on 9/22 for hypoxemic respiratory failure, primarily due to nosocomial pneumonia and secondary to acute pulmonary edema. The patient has shown clinical improvement and is now stable on home oxygen. He completed an 8-day antibiotic course for nosocomial pneumonia and is continuing with Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia/cavitation seen on chest CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to nosocomial pneumonia. Although he has shown improvement, there is still a risk of complications such as worsening respiratory status or development of multi-drug resistant organisms.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is on Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia/cavitation seen on chest CT. This indicates a risk of further aspiration events leading to recurrent pneumonia or worsening respiratory status.
3. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient's initial hypoxemic respiratory failure was also attributed to acute pulmonary edema. There is a potential risk of recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema in the future.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU on 9/18 after experiencing a hypotensive episode during hemodialysis (HD). The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, most likely due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He has also shown signs of encephalopathy, which could be related to dialysis sessions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and other ICU medications. The patient's family has expressed their desire for aggressive measures to facilitate his transition home safely, including the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and intubation if sudden respiratory failure occurs.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These may include:

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia and has a history of end-stage renal disease. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have shown no improvement. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring adjustments to medication. They have a nasogastric tube in place and are receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of delirium, which can be exacerbated by the use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, especially if fluid and electrolyte balance is not carefully managed.
4. Infection: Due to the presence of a nasogastric tube and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at increased risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of medications that may affect the stomach lining put them at risk for developing stress ulcers."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted on 9/18 after a hypotensive episode and transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema.

The patient has clinically improved and is now stable on home oxygen 2-3L. He completed an 8-day antibiotic course for nosocomial pneumonia and is continuing with Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia/cavitation seen on chest CT.

The patient's medical conditions include:
- ESRD on HD: He is on hemodialysis and needs to have his medications adjusted accordingly. Epo and Zemplar should be administered with HD, and renal recommendations should be appreciated.
- CAD: The patient is on aspirin, Plavix, and a beta-blocker. A statin should also be added.
- COPD: The patient's Advair was changed to HFA due to poor compliance with proper use of the diskus.
- HTN: The patient's antihypertensive regimen should be deferred at this time as he tends towards hypotension with HD. Captopril was increased to 25 mg TID, and metoprolol should be increased to 37.5 mg if still hypertensive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted on 9/18 after a hypotensive episode at HD with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. He was transferred to the MICU on 9/22 for hypoxemic respiratory failure most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, diabetes, COPD, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD with poor secretion management, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Oxygen requirements have been reduced, but it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory status.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, although he had good mentation today. A head CT was negative for acute processes, but there is some concern over the temporal relationship to dialysis sessions. Monitoring during and after HD is essential.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CRF): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) today.
4. Feeding/Gastrointestinal (FEN/GI): The patient has diarrhea, and further workup is on hold until acute issues stabilize. The patient is receiving tube feeding at goal for nutrition.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high serum sodium level"

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on [9-18] after experiencing a hypotensive episode at HD, along with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory: The patient has underlying COPD and is on home oxygen. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) due to poor secretion management. Oxygen requirements have been reduced, and he is now on 2 liters of oxygen.
- Abdominal: The patient has chronic diarrhea and weight loss, which may be related to his gastrointestinal (GI) issues. Further workup for GI problems is pending stabilization.
- Neurological: The patient has had fluctuations in mental status, but his head CT scan is negative for any acute process. There are concerns regarding the temporal relationship between his dialysis sessions and his encephalopathy. Monitoring during and after HD today will be important.
- Cardiovascular: The patient has very high blood pressure (SBP) overnight and is currently receiving hemodialysis (HD). Blood pressure medications will be titrated after HD.
- Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeding (TF) at goal for nutrition.

   60M ESRD on HD, DM, COPD on home O2, CAD admitted [**9-18**] after a
   hypotensive episode at HD with chronic diarrhea and weight loss,
   transferred to MICU [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure most
   attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
   #. Aspiration PNA: Has underlying COPD with 3 liters home oxygen
   requirement, poor secretion management, and aspiration.
   Oxygen requirements reduced
 now on 2L.
   - S/P course of vanc/cefipime x 9 days (d/c
ed [**9-29**]) as a course of
   abx has been completed.
   - Continue alb/atrovent/Advair
   - 2 wk course of flagyl for possible area of cavitation on CT
   (anaerobic coverage)
   #. Encephalopathy: Has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status, though good
   mentation today. Head CT
s negative for acute process and  sedating
   medications.  Some concern over temporal relationship to dialysis
   sessions.
   No additional management today, will need close monitoring after next
   HD session.
   #. CRF: On HD intermittently. Regular HD session scheduled today, but
   has not tolerated well in the past ((MS, hypotension) so will defer as
   no clear indication for HD.
   #. FEN/GI: Diarrhea - further w/u on hold until acute issues stabilize.
   On TF at goal for nutrition. FWF for hypernatremia.
   #.  HTN: Titrate BP meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted on [**9-18**] after experiencing a hypotensive episode and was transferred to the MICU on [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was most likely caused by nosocomial pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema.

The patient has shown clinical improvement and is now stable on home oxygen at 2-3 liters. An 8-day antibiotic course was completed for the nosocomial pneumonia, and Flagyl is being continued for aspiration pneumonia with cavitation seen on the chest CT. A repeat NCCT chest will be done in one month, and the patient will continue using advair and nebs as needed.

For ESRD on HD, the patient will receive epo and zemplar with HD and appreciate renal recs. For CAD, the patient will be prescribed ASA, plavi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure, most likely due to nosocomial pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory distress has improved with the completion of an 8-day antibiotic course and continues on home oxygen. He is also receiving flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and cavitation on chest CT.

The patient has several other medical conditions including hypertension (HTN), depression/anxiety, and hypernatremia. He is currently on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, beta-blockers, epo, zemplar, captopril, metoprolol, sertraline, and others.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 147/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. His fluid balance is positive at 1,840 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and recent respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure most likely caused by nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has shown improvement and is now ready for rehabilitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD, requires home oxygen, and has poor secretion management, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, but it is believed to be his baseline. However, there may be a risk of further deterioration or delirium.
3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis and may require ongoing management of renal function.
4. Feeding and gastrointestinal issues: The patient has diarrhea, and further evaluation of gastrointestinal function is needed. The placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been planned to provide nutrition support.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, and fluid management should be monitored closely.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has stabilized after hemodialysis, but ongoing management is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which was most likely caused by nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has shown improvement and is now ready for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD and requires home oxygen, which increases the risk of aspiration. He has poor secretion management, making him prone to developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, but it is believed to be his baseline as there are no acute processes on head CT and he is not on sedating medications. Monitoring for any further changes in mental status is important.
3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and may require ongoing monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
4. FEN/GI Issues: The patient has diarrhea, and further evaluation is needed. It is important to stabilize the patient before proceeding with any gastrointestinal workup.
5. HTN: The patient's hypertension is stable after HD and is being managed with medications.
6. Potential complications related to PEG tube placement, such as infection or aspiration, should also be considered and monitored"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a hypotensive episode during hemodialysis (HD), along with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. He was later transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure, primarily due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has shown improvement and is now ready for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD and requires home oxygen, which increases the risk of aspiration. The patient has already received a course of vancomycin and cefipime, and oxygen requirements have been reduced to 2 liters. The patient will continue with alb/atrovent/Advair and undergo a two-week course of Flagyl for possible cavitation on CT (anaerobic coverage). A follow-up CT will be done in one month.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, but good mentation in the last few days. A head CT has ruled out any acute processes, and sedating medications may be contributing to this condition. The family reports that this is the patient's baseline.
3. ESRD: The patient underwent HD yesterday and will require ongoing management for renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   60M ESRD on HD, DM, COPD on home O2, CAD admitted [**9-18**] after a
   hypotensive episode at HD with chronic diarrhea and weight loss,
   transferred to MICU [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure most
   attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
   #. Aspiration PNA: Has underlying COPD with 3 liters home oxygen
   requirement, poor secretion management, and aspiration.
   Oxygen requirements reduced
 now on 2L.
   - S/P course of vanc/cefipime x 9 days (d/c
ed [**9-29**]) as a course of
   abx has been completed.
   - Continue alb/atrovent/Advair
   - 2 wk course of flagyl for possible area of cavitation on CT
   (anaerobic coverage)
   #. Encephalopathy: Has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status, though good
   mentation today. Head CT
s negative for acute process and  sedating
   medications.  Some concern over temporal relationship to dialysis
   sessions.  Will monitor during and after HD today.
   #. CRF: On HD today.
   #. FEN/GI: Diarrhea - further w/u on hold until acute issues stabilize.
   On TF at goal for nutrition. FWF for hypernatremia.
   - Will arrange for PEG tube
   - Video swallow tomorrow am
   #.  HTN: Very high SBP overnight.  Getting HD now and will titrate BP
   meds after HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxemic respiratory failure most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. 

The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea and weight loss, and his current condition includes aspiration pneumonia (PNA), encephalopathy with fluctuating mental status, chronic kidney disease (CRF) on HD, and potential fecal impaction/enlarged prostate/gastrointestinal (FEN/GI) issues. The patient also has hypertension (HTN) and requires further evaluation for possible placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and video swallow test.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm (range: 77-107 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 117/72 mmHg (range: 81-201/41-125 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (range: 19-38 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 11.8-13.7 K/uL
- Platelet count: 76-418 K/uL
- Creatinine: 2.3-3.1 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 89-222 mg/dL
- Sodium: 33 mEq/L
- Potassium: 23.1 mEq/L
- Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 3.7 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
- Troponin-T: 0.14 ng/mL
- CK-MB: 0.20 ng/mL
- INR: 1.5
- PT/PTT: 17.1/48.6 seconds

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, further deterioration in mental status leading to encephalopathy, development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, and potential electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing diarrhea and renal dysfunction. Additionally, the patient's hypertension needs to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to prevent these potential complications."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted on 9/18 after a hypotensive episode and transferred to the MICU on 9/22 for hypoxemic respiratory failure, most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's current chief complaint is diarrhea. 

The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion on 10/2, which resulted in bleeding around the site. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a hematocrit level of 19.9 from 23.1. 

The patient is currently on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), hydralazine, metoprolol, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient also has a PICC line inserted on 9/23 and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 174/74 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement with bleeding at the site, requiring transfusion of 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's allergies include morphine, and they are currently on multiple medications including sertraline, iron, RISS, MV, Asa, ranitidine, Plavix, fluticasone, lidocaine, captopril, vitamin D, metoprolol, Flagyl, and subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD and requires home oxygen, which increases the risk of aspiration. The patient's reduced oxygen requirements indicate improvement, but the use of alb/atrovent/Advair will continue to manage COPD symptoms. A 2-week course of Flagyl has been prescribed for possible anaerobic coverage due to an area of cavitation on CT, and a follow-up CT in one month is planned.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status,"

   hypotensive episode at HD with chronic diarrhea and weight loss,
   transferred to MICU [**9-22**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure most
   attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Now improved
   and ready for rehab.
   #. Aspiration PNA: Has underlying COPD with 3 liters home oxygen
   requirement, poor secretion management, and aspiration.
   Oxygen requirements reduced
 now on 2L.
   - S/P course of vanc/cefipime x 9 days (d/c
ed [**9-29**]).
   - Continue alb/atrovent/Advair
   - 2 wk course of flagyl for possible area of cavitation on CT
   (anaerobic coverage)
 Will need f/u CT in 1 month
   - S/p PEG
   #. Encephalopathy: Has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status, though good
   mentation last few days. Head CT
s negative for acute process and
   sedating medications.  Per family, this is his baseline.
   #. ESRD: S/p HD Tuesday. No acute indications today. Plan for HD at
   rehab tomorrow.
   #. FEN/GI: Diarrhea - further w/u on hold until acute issues
   stabilize.  FWF for hypernatremia.
   - PEG tube okay to use
   - Video swallow at rehab

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU after a hypotensive episode at HD. The patient presented with chronic diarrhea and weight loss, and was transferred to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure most attributable to nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has now improved and is ready for rehab.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD and poor secretion management, which increases the risk of aspiration. The patient has already developed aspiration pneumonia.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had waxing and waning mental status, but recent assessments indicate good mentation. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely and rule out any acute processes.
3. ESRD: The patient is on HD and has stable renal function at present. However, ongoing monitoring and management of renal function is necessary.
4. FEN/GI issues: The patient has diarrhea, and further workup has been put on hold until acute issues stabilize. It is important to address the gastrointestinal symptoms to prevent further complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with elevated sodium levels. This needs to be managed appropriately to avoid complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU after experiencing a hypotensive episode during hemodialysis. The patient presented with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition improved, and he is now ready for rehabilitation.

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has underlying COPD, requires home oxygen, has poor secretion management, and is at risk for aspiration. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia and is now on a two-week course of Flagyl for possible anaerobic coverage. Follow-up CT will be done in one month.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has had fluctuating mental status, although good mentation in the last few days. A head CT scan was negative for any acute process, and sedating medications could be contributing to this condition. The family reports that this is the patient's baseline.
3. ESRD: The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday.
4. Feeding/Gastrointestinal (GI): The patient's diarrhea is being monitored, and further workup has been put on hold until acute issues stabilize. The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed, and medications"
