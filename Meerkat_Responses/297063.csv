","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of being febrile overnight. She had one episode of hypotension overnight and received a 500cc IVF bolus, which responded well. The patient has allergies to several medications including Tagamet, Ditropan, penicillins, lisinopril, and heparin agents. She has been on various ICU medications and received antibiotics until 02:00 AM. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and normal oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals positive fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CMV ventilation mode, set Vt of 550 mL, set RR of 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and good ABG results. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to patient's altered mental status. Lab results indicate normal WBC count, Hct, and platelet levels, but elevated creatinine and low potassium levels. The patient has an ongoing fever of unknown origin, hypotension, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Fluid overload: The positive"

","Summary:
- 67-year-old patient with a history of Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter MDR PNA admitted from rehab with high temperature and suspected UTI.
- Patient has been febrile overnight, with episodes of hypotension and tachycardia.
- Right arm swollen, diagnosed with Right Brachial Vein DVT.
- Currently on Vancomycin/Amikacin/Meropenem for suspected infection.
- Acute renal failure likely due to dehydration from fevers/UTI.
- Mental status change in the setting of UTI/DVT.
- Respiratory failure requiring assist control ventilation.
- Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and malnutrition also present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of MDR PNA and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected UTI. There is a possibility of persistent or new infections.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen significantly, indicating possible acute renal failure. Dehydration from fevers/UTI may be the cause.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with Right Brachial Vein DVT. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires assist control ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of colonization with Acinetobacter, enterococcus endocarditis, and MRSA pneumonia. The patient presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, thick respiratory secretions, and positive urine analysis. The patient responded well to fluids and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. It is important to identify the causative organism and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has trace swelling in the right leg, which raises concern for DVT. Further evaluation, such as a Doppler ultrasound, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL indicates potential renal impairment. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid management accordingly is essential.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary during mechanical ventilation.

5. Endocarditis: The patient's history of enterococcus endocarditis increases the risk of complications related to infective endocarditis. Regular echocardiogram assessments and blood cultures should be done to monitor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of colonization with Acinetobacter and enterococcus endocarditis, as well as MRSA pneumonia. He presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, thick respiratory secretions, and positive urine analysis. He responded well to fluids and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. The organism responsible is unclear and needs further investigation.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has trace edema in both legs, indicating a potential risk for DVT. The presence of a PICC line raises concerns about a right axillary DVT. Further evaluation is needed to determine if it is acute or chronic, organized or not.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL suggests potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying conditions. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are required.
5. Infection Control: Given the patient's colonization with Acinetobacter and MRSA, proper infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of these organisms.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, who was admitted from a rehabilitation hospital with a temperature of 104.6 degrees rectally and positive urine analysis indicating a urinary tract infection.
- The patient has been febrile overnight, and blood cultures have grown Gram-positive cocci, prompting the continuation of Vancomycin. Urine cultures have also grown Gram-negative rods, leading to the continuation of Meropenem. Additionally, yeast has been detected in the blood cultures, necessitating the initiation of Caspofungin.
- The patient's acute renal failure is believed to be caused by dehydration from fevers and a urinary tract infection. His creatinine level has risen from 1.5 to 3.1, but it has decreased to 2.7 yesterday and is now elevated again at 3.1. The patient is being given intravenous fluid boluses, and his fluid intake and output are being monitored. His fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) yesterday was 0.2%, consistent with prerenal syndrome.
- The patient has a right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was identified on ultrasound. However, since it is not a proximal vein thrombosis, the decision has been made not to treat it at this time. The patient's mental status has improved, and his respiratory failure has necessitated the placement of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas/acineterbacter MDR PNA, admitted from Hospital 858 rehab with a rectal temperature of 104.6 and positive urine analysis, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been receiving intravenous antibiotics (Vanco/Amikacin/Meropenem) and is currently on assist-control ventilation due to altered mental status in the setting of infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.1, blood pressure in the 80s, heart rate in the low 100s, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of chronic anemia and is on ferrous sulfate, but it has been held to prevent constipation. He also has a history of diabetes, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and is taking appropriate medications for these conditions.

The patient has a midline PICC line placed on 02/15/2016 and a peripheral IV line. He is on full code status and his current disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. UTI: The patient's initial presentation with fevers and positive urine analysis suggests a possible UTI. The ongoing fevers and presence of urinary catheters increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections, including UTIs. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining proper cath"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of colonization with Acinetobacter, enterococcus endocarditis, and MRSA pneumonia. He presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, thick respiratory secretions, and positive urine analysis. The patient responded well to fluids and is still febrile with elevated white blood cell count. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may require ongoing monitoring and management to maintain adequate perfusion.

2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient has had persistent fever despite receiving antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and determine appropriate treatment.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is impaired, as indicated by somnolence and reduced response to verbal stimuli. Close monitoring and assessment of neurological function are necessary.

4. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be required.

5. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has swelling in both arms, which raises concern for DVT. Further evaluation and consideration of anticoagulation therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas/acineterbacter multi-drug resistant pneumonia, who was admitted from rehab with a temperature of 104.6 and positive urine analysis, likely urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been experiencing fevers overnight, and cultures are pending. The patient is currently on vancomycin, amikacin, meropenem, and caspofungin for suspected yeast infection. The patient also has acute renal failure, right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT), change in mental status, respiratory failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheoesophageal fistula: The patient has a tracheostomy and there is a concern for a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multi-drug resistant pneumonia, and the recent fever and positive urine analysis suggest a possible new or worsening infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has an acute rise in creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This can be caused by dehydration, infection, or other factors.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right brachial DVT, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 yom s/p tracheostomy, h/o Pseudomonas/Acineterbacter MDR
   PNA who is admitted from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with sepsis, found to have
   fungemia and bacteremia as well as UTI. Persistently febrile but HD
   stable
   .
   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine cultures with
   Klebsiella. Currently on Vanc/Amikacin/Meropenem. Possible sources of
   infection include PICC line, urine and lung. All central lines now
   discontinued. Pt underwent bronch yest with no clear evidence of PNA,
   BAL sent
   - Goal MAP >65
   - No pressor requirement at this time, responsive to IVF
   - ID management as below
   #. Fungemia
 unclear source at this time but urine vs PICC most
   likely, no clear evidence of PNA
   - [**2-15**] blood cultures from rehab and here growing yeast
   - started on caspofungin yesterday
   - + yeast in urine
 will obtain renal ultrasound to evaluate for renal
   abscess, ensure foley change
   - given multiple + BC will request cards consult for TEE to evaluate
   for valve involvement, pt not a surgical candidate given comorbities
   but will define treatment duration as well as providing significant
   prognostic information
   .
   # Coagulase negative staph bacteremia
 Likely line related infection
   from PICC. On prior admission pt with 2/4 bottles from 1 set at rehab
   with CoNS felt likely contaminant, pt received 14 days vanc for MRSA
   PNA. Now with 2 bottles from rehab + on [**2-14**] and here on [**2-15**]
   - Continue Vancomycin dosed by level (goal trough 15-20)
   - follow surveillance cultures
   - all central lines now DC
   .
   # Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI - (ESBL +) Pt currently on Amikacin and
   meropenem (sensitive to meropenem)
   - will continue for now, follow up ID recs
   - Amikacin dose changed to 750mg IV Q36 based on level
   - consider DC amikacin if not needed for lung coverage given [**Last Name (un) **] S
    .
   # Hx MDR PNA - Hx of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter PNA requiring
   amikacin/colisitn, also recent MRSA PNA treated with Vancomycin -
   currently  no clear evidence of PNA, bronch completed yesterday.
   Iniital concern for possible tracheoesophageal fistula seen on CT Chest
   however bronch negative.
   - Continue current antimicrobial regimen awaiting final culture data
   from bronch
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now rising to 3.1 on admission, continues to
   worsen despite IVF, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from fevers/UTI.   FeNa [**2-16**]
   - 0.2% consistent with prerenal syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) and endocarditis. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, fungemia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been persistently febrile but hemodynamically stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MDR PNA and endocarditis, both of which can increase the risk of sepsis. He is currently being treated for sepsis with multiple antibiotics.
2. Fungemia: The patient has evidence of yeast in his blood cultures, indicating a fungal infection. He is being treated with caspofungin.
3. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: This bacteremia is likely related to a central line infection, as the patient had a PICC line which has been discontinued. He will continue to receive vancomycin.
4. Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI: The patient has an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI. He is currently on amikacin and meropenem, both of which he is sensitive to.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened despite intravenous fluids (IVF), likely due to dehydration from fevers and UTI."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   This is a 67 yom s/p tracheostomy, h/o Pseudomonas/Acineterbacter MDR
   PNA who is admitted from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with sepsis, found to have
   fungemia and bacteremia as well as UTI. Persistently febrile but HD
   stable
   .
   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine cultures with
   Klebsiella. Currently on Vanc/Amikacin/Meropenem. Possible sources of
   infection include PICC line, urine and lung. All central lines now
   discontinued. Pt underwent bronch yest with no clear evidence of PNA,
   BAL sent
   - Goal MAP >65
   - No pressor requirement at this time, responsive to IVF
   - ID management as below
   #. Fungemia
 unclear source at this time but urine vs PICC most
   likely, no clear evidence of PNA
   - [**2-15**] blood cultures from rehab and here growing yeast
   - started on caspofungin yesterday
   - + yeast in urine
 will obtain renal ultrasound to evaluate for renal
   abscess, ensure foley change
   - given multiple + BC will request cards consult for TEE to evaluate
   for valve involvement, pt not a surgical candidate given comorbities
   but will define treatment duration as well as providing significant
   prognostic information
   .
   # Coagulase negative staph bacteremia
 Likely line related infection
   from PICC. On prior admission pt with 2/4 bottles from 1 set at rehab
   with CoNS felt likely contaminant, pt received 14 days vanc for MRSA
   PNA. Now with 2 bottles from rehab + on [**2-14**] and here on [**2-15**]
   - Continue Vancomycin dosed by level (goal trough 15-20)
   - follow surveillance cultures
   - all central lines now DC
   .
   # Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI - (ESBL +) Pt currently on Amikacin and
   meropenem (sensitive to meropenem)
   - will continue for now, follow up ID recs
   - Amikacin dose changed to 750mg IV Q36 based on level
   - consider DC amikacin if not needed for lung coverage given [**Last Name (un) **] S
    .
   # Hx MDR PNA - Hx of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter PNA requiring
   amikacin/colisitn, also recent MRSA PNA treated with Vancomycin -
   currently  no clear evidence of PNA, bronch completed yesterday.
   Iniital concern for possible tracheoesophageal fistula seen on CT Chest
   however bronch negative.
   - Continue current antimicrobial regimen awaiting final culture data
   from bronch
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now rising to 3.1 on admission, continues to
   worsen despite IVF, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from fevers/UTI.   FeNa [**2-16**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) and endocarditis, admitted from a rehabilitation facility with sepsis, fungemia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently on vancomycin, amikacin, and meropenem. The possible sources of infection include the percutaneous internal jugular central line (PICC line), urine, and lung. The patient's blood cultures show yeast and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. His urine culture shows Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent bronchoscopic evaluation yesterday with no clear evidence of pneumonia. He is goal-directed for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, no pressor requirement at this time, responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF), and renal dosing of medications.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as a history of endocarditis. Recent admission with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, completed a 14-day course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures with yeast and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Currently on Vanc/Amikacin/Meropenem. Possible sources of infection include PICC line, urine, and"

The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, caspofungin, amikacin, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 126/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%, and a sinus rhythm (SR) heart rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,832 mL with total output of 1,240 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,592 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct), increased platelet count (Plt), and abnormal renal function tests, including elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab results show abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these findings include sepsis due to the presence of fever and positive blood cultures, potential infection-related hypotension, and respiratory distress. The altered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with sepsis. The patient has a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) and endocarditis. He was previously treated for MRSA pneumonia with vancomycin and readmitted with fever. Blood cultures show yeast and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Urine cultures show Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient is currently on vancomycin, amikacin, and meropenem. He has acute-on-chronic renal failure, right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT), delirium, respiratory failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and malnutrition. The patient's access lines have been removed due to positive blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fever and bacteremia, indicating ongoing infection. The source of infection is unclear but could be related to a central line or urinary tract infection.
2. Fungemia: The patient has yeast in his blood cultures, which could indicate a fungal infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific fungus and determine the source of infection.
3. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: This bacteremia is likely due to a line-related infection from the peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines. Continuous van"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who has a history of tracheostomy, recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), fungemia, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, found to have fungemia, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been febrile but hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of recurrent MDR PNA, recent admission with MRSA pneumonia, and current fever indicate a possible ongoing infection that could lead to sepsis.
2. Fungemia: The presence of yeast in blood cultures suggests a fungal infection in the bloodstream. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the fungemia.
3. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: This bacteremia is likely related to a line infection, specifically from the percutaneous central catheter (PICC).
4. Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI: The patient is currently on amikacin and meropenem, which are sensitive to meropenem. However, the UTI requires close monitoring, and amikacin may need to be discontinued as per ID recommendations.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened despite intravenous fluid"

   admitted from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with sepsis, found to have fungemia, Coag
   neg staph bacteremia as well as Klebsiella UTI. Pt was persistently
   febrile but Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Currently on Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), including infections caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, fungemia, and bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The patient has also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer.

The patient's current treatment includes vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. His vital signs show a fever of 101.5°F, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on assist-control ventilation due to acute mental status changes.

The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL, likely due to dehydration from fevers and UTI. His urine output has decreased, and he is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus. The patient's blood cultures have grown yeast, and further speciation is pending. He also has a history of chronic anemia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on admission. His other medical"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mr [**Known lastname 2919**] is now off pressors and has
   peripheraIV access for admnistration of all ABx including caspofungin.
   he appears uncomfortable but not in respiratory distress on AC
   ventilation. he has severe tenderness in RUE at shoulder and hand
   Exam notable for Tm  of 101. BP116/66  HR 100 RR 14-16 with sats of
   99% on 40% and Ac ventilation . he has developing edema pill rolling
   tremor in keeping with advanced PD.
   Labs notable for WBC 10.9 K, HCT of 24 , K+ of 4.5 , Cr  of 3.9 ( 3.4.
   CXR with diffuse ASD, effusions ( loculated) and cardiomegaly .Blood Cx
   of [**2-17**] also with yeast
   Agree with plan to continue Abx per ID recs. He will need repeat TEE
   and head CT when stable to help with overall discussion regarding
   prognosis since it appears he will be unlikely to clear bacteremia and
   fungemia with known vegetation. he is not considered a candidate for
   valvular surgery given severe comorbidity. HD will likely not help
   given infection issues and problems with ongoing fungemia which will
   make access severely problem[**Name (NI) 555**].
   he remains a full code at present but we will need to address this with
   PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2576**] and the family at the meeting on [**2-21**]
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas and acinetobacter multi-drug resistant pneumonia, sepsis, fungemia, and coagulase-negative staph bacteremia. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a fever and has been treated with various antibiotics. The patient has chronic renal failure and is on renal dosing of medications. He also has a history of anemia, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and nutrition issues. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, right brachial deep vein thrombosis, and possible delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia and endocarditis. His current fever and positive blood cultures indicate ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Fungemia: The patient has evidence of fungemia, with yeast identified in his blood cultures. This could potentially spread to other organs and systems if not treated appropriately.
3. Coagulase-negative staph bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which is likely related to a central line infection. This could lead to further complications such as sepsis if not treated effectively.
4. Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), endocarditis, and recent MRSA pneumonia. He has been admitted multiple times and is currently in the ICU with sepsis, fungemia, coagulase-negative staph bacteremia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The patient's current treatment includes vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, avoid the need for vasopressors, and continue monitoring for any signs of infection. The source of the fungemia is unclear, but it is likely related to the urinary tract or the percutaneous internal jugular central line (PICC).

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and a previous episode of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) from colistin. His creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. He is currently receiving IV fluids (IVF) and medications are being dosed based on his renal function.

Other medical conditions include Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, anemia, and hypertension. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's family meeting is planned for tomorrow to discuss further management and potential options such as hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), including infections with Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with sepsis and was found to have fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, as well as a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. His renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 4.1. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent MDR PNA and recent MRSA pneumonia. He is currently febrile and has positive blood cultures for yeast (presumably Candida albicans) and coag-negative Staphylococcus. This suggests ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 1.5 to >4.0, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to dehydration from fevers/UTI or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient also has pyuria without bacteria on urine analysis, suggesting AIN or pyonephritis. Electrolyte abnormalities such as elevated potassium and phosphate are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history and current conditions. The patient has multiple drug-resistant infections, including ESBL Klebsiella, MRSA, VRE, and colonization with acinetobacter. He also has tracheostomy, fungemia, and coag-negative staph bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 110/58 to 140/77 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate worsening renal function with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL. Other lab values show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals tremulousness due to Parkinson's disease, pain on hand movement, tracheostomy in place, cardiovascular abnormalities, and respiratory chest findings. Neurological examination was not performed.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing current antibiotics for coag-negative staph bacteremia, Klebsiella UTI, and candidemia. Renal consultation is recommended for potential hemodialysis, and management of hand pain and delirium is also planned. The patient is receiving proper"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple drug-resistant infections, including ESBL Klebsiella, MRSA, VRE, and colonization with Acinetobacter. The patient is currently experiencing worsening renal function, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia, [Last Name] for Klebsiella UTI, and caspofungin for candidemia. Surveillance cultures are being continued, and the patient has peripherals IV only.

The patient requires an ophthalmic evaluation, and a cardiology consult is recommended for a TEE to assess prognosis. Daily EKG checks are also advised. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with increasing creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Renal consultation is suggested if the family agrees to hemodialysis. A phosphate binder should be managed medically.

The patient is experiencing hand pain, which may be related to potential contractures. An occupational therapy consult is recommended, along with an X-ray of the hand. Septic joint is not suspected at this time, but careful observation is needed.

The patient's delirium is being managed medically. ICU care includes repletion with fiber and a nutrition consult. Glycemic control is being maintained through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines"

   67 yom s/p tracheostomy, h/o Pseudomonas/Acineterbacter MDR PNA who is
   admitted from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with sepsis, found to have fungemia, Coag
   neg staph bacteremia as well as Klebsiella UTI. Pt was persistently
   febrile but Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Currently on Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.
   Amikacin DC
d [**2-20**].
   - cont Vanco
   - will change caspo to fluconazole as [**Female First Name (un) 474**] is responsive to
   fluconazole and pt has ARF
   - will dicontinue meropenem as patient has completed course for UTI
   - Goal MAP >65
   - No pressor requirement at this time, responsive to IVF, family does
   not want to start pressors
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now rising to > 4.0, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from
   fevers/UTI vs AIN.   Has pyuria without bacteria on UA, suggesting AIN
   or pyonephritis.  Now also with electrolyte abnormalities
 elevated K
   and phos.
   -- monitor Is and Os
   -- trend Creatinine
   -- IVF bolus PRN
   - Renally dose meds
   - kayexalate prn, phosphate binder
   - pt not likely candidate for initiation of HD, discuss at family
   meeting planned for today
   .
   #. Fungemia
 unclear source at this time but urine vs PICC most
   likely.   Renal U/S negative for evidence of abscess.
   - 2/11&[**2-17**] blood cultures growing C.albicans
   - will switch caspofungin to fluconazole as above
   - family to decide whether to go ahead with TEE given high risk
   procedure with his low BP and parkinsonian tremors
   .
   # Coagulase negative staph bacteremia
 Likely line related infection
   from PICC.
   - Continue Vancomycin dosed by level (goal trough 15-20)
   - follow surveillance cultures
   - all central lines DC
   .
   # Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI - (ESBL +) subsequent urine cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who has a history of pseudomonas/acineterbacter multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), sepsis, fungemia, coag negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent MDR PNA, recent admission with MRSA PNA, and ongoing infections. He is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. There is a concern for ongoing sepsis due to the presence of fever and positive blood cultures.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and worsening renal function. His creatinine levels are elevated, and he has electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Close monitoring of intake and output, trend creatinine, and administering IV fluids as needed are recommended.
3. Fungemia: The patient has positive blood cultures for Candida albicans, and the source of infection is unclear. Switching from caspofungin to fluconazole is advised, and further investigation is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to several medications and has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and caspofungin. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Fluid balance indicates significant fluid intake and output imbalances. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, with set tidal volume (Vt) at 550 mL and respiratory support rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and neurologic examination is also not performed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), and abnormal kidney function tests (Cr). Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values indicate possible metabolic abnormalities.

Plan:
- Continue ICU care with focus on renal support and monitoring.
- Administer kayexalate and sevelamer for renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
- Discontinue fondaparinux due to worsening renal failure.
- Aseptic pyuria with nearly 300 WBCs observed.
- No pressors or dialysis considered at this time.
- Family to continue discussing care modifications (CMO) without antibiotics.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who has a history of pseudomonas/acineterbacter multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), as well as a history of endocarditis. The patient was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with sepsis, found to have fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was persistently febrile but hemodynamically stable.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level rising from 1.5 to >4.0, likely due to dehydration from fevers/UTI versus acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient also has pyuria without bacteria on urine analysis, suggesting AIN or pyonephritis. Electrolyte abnormalities, including elevated potassium and phosphate, are present.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, with an initial improvement in creatinine to 1.5 but subsequent worsening. The source of fungemia is unclear at this time but is likely related to the urinary tract or the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC). Renal ultrasound did not show evidence of abscess.

The patient has bacteremia with coag-negative staph, likely due to a line-related infection. All central lines should"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas/acetabular MRSA pneumonia, endocarditis, and chronic renal failure.
- The patient has been admitted multiple times with various infections, including sepsis, fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's recent admission was due to fever, and blood cultures revealed yeast (preliminary Candida albicans) and coag-negative Staph. Urine cultures showed Klebsiella.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of >4.0 mg/dL. The cause is likely dehydration from fevers/UTI or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to colistin.
- The patient also has electrolyte abnormalities, including elevated potassium and phosphate levels.
- A renal ultrasound was negative for evidence of abscess, and there is uncertainty about the source of fungemia, possibly from the PICC line.
- The patient's tracheostomy was placed two months ago, and he has been on assist-control ventilation due to altered mental status.
- The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ESBL Kleb, MRSA, VRE, and acinetobacter colonization. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure. He has multiple antibiotic-resistant infections including coag-neg staph bacteremia, Klebsiella UTI, and candidemia. The patient's condition is critically ill, and he has a DNR (do not resuscitate) order with no dialysis or pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Persistent hypotension leading to organ hypoperfusion and potential shock.
3. Unknown origin fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection or systemic inflammatory response.
4. Altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, or medication effects.
5. Chronic respiratory failure, requiring ongoing ventilatory support.
6. Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Potential complications from central venous catheters, such as thrombosis or infection.
8. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous access.
9. Possible complications related to renal feeds, such as aspiration pneumonia or inadequate nutrition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), including infections caused by Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, MRSA, and Klebsiella. The patient presented to the ICU with sepsis, fungemia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). He has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. Currently, the patient's condition remains unstable with persistent fevers and hypotension unresponsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of recurrent MDR PNA and recent readmission with fever suggest ongoing sepsis. The patient's hypotension and persistent fevers indicate that sepsis may still be present despite previous antibiotic treatments.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a confirmed infection with Candida albicans, a type of yeast. The source of the fungemia is unclear, but it could be related to a urinary tract infection or a central line infection. 
3. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: This bacteremia is likely related to a line infection, possibly from a PICC line.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have risen significantly, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to dehydration from fevers"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has received various antibiotics and antifungal treatments. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure in the 80's and unresponsiveness to intravenous fluids. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other physical examination findings. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

2. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. It may be unresponsive to intravenous fluids, suggesting possible cardiac or vascular issues.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever without a known source could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response. This can complicate the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors,"

   admitted from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with sepsis, found to have fungemia, Coag
   neg staph bacteremia as well as Klebsiella UTI. Pt was persistently
   febrile but Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Currently on Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.
   Amikacin DC

   - cont Vanco
   - will change caspo to fluconazole as [**Female First Name (un) 474**] is responsive to
   fluconazole and pt has ARF
   - will dicontinue meropenem as patient has completed course for UTI
   - Goal MAP >65
   - No pressor requirement at this time, responsive to IVF, family does
   not want to start pressors
   - appreciate ID recs

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now rising to > 4.0, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from
   fevers/UTI vs AIN.   Has pyuria without bacteria on UA, suggesting AIN
   or pyonephritis.  Now also with electrolyte abnormalities
 elevated K

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), endocarditis, and various infections caused by different organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, MRSA, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, fungemia (likely due to Candida albicans), bacteremia with Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (likely line-related infection), and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient's renal function has deteriorated significantly, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.5 to >4.0.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and line-related infection, switching caspofungin to fluconazole for candidemia, discontinuing meropenem since the UTI has cleared, and monitoring for any signs of infection. Renal dosing of medications, IV fluid boluses as needed, and the use of medications such as kayexalate and phosphate binders are also recommended due to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure.

Other medical issues mentioned in the note include Parkinson's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ESBL Kleb, MRSA, VRE, and acinetobacter colonization. He is currently intubated and has fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella UTI. The patient is experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella UTI. These infections can worsen the patient's condition and may lead to sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on the ventilator and is growing pseudomonas in the bronchoalveolar lavage. This indicates a possible worsening of respiratory function and an increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.0 mg/dL. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and delirium, which can be multifactorial due to renal failure, infection, and underlying Parkinson's disease.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a brachial DVT, which may not be receiving appropriate treatment since it"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ESBL Kleb, MRSA, VRE, acinetobacter colonization, tracheostomy, fungemia, and coag-negative staph bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications including renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 92/60 mmHg to 101/66 mmHg, heart rate between 72-90 bpm, respiratory rate between 14-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures show the presence of hyphae. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium and low bicarbonate levels. Other lab results, including liver enzymes and kidney function tests, are mostly within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes colonization with multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria and previous infections. The patient's current medications include fluconazole, morphine, Ativan, lantus, and a proton pump inhibitor"

   Cr had improved to 1.5 then rose to > 4.0, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from
   fevers/UTI vs AIN.   Transiently had pyuria without bacteria on UA, but
   has yeast now.  His ARF may be secondary to AIN or ATN or
   pyonephritis.  Renal US without abscess or obstruction.  Now also with

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas/acetabular mixed drug-resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, fungemia, coagulase-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's medical history includes recurrent MDR PNA, endocarditis, recent MRSA pneumonia treated with vancomycin, and a history of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) from colistin. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute on chronic renal failure (ARF), with creatinine levels rising to >4.0. The cause of ARF may be secondary to AIN or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pyelonephritis. Renal ultrasound (US) did not reveal any abscess or obstruction.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring assistance with ventilation due to acute mental status changes (AMS) in the setting of infection. He has been on a tracheostomy for 2 months and previously used a tracheal mask at the rehabilitation facility.

Other notable medical conditions include Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and nutrition support. The patient also has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and renal failure,"

   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Initially treated with
   Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.  Amikacin DC

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), fungemia, coagulase-negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been febrile but hemodynamically stable. He has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for MRSA PNA and is now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures show yeast (preliminary Candida albicans) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Urine cultures show Klebsiella. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent MDR PNA and recent MRSA PNA. He is febrile, and there is an ongoing infection.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. This may be due to dehydration, urinary tract infection, acute tubular necrosis, or pyelonephritis.
3. Fungemia: The patient has yeast in his blood cultures, which could indicate a systemic fungal infection.
4. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus Bacteremia: The patient has an infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, likely from a central line.

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on fluconazole indefinitely, with weekly LFT checks. He has a history of allergies to certain medications and has received antibiotics in the past. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a sinus rhythm with fluctuating blood pressures. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,620 mL and output of 1,870 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with assist/support mode, using a tracheostomy tube, and receiving morphine for pain management. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low calcium and magnesium. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of pseudomonas/acetabular MRSA pneumonia, sepsis, fungemia, coag-neg staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, found to have fungemia, coag-neg staph bacteremia, as well as Klebsiella UTI.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant PNA (pneumonia) as well as a history of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA pneumonia, completed a 14-day course of vancomycin, and now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures show yeast (preliminary Candida albicans) and coag-neg staph. Initially treated with Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin. Amikacin discontinued on 2/20. Vanc discontinued due to surveillance cultures negative for CNS (central nervous system), and caspo changed to fluconazole as the patient is responsive to fluconazole and has acute renal failure (ARF). Will discontinue meropenem as the patient has completed the course for UTI (urinary tract infection).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with disseminated fungemia requiring fluconazole for life, who is critically ill. He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been tolerating intermittent pressure support ventilation (PSV). His creatinine level is stable at 3.9, and he is producing good urine output. Electrolyte imbalances need to be monitored, and no dialysis has been planned per family discussion. The patient is also experiencing tremors, rigidity, and pain, for which morphine and Ativan are being given as needed. He has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected by giving free water through the feeding tube. The patient's delirium is multifactorial, resulting from renal failure, infection, and underlying Parkinson's disease. There is a suspicion of right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it is not being treated since it is distal and associated with the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure needs to be managed carefully to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, pseudomonas/acineterbacter multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), and previous endocarditis. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is febrile but hemodynamically stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent MDR PNA and recent admission with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He completed a 14-day course of vancomycin but was readmitted with fever. Blood cultures show yeast (preliminary Candida albicans) and coag-negative staph. He was initially treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin. Amikacin was discontinued on February 20th. Vancomycin was discontinued due to surveillance cultures being negative for central nervous system (CNS) infection. Caspofungin was changed to fluconazole as the patient is responsive to fluconazole, and he has acute renal failure (ARF). Meropenem was discontinued since the patient has completed the course for UTI. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg, and family does not want"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who has undergone tracheostomy and has had multiple recurrent multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, including coag-negative staph bacteremia, Klebsiella UTI, and now fungemia. The patient also has chronic renal failure, which is acute on chronic, and is thought to be medication-related rather than due to sepsis. The family does not want the patient to undergo hemodialysis. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and is on medication for it. He has poor mental status but it is not acute. The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for feeding and a brachial clot at the site of an old peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which is not being treated due to a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient has do not resuscitate (DNR) status and is in the ICU with boots, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and two peripheral IV lines. The patient is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fungemia: The patient currently has fungemia, which could lead to further systemic infection and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating,"

   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Initially treated with
   Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.  Amikacin DC

   - Vanc discontinued as surveillance cultures negative for CNS
   - changed caspo to fluconazole as [**Female First Name (un) 474**] is responsive to fluconazole
   and pt has ARF
   - discontinued meropenem as patient has completed course for UTI

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, recurrent multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia, MRSA pneumonia, fungemia caused by Candida albicans, bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic renal failure, delirium, respiratory failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and malnutrition. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia and bacteremia, indicating a high risk for sepsis. The presence of fever and positive blood cultures suggests ongoing infection.
2. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia caused by Candida albicans. This indicates a systemic fungal infection that requires prompt treatment.
3. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, likely due to a central line infection. This requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.
4. Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is an ESBL-producing strain"

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple drug-resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), including infections caused by Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, MRSA, Klebsiella, and Candida. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for severe infections and has a history of endocarditis. 

The patient's current presentation includes fever, sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, fungemia, bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. The source of fungemia is unclear but may be related to a urinary catheter or PICC line. 

The patient has a history of amikacin and colistin-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal ultrasound did not show any abscess or obstruction. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungals, including vancomycin, meropenem, caspofungin, and fluconazole. 

The patient also has a history of Parkinson's disease, delirium, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and malnutrition. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and they have declined hemodialysis (HD).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly addressed.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function, which may be due to dehydration, AIN, ATN, or pyonephritis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is essential.
3. Fungemia: The patient has yeast in the blood, which needs to be treated with appropriate antifungal therapy. Identifying the source of fungemia is crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus Bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia with this organism, likely originating from a line-related infection. Removing the central line and monitoring surveillance cultures are important.
5. Klebsiella Pneumoniae UTI: Although the patient's urine cultures have cleared, there is a risk of recurrence, especially with the presence of ESBL-producing strains. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
6. History of MDR PNA: The patient's history of multiple drug-resistant pneumonia increases the risk of recurrent infections and difficulty in finding effective antibiotic treatments.
7. Delirium: The patient's change in mental status may be attributed to infection and worsening Parkinson's disease. Monitoring cognitive function and providing appropriate care to prevent further complications is important.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring due to the need for assist control ventilation and tracheostomy.

It is important to note that the patient's complex medical history and current condition require careful management to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   #. Sepsis: The pt has a history of recurrent MDR PNA as well as history
   of endocarditis. Recent admission with MRSA PNA, completed 14 day
   course of vancomycin on [**2-12**] now readmitted with fever. Blood cultures
   with yeast (prelim- C. albicans) and Coagulase negative Staph. Urine
   cultures with Klebsiella. Initially treated with
   Vanc/Meropenem/caspofungin.  Amikacin DC

   - Vanc discontinued as surveillance cultures negative for CNS
   - changed caspo to fluconazole as [**Female First Name (un) 474**] is responsive to fluconazole
   and pt has ARF
   - discontinued meropenem as patient has completed course for UTI
   - Goal MAP >65

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now rising to > 4.0, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from
   fevers/UTI vs AIN.   Transiently had pyuria without bacteria on UA, but
   has yeast now.  His ARF may be secondary to AIN or ATN or
   pyonephritis.  Renal US without abscess or obstruction.  Now also with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), endocarditis, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted from a rehabilitation hospital with sepsis, found to have fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient has been persistently febrile but hemodynamically stable. The sepsis is likely due to the patient's history of MDR PNA, recent MRSA PNA, and current infections with yeast (Candida albicans), coag-negative staph, and Klebsiella. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin, but the treatment has been adjusted based on surveillance cultures and the patient's response. 

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with a rising creatinine level from 1.5 to >4.0, likely due to dehydration from fevers/UTI or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has electrolyte abnormalities, including elevated phosphate levels. 

There is unclear source of fungemia, with possible involvement of the urinary tract or the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC line). The coag-negative staph bacteremia is likely related to a line infection, and all central lines should be discontinued. The Klebsiella UTI"

   with sepsis, found to have fungemia, Coag neg staph bacteremia as well
   as Klebsiella UTI.
   # Respiratory Failure:  s/p tracheostomy 2 months ago.   He was
   previously on tracheal mask at rehab but now ventilator-depending in
   the setting of acute illness.   Repeat sputum culture growing
   acinetobacter and pseudomonas, both of which are known to be colonized.
   -- Trach collar trial today
   -- Albuterol/Atroven nebs PRN
   #. Fungemia
 unclear source at this time but urine vs PICC most
   likely.   Renal U/S negative for evidence of abscess.
   - 2/11&[**2-17**] blood cultures growing C.albicans.
   - fluconazole as above, as per sensitivities, with plan to treat
   indefinitely
   - f/u surveillance blood cultures
   - will not proceed with TEE after family meeting
   - Appreciate ID recs
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with history of AIN from colistin,
   Cr had improved to 1.5 now stable at ~ 4.0, likely [**2-6**] dehydration from
   fevers/UTI vs AIN.   His ARF may be secondary to AIN or ATN.  Renal US
   without abscess or obstruction.
   - monitor Is and Os
   - trend Creatinine QOD
   - Renally dose meds
   - pt not likely candidate for initiation of HD, discussed with family
   # Coagulase negative staph bacteremia
  Suspect line-infection vs.
   contamination.
   - completed vancomycin 7 day course
   - follow surveillance cultures
   - PICC discontinued immediately following positive blood cultures
   # Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI - (ESBL +) subsequent urine cultures
   cleared
   - completed meropenem 7-day course, now s/p foley exchange
   # RUE Pain
 Suspect pain is secondary to pain in the setting of
   worsening contracture.  Plain films on [**2-23**] negative for fracture or
   dislocation.   Patient did not tolerate splint placement.
   - Pain control with Dilaudid PRN

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation facility with sepsis, fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1974 mL total in, 1973 mL total out, with a net intake of 204 mL since 12 AM. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever.

The patient's physical examination reveals generalized anasarca, pain elicited with passive flexion and extension of the right wrist, cogwheeling of upper extremities, scattered rhonchi in the lungs, and masked facies. Neurological examination shows no observed purposeful movements, but the patient responds to noxious stimuli and has preserved eye-opening and blinking.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 thousand/mm³, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 3"

   from side to side, which is not the first time [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Doctor First Name 625**]. We will have

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, who has undergone a tracheostomy and has had multiple drug-resistant pneumonia infections, as well as coagulase-negative staph bacteremia and a Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
- The patient is currently experiencing fungemia and renal failure. He is on fluconazole indefinitely for the fungemia, which may be related to endocarditis.
- The patient continues to spike fevers and is being cultured periodically.
- His renal function is acute on chronic, and it is uncertain whether the renal failure is medication-related or due to sepsis.
- The family does not want the patient to undergo hemodialysis.
- The patient has a poor mental status and has a history of Parkinson's disease. He is on his regular Parkinson's medication regimen.
- The patient has a brachial clot at the site of an old PICC line, but it is not being treated. He also has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- The patient has anemia and is having blood draws reduced to every other day.
- The patient's DNR (do not resuscitate) status is being followed, and he is not to receive hemodialysis or have his care escalated.
- The patient is receiving Dilaudid for pain control due to facial grimacing.
- There are ongoing discussions between the primary team,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, multiple drug-resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), sepsis, fungemia, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute on chronic renal failure, coagulase-negative staph bacteremia, right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and malnutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, persistent bacteremia, development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE), worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms, uncontrolled diabetes, and malnutrition.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, blood cultures, fluid balance, nutritional intake, and glycemic control. Additionally, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on sensitivities, and efforts should be made to prevent further complications like VAP and DVT. Close communication with the family regarding the patient's condition and code status is crucial."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted from a rehabilitation hospital with sepsis, fungemia, coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a history of tracheostomy, acute renal failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right upper extremity. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple infections, including Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas in the sputum, C. albicans in the blood, and Klebsiella pneumoniae UTI. The patient has also had a line infection and a DVT. The patient's current medications include fluconazole for fungemia, albuterol/atropen nebs for respiratory support, pain control with Dilaudid, and other medications for various conditions. The patient's code status is DNR, and no pressors or hemodialysis will be administered after a family meeting on February 21st. The patient's family has been informed and discussed the care plan with the healthcare provider.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on respiratory support and has repeated sputum cultures growing Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, both known to be colonized. This increases the risk of further respiratory infections.
2. Fungemia: The patient has ongoing fungemia with C"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation center with sepsis, fungemia, coagulation-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been experiencing fevers and respiratory failure. He has a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation. Recent sputum cultures have grown Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, both of which are known to be colonized. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and there are concerns about acute on chronic renal failure. There is also a suspicion of a line infection with coagulation-negative Staphylococcus and a previous UTI with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which has cleared after treatment. The patient is in pain due to worsening contractures and has a right brachial deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is not being treated. Other medical conditions include Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and fen (tube feeding). The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and the family is discussing potential placement in inpatient hospice.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown age and gender, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, renal failure, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and an unknown origin of fever. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. They are receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and have multiple IV lines for medication administration. The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, with a maximum reading of 91/44 mmHg. The heart rate ranges between 73-94 bpm, respiratory rate is 15-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a maximum reading of 38.4 C (101.1 F) and a current temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F). Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium, along with low levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's recent medical history includes antibiotic use and discontinuation of severeimer. The patient's allergies include anaphylaxis to Ditropan and hives from lisinopril. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and altered mental status may suggest an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. This may be medication-related or due to sepsis. The patient's urine output needs to be monitored, and they require fluid management.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which has not responded to fluid boluses. This indicates a possible underlying issue causing poor blood pressure control. The patient's mean arterial pressure should be closely monitored.

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient continues to spike fevers despite being on antifungal medication for fungemia. It is important to periodically culture the patient to identify any new infections.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, likely due to multiple drug-resistant (MDR) pneumonias and infections. Ventilatory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

5. Altered mental status: The patient has a poor mental status, which has not improved. This could be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease.

6. Colonization with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas: The patient's sputum cultures show colonization with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. These organisms are known to cause healthcare-associated infections and can be challenging to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who has been in the ICU for multiple infections, including MDR pneumonias, a coag-negative staph bacteremia, and a Klebsiella UTI. He is now experiencing fungemia and stable renal failure. The patient's current conditions include renal failure, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, and chronic respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of multiple infections and ongoing fever suggests a high risk for sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which can result in further deterioration of renal function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis).

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's chronic respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, he is at increased risk for developing VAP. VAP can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility, history of HIT, and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE if not prevented.
