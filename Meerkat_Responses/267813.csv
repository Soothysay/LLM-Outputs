","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) presenting with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable after a syncopal episode. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is still low, and he continues to have bloody bowel movements despite using golytely. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed colitis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. He has been treated with intravenous (IV) steroids, flagyl, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and zofran for nausea. Surgical consultation is planned for tomorrow to evaluate for toxic megacolon. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's presentation with bloody bowel movements indicates ongoing lower GI bleeding. This can lead to significant blood loss, resulting in hypotension and shock.
2. Toxic megacolon: Given the patient's history of UC and ongoing bloody stools, there is a concern for toxic megacolon. This condition can be life-threatening and may require surgical intervention.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient has an inflammatory state due to UC, he is at increased risk of developing DVT. Swelling of the right knee could be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC or potentially indicative of DVT."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare, presenting with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has been transfused with 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable after a syncopal episode. The patient's blood movements are still bloody despite using golytely, and a CT abdomen/pelvis showed colitis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 to 120/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has received 2 units of PRBCs and 500 mL of normal saline, which has helped in resolving his chest pain and syncope. He tolerated oral golytely after taking 4 mg of ondansetron and did not experience any further episodes of syncope or chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's symptoms, including bloody bowel movements and colitis seen on CT, raise concern for toxic megacolon, a severe complication of UC. The plan includes monitoring for signs of toxic megacolon and performing a colonoscopy to assess the severity.
2. Lower GI Bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding necessitates continued monitoring and management. Serial hematocrit levels will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male with an unknown weight who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have toxic megacolon. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 500 mL of normal saline (NS) due to low hemoglobin levels. The patient also experienced a syncopal event without loss of consciousness (LOC) while on the commode, which resolved after being helped back to bed. Enzymes were sent, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no changes. The patient has allergies to metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. Current infusions include pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance are being closely monitored. The patient has received 1,300 mL of total input and has a positive fluid balance of 1,300 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient is on respiratory support with a SpO2 of 100%. The results of the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are as follows: [ABG results]. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments. Laboratory tests show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, along with decreased platelet count and potassium levels. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient is on full code status and disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's presentation suggests the possibility of toxic megacolon, which is a severe complication of colitis characterized by abdominal distension, systemic toxicity, and loss of bowel function.
2. Syncopal Events: The patient experienced a syncopal event without LOC while on the commode, which could be a result of low blood pressure or other cardiovascular issues.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels may increase the risk of arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may be due to dehydration or underlying renal pathology.
6. Cardiac Ischemia: Elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac muscle damage, suggesting the possibility of a recent myocardial infarction or ischemic event.
7. Colectomy: Depending on the results of the scope, the patient may require a colectomy to address the underlying cause of toxic meg"

   Sgy is following as concern for developing toxic megacolon as well as
   may need colectomy depending on results of the scope. Suggested
   starting Cipro.
   Drank 50% of golytely. Then, pt OOB to commode. Stated feeling
   nauseous. Had syncopal event without LOC. Was helped to knees by RN.
   did not hit head. Was able to be helped back into bed. Complained of
   CP. EKG done.
    -> no change from prior. Enzymes sent. 2units pRBCs and 500 mL NS
   infused with return of SBPs to120s and resolution of CP. Called GI to

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused atotal of 4 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable, but still having bloody BMs and is
   orthostatic.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 23
   - continue treatment of ulcerative colitis as below
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - Colonoscopy tomorrow given continued GI bleed and falling HCT.
   Go-lytely prep started on floor, zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following.
   .
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   - continue Asacol and enemas for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - NPO for now  except meds
   .
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   .
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.

   .
   #. Dispo: To MICU for colonoscopy tomorrow.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. He presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, characterized by bloody bowel movements. He has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable but still experiences bloody bowel movements and orthostatic hypotension. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed evidence of colitis. The patient's current medications include IV steroids, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and enemas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's ongoing bloody bowel movements indicate a persistent lower GI bleed. This condition can lead to significant blood loss, anemia, and hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and blood products are necessary.

2. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's symptoms of nausea, syncopal event, and abdominal pain may suggest the development of toxic megacolon, a severe complication of UC. Colonoscopy has been planned to assess the severity of inflammation and potential need for colectomy.

3. Colitis: The CT abdomen/pelvis findings of colitis confirm the active inflammation of the colon. This may contribute to the patient's symptoms and increase the risk of further complications such as perforation or infection.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 37-year-old male with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. However, the colonscopy findings suggest that the patient may have colonic Crohn's disease rather than UC. 

The patient presented with bloody bowel movements for the past 3-4 days and has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He is currently hemodynamically stable after experiencing a syncopal episode. His blood movements are still bloody despite using Golytely. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed colitis, and the colonscopy revealed a single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions, which is more consistent with Crohn's disease than UC.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient should be followed up with serial hemoglobin (Hct) measurements every 6 hours, and transfused to maintain a Hct of 30.
2. UC flare: The patient is currently on intravenous (IV) steroids and Flagyl for symptomatic improvement. It is noted that the underlying disease may be Crohn's disease, but this does not change the management for now.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient admitted with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 19, which is likely secondary to steroids. The healthcare team will rule out GI infections.
4. Swollen"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
- He underwent a colonoscopy which showed a single lesion in the transverse colon, more consistent with Crohn's disease rather than UC.
- The patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable.
- His hematocrit (Hct) continued to fall despite transfusion, and he responded to intravenous vitamin K for coagulopathy.
- The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitor (PPI), risperidone for nausea, and has been started on IV steroids and Flagyl for UC flare.
- He also has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19, which may be secondary to steroids, and is being evaluated for possible gastrointestinal infections.
- The patient has a swollen right knee, which could be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- His blood glucose levels are elevated, likely due to steroids, and will be monitored daily.
- The patient's chest pain is being evaluated for possible myocardial infarction (MI) or musculoskeletal (MS) issues.
- He is currently receiving ICU care, including nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. He presented with 3-4 days of bloody bowel movements and was found to have a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions, more consistent with colonic Crohn's disease rather than UC. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been decreasing despite transfusions, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate compensatory mechanisms.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including IV steroids and pantoprazole, as well as being on clear liquids. The plan includes serial Hct measurements every 6 hours, transfusion to maintain an Hct of 30, and monitoring for toxic megacolon.

Other notable findings include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19, hyperglycemia likely due to steroids, and a swollen right knee that may be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued lower GI bleed: The patient's symptoms of bloody bowel movements and the finding of a lesion in the transverse colon suggest ongoing bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss and potential"
