   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from
   OSH with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for
   acute abdomen.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Surgery wants GI to scope to provide evidence for/against
   intraluminal cause
 PUD, etc., such that if positive will proceed w/
   surgery, if negative will proceed with angiography for RP bleed
   - GI: scoping this AM
   - will discuss final management plan in coordination w/ GI and Surgery
   - continue serial abd exams
   - continue PPI gtt
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#2
   - obtain OSH records
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  No no longer hypotensive after fluid resuscitaiton
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Hct q6
   - CIS
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   .
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   .
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   .
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) **].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor once not NPO
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart heparin if no surgery planned
   -Bowel regimen on hold
   -Pain management with morphine
   .
   ACCESS: will take out R IJ from OSH,  likely need central access

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS Lyme disease who presented to the hospital with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She was transferred from another hospital due to concerns of free air in the abdomen, but this data was not available for review. Upon admission, the patient's abdomen was reported as rigid, raising concerns for an acute process, which prompted an urgent transfer for possible surgery. However, upon further evaluation, the patient's exam does not show signs of peritoneal irritation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/54 mmHg to 97/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with a temperature of 37.7°C.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 9.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests. The patient also has a diffuse maculopapular rash over her entire body, sparing the area surrounding her lips, with areas of convergence on her face and back. 

The patient's medical team is concerned about several potential complications, including abdominal pain, hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   Transfused 2 units pRBCs with appropriate bump in Hct.
   Hemmodynamically stable this morning. Unclear whether this was related
   to a perforated duodenal ulcer, course not consistent albeit some
   symptoms may be masked on steroids.  Also may have had a spontaneous
   retroperitoneal bleed on antiocoagulation for possible PE.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  In setting of acute blood loss and
   hypovolemia, responsive to blood transfusions and IVF resusitation.
   Also concerned for early sepsis, most likely source would be the
   abdomen.  Positive UA.  Now on vanco/cipro/flagyl. Had 3 sets of blood
   cultures and urine culture at the outside hospital no growth to date.
   Continue antibiotics.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE:  Unclear that she has had a PE,
   reports from the outside hospital inconsistent documenting RUL and then
   RLL embolism, now holding anticoagulation in setting of acute blood
   loss.  Awaiting outside hospital films.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Adequately controlled on
   morphine IV
 DIFFUSE RASH:  Rash seems most consistent with drug reaction related
   to CTX.  No oral lesions on exam here.  Steroids discontinued.
 CNS LYME DISEASE:  Has completed a course of CTX for presumed lyme.
 RIGHT IJ from outside hospital to be discontinued.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with multi-lumen and abdominal/pelvic CT findings suggestive of acute bleeding, possibly related to a perforated duodenal ulcer. The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF) for hypotension, but did not require any pressors. The patient reported passing gas from below, indicating the presence of bowel activity distal to the obstruction. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Vicodin (due to hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen), an unknown allergy, ceftriaxone (rash), and last doses of antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour, as well as morphine sulfate. 

On review of systems, the patient reported fatigue. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 37.7-37.5°C (99.9-99.5°F), heart rate between 82 and 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/53 to 81/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

   53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH with leukocytosis,
   abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for acute abdomen.
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Surgery wants GI to scope to provide evidence for/against
   intraluminal cause
 PUD, etc., such that if positive will proceed w/
   surgery, if negative will proceed with angiography for RP bleed
   - GI: scoping this AM
   - will discuss final management plan in coordination w/ GI and Surgery
   - continue serial abd exams
   - continue PPI gtt
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#2
   - obtain OSH records
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  No no longer hypotensive after fluid resuscitaiton
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Hct q6
   - CIS
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a medical history of CNS lyme presenting from the operating room (OSH) with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) at OSH and was on Arixtra. She also has a history of long-term antibiotic use, which may have led to a C. diff infection. The patient has received four weeks of ceftriaxone for CNS lyme, but her CSF results question the diagnosis. She has a history of neuropathy in her hand and feet, which is improving and stable. The patient has a rash that is possibly a reaction to ceftriaxone, and her anxiety is being managed with ativan and effexor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Abdomen: The patient presents with diffuse abdominal tenderness, concern for free air, and a history of rigid abdomen at OSH. This could indicate a perforated ulcer or another acute abdominal process.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be due to sepsis, bleeding, volume depletion, or toxic shock. It is crucial to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and ensure adequate urine output (UOP) above 30.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   # Abdominal pain: likely due to compression of retroperitoneal hematoma
   on celiac plexus. Appears that this may have occurred in the setting of
   falling while on fondaparinux.
   - EGD did not reveal cause of bleeding
   - Surgery has no plan for intervention
   - continue serial abd exams, serial lactates
   - continue PPI
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#3
   # Hypotension resolved. Likely due to blood loss. Now with stable hct x
   several days.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   - F/u micro
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on [**Name (NI) 5396**],  Unclear what
   precipitated this except for risk factor of being hospitalized.  No h/o
   malignancy, has been getting routine mammogram and Paps, has not had
   colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of bleeding
   - S/p IVC filter on [**3-3**]
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**], and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**] has had an IVC filter placed without difficulty and has had
   stabilization of her Hct without further transfusion. her rash appeart
   to be responding to prednisone and she still complains of abdominal
   pain. CT scan has shown significant intra-peritoneal
   bleed around duodenum and into both paracolic gutters and pelvis.
   Exam notable for Tmof 102.6 BP118/59 HR of 103 RR of 22 with sats of
   96% on 3lpm O2 . She has a diffuse maculopapular rash that appears to
   be resolving. her abdomen is still tender to touch.
    Labs notable for WBC of 10K, HCTof 28.5 , K+of 4 , Crof 0.5 , LDH of
   305, lactate of less than 2. CXR with bilateral small effusions but no
   infiltrate.
   Agree with plan to advance diet slowly as tolerated, discontinue Rt IJ
   line ( per ICU policy) and check caloric counts. She may need short
   term TPN until PO intake has improved. Prednisone will be continued
   till rash has resolved and Eos have decreased.
   IV PPI to be continued on a [**Hospital1 **] basis and she will be transitioned to a
   chair today. if she has no setback over next 24 hrs, we will consider
   transfer to surgical service on regular floor in am [**3-5**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS Lyme disease who presented to the hospital with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by CTA and had an IVC filter placed. She also has a history of bleeding, anemia secondary to blood loss, and a rash possibly due to a reaction to ceftriaxone. The patient's condition is improving, but she still complains of abdominal pain. Her vital signs are stable, and her laboratory values are within normal limits. She is currently receiving pain management, antibiotics, and other supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pain: The patient continues to experience abdominal pain, likely due to compression of the retroperitoneal hematoma on the celiac plexus. This should be managed with appropriate analgesics and monitoring.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has confirmed PE, which increases the risk of further thromboembolic events. Monitoring for signs of recurrent PE and considering anticoagulation therapy once the bleeding risk is deemed low would be important.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, along with potential transfusion if necessary, is crucial.
4. Rash: The patient has a maculopapular rash that"

   53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH with leukocytosis,
   abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for acute abdomen.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   # Abdominal pain: likely due to compression of retroperitoneal hematoma
   on celiac plexus. Appears that this may have occurred in the setting of
   falling while on fondaparinux.
   - EGD did not reveal cause of bleeding
   - Surgery has no plan for intervention
   - continue serial abd exams, serial lactates
   - continue PPI
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#3
   # Hypotension resolved. Likely due to blood loss. Now with stable hct x
   several days.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   - F/u micro
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on [**Name (NI) 5396**],  Unclear what
   precipitated this except for risk factor of being hospitalized.  No h/o
   malignancy, has been getting routine mammogram and Paps, has not had
   colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not on HRT.

   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) 744**].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor
   FEN: ADAT as no procedures planned.
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with IVC filter.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS Lyme disease who presented to the hospital with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for an acute abdomen. She also has a confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) and an uncertain precipitating factor, except for being hospitalized. There is no personal or family history of clot, and she is not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed on [**3-3**]. 

The patient received four weeks of ceftriaxone for CNS Lyme disease per her neurologist's recommendation. However, the diagnosis of CNS Lyme disease is questioned based on her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. She has a history of neuropathy in her hand and feet, which is improved and stable. 

The patient developed a rash, which is possible due to a reaction to ceftriaxone. Dermatology was consulted at OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) 744**]. Solumedrol was started and being tapered, and the rash is improving. 

The patient is currently experiencing anxiety and is being managed with ativan and effexor. She has abdominal pain likely due to compression of a retroperitoneal hematoma on the celiac plex"
