   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who underwent resection but has recurrent metastatic disease, resulting in obstruction of the remaining ureter. The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. Other medical conditions include hypertension, ileus, IVC filter placement, and anemia. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the buildup of waste products in the body.
2. Hyperkalemia: High levels of potassium in the blood can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Acidosis: A decrease in blood pH can result in organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Obstructive Uropathy: The obstruction of the remaining kidney/ureter may worsen renal function and lead to further complications.
5. Hypertension: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause damage to organs such as the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels.
6. Ileus: Bowel obstruction can lead to abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and potential infection.
7. IVC Filter Placement: Complications may include filter migration, perforation, or embolization.
8. Anemia: Severe low red blood cell count can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
9. Chest Pain:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer, who underwent resection but now has recurrent metastatic disease causing obstruction of the remaining ureter. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on hydralazine as needed. The patient also has an ileus with unclear etiology, possibly due to obstruction or adhesions, and is being evaluated by General Surgery. Additionally, the patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. He is also anemic, likely due to subclinical blood loss and underlying malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, leading to decreased urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory muscle paralysis. Close monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential to detect any changes.

3. Obstructive Uropathy: The obstruction of the remaining ureter can lead to further deterioration of renal function and potential infection. Interventional radiology with nephrostomy tube placement is planned to decompress the kidney.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with metastatic bladder cancer who has undergone cystectomy and unilateral nephrectomy. He was admitted with anemia, chest pain, and hyperkalemia. The patient's current condition includes renal failure, inability to tolerate oral intake, anemia, hyperkalemia, chest pain (resolved), hypertension, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing renal failure due to obstruction, which has improved after the placement of a nephrostomy tube. The patient needs to have labs checked for creatinine and potassium levels. The urology and renal recommendations should be followed, and a phosphate binder should be initiated when the patient resumes their diet.

2. Inability to tolerate PO: The patient is unable to tolerate oral intake, which could be due to ileus, obstruction, or intractable hiccups. It is recommended to try reglan for hiccups and consider thorazine if reglan is not effective. Clinical monitoring should continue, and the possibility of NG tube placement should be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be caused by chronic inflammation, malignancy, chemotherapy, or progressive renal failure. Active transfusion to goal >25 and trending Hct are advised. Iron supplementation should also be continued.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to renal failure and is improving. Labs should be trended for potassium levels, and it is expected to improve once renal failure is resolved.

5. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain has resolved, and there are no EKG changes suggestive of ischemia. Myocardial infarction has been ruled out with enzyme levels.

6. HTN: The patient is not tolerating home PO metoprolol, so IV metoprolol and hydralazine are being managed. The plan is to restart home antihypertensives when the patient can tolerate oral intake. The dosage of metoprolol will be increased to 75mg at [**Hospital1**].

7. h/o PE: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently off coumadin. Discussion with renal and urology teams regarding anticoagulation therapy is recommended. An IVC filter is in place.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient should have a low-phos, low-K diet when they resume eating. A phosphate binder should also be initiated when they start eating.
- Lines: The patient has an 18-gauge and a 20-gauge line.
- Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being administered.
- VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis should be considered.
- Comments: The patient's wife and healthcare providers have been informed about the patient's status. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

He is admitted with anemia, chest pain, and hyperkalemia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Renal Failure: The patient likely has obstructive uropathy, leading to renal failure. A nephrostomy tube placement has been planned by interventional radiology (IR). The patient will need a phosphate binder when he resumes his diet.

2. Inability to tolerate oral intake (PO): The patient may have ileus or obstruction, which needs to be monitored clinically. Consideration for a nasogastric (NG) tube placement may be necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with possible causes including anemia of chronic inflammation, malignancy, chemotherapy, and anemia secondary to progressive renal failure. The patient is being actively transfused to maintain a goal hematocrit (Hct) level above 25%, and iron supplementation is being continued.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is improving and is likely due to renal failure. The potassium levels are expected to improve once renal function is restored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer, who underwent resection but has now developed recurrent metastatic disease resulting in obstruction of the remaining ureter. He presented with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, obstructive uropathy, hiccups, hypertension, ileus, and a history of pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on various medications including metoprolol, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine and BUN levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which may lead to further deterioration in kidney function and the need for dialysis.
2. Obstructive Uropathy: The obstruction of the remaining right kidney/ureter can cause damage to the kidney and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels can be life-threatening if not managed properly, as it can cause cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and if not appropriately managed, it could lead to recurrent or worsening respiratory symptoms.
5. Ileus: The patient's intestinal motility is impaired, which may result in further complications such as bowel obstruction, infection, or malnutrition.
6. Hiccups: Persistent h"
