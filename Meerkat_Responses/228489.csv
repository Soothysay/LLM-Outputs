","Summary:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, depression, seizure disorder, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to IgA nephropathy, and poor access with a transhepatic hemodialysis (HD) catheter on Coumadin.
- She was admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent clipping of a visible vessel in her esophagus.
- Currently, she presents with coffee ground emesis, likely from ongoing bleeding, but is hemodynamically stable.
- Her PTT is high, and the cause is unclear.
- She has a history of respiratory failure post-tracheostomy, and tracheostomy removal is being considered once she is stable.
- She also has hypothyroidism, for which she will continue her home regimen IV and resume her medication for schizoaffective disorder/depression.
- She requires regular HD sessions due to ESRD.
- In the ICU, she is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and her glycemic control is being monitored.
- She is currently receiving nutrition through an HD line.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's ongoing coffee ground emesis suggests that there may still be active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This could lead to significant blood loss and potential shock if not managed promptly.
2. Thrombosis:"

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including schizoaffective disorder, depression, seizure disorder, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to IgA nephropathy, and very poor access with a transhepatic HD catheter on coumadin. She was admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and now presents with coffee ground emesis, likely from a bleeding vessel. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. 

The patient's blood chemistry results are difficult to interpret due to hemolysis and potential issues with the laboratory testing. The platelet count has fluctuated over the past day, ranging from 168 to 187 K/uL. The coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 27.0, which is unclear why it is elevated. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.

The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week, and her most recent session was on Friday. The plan is to contact the renal team regarding her HD schedule on [**Name (NI) 570**].

The patient also has a history of respiratory failure after tracheostomy and may consider tracheostomy removal once stable. She has a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and will continue her home regimen IV ([**2-6**] home dose). Her psychiatric medication, fluphenazine, has been held without problems, and it is planned to resume it today.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The plan is to perform a scope on [**Hospital1 570**] and transfuse as needed if the Hct level drops below 30. The lack of access at this time means that the HD line will be used if necessary.

Overall, the patient is hemodynamically stable, but there are potential complications related to her multiple medical conditions and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. These include ongoing bleeding from the esophagus, impaired kidney function, and the need for continued hemodialysis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms will be essential to manage these potential complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 37 year old female with schizoaffective d/o, depression,
   seizure d/o, ESRD from IGA nephropathy, very poor access with
   transhepatic HD catheter on coumadin admitted for UGIB.
   # UGIB:  Patient with recent hx of UGIB, found to have esophagitis and
   visible vessel in esophagus which was clipped.  Patient now represents
   with coffee ground emesis, likley from bleeding vessel.  GI has seen
   patient in the ED and recommends IR embolization, however, patient with
   no active bleeding at this time and is hemodynamically stable. Of note,
   PTT high, unclear why so high.
   - q6h HCT WNL
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], sucralfate
   - f/u GI recs -> suggested liquid only meds. no scope yesterday
   Possible scope today or tomorrow.
   - transfuse as needed if Hct <30
   - no access at this time, will use HD line if necessary
   # ESRD on HD. HD M/W/F.
   - received HD Friday
   - contact Renal re HD on [**Name (NI) 570**]
   # History of respiratory failure s/p trach.
   - consider trach removal after a bronch to see if still edematous but
   only after hemodynamically stable.
   # Hypothroidism. Continue home regimen IV ([**2-6**] home dose).
   # Schizoaffective disorder/depression: hold fluphenazine. [**Month (only) 60**] need
   anti-psychotic prn. Will only be able to take home meds if can take
   them crushed or in solution.

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with schizoaffective disorder, depression, seizure disorder, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to IGA nephropathy, and very poor access with a transhepatic HD catheter on coumadin admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She has a history of respiratory failure after tracheostomy, hypothyroidism, and ESRD requiring hemodialysis (HD) three times a week.

The patient's current condition includes recent UGIB with esophagitis and a visible vessel in the esophagus that was clipped. She presents with coffee ground emesis, likely from bleeding. The patient is not actively bleeding at this time and is hemodynamically stable. The PTT is high, but the reason for this is unclear.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Blood pressure: Not assessed
- Heart rate: Not assessed
- Respiratory rate: Not assessed
- Oxygen saturation: Not assessed

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, Right DP pulse not assessed, Left DP pulse not assessed
- Skin: Not assessed
- Neurologic: Responds to not assessed, Movement not assessed, Tone not assessed

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.1 g/dL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 32.1%
