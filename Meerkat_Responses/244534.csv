   Radiology Studies:
   [**11-3**] High resolution chest CT:
   1. Recent changes over four days documented by conventional chest
   radiographs
   indicate that at least some of the reticular and ground-glass
   abnormalities in
   the lungs, which have worsened since [**10-29**] are pulmonary edema.
   The
   progression of the same abnormalities between [**10-9**] and [**10-29**] could
   be due to some component of interstitial lung disease, which was
   clearly
   present on the earliest examination.
   2. Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension and global cardiomegaly.
   Severe
   coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Aortic valvular calcification
   of
   uncertain significance.
   3. Large thyroid cysts or nodules. Ultrasound examination recommended
   if not
   already obtained.
   For subsequent evaluation of the progression of pulmonary edema or
   interstitial lung disease, conventional radiograph should be employed
   as a
   first step.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient continued to be on non-rebreather for the better
   part of yesterday. This morning he was transitioned to a high-flow mask
   and is impoved on that. Read of high resolution chest CT yesterday was
   suspicious for pulmonary edema in setting of underlying interstitial
   lung disease, however overall picture is more consistent with an
   atypical infection or PCP in setting of his interstitial lung disease.
   Will not purse further diuresis given he overall appears euvolemic and
   had hypotension after diuresis yesterday.  We are continuing treatment
   for PCP in the setting of his elevated LDH and long-term steroid use
   and CT that could be consistent with this.  Less likely is lymphangitic
   spread of carcinoma.- Patient just completed 7 days of levofloxacin
   (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - Ordered induced sputum culture for PCP stain as well, given that the
   only negative PCP stain is from a sample that was contaminated.
   Currently patient appears too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - Initiate steroid treatment for PCP yesterday, which will also treat
   his intersitial lung disease, if this is playing role. Plan will be for
   prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 = [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days,
   then 20 mg for 11 days. Initiated [**Month/Year (2) **] IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]) for PCP
   treatment as well.
   - Initiated vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-4**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Will hold off PFTs as not likely to be helpful in setting of acute
   decompensation.
   - ICU fellow [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 955**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90**] discussed case with patient
s outpatient
   pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**] reported that the patient had
   presented several years ago and had diffuse changes on CT (ground
   glass, fibrosis). The patient was initially treated with high dose
   steroids, then quickly tapered down to maintance dose (2.5-10 mg per
   reports).  A bronchosocpy was never completed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**]
s report.
   This would likely be helpful for additional work up, but patient
   remains too tenuous to bronch at present.
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Resolved from yesterday, when there had been
   concern for infection in setting of low grade temp and leukocytosis.
   Continuing to monitor for infection (possible sources including urinary
   given foley, lung given hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - Will follow up culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also
   cover gram negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Yesterday had transient hypotension (80
s), which was
   asymptomatic. This episode was likely secondary to his diruesis after
   the lasix he received. His borderline low BP remains likely
   multifactorial with differential diagnosis including intravascularly
   depleted vs adrenal insufficiency in setting of long term steroid use
   vs diabetic autonomic dysfunction. Yesterday concern was for possibly
   brewing sepsis, but resolved today. Will consider tolerating if
   mentating, making urine, asymptomatic and MAP >55-60.
   - Goal SBP >100
   - AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril given recent creatinine bump.
   - If possible, once more stable, will consider addition of low dose
   metoprolol given recent NSTEMI if tolerated by bp
   .
   # Cholangio CA, biliary stricture - Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Follow-up as outpatient with oncology
will try to reach patient
   primary oncologist today to further discuss his prognosis to help
   further discuss goals of care and how aggressively to further work up
   and treat his pulmonary process.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team will see patient today to help guide
   recommendations for drain, appreciate assistance. Tube is in place
   mainly for imaging purposes and will be taken out in future.
   .
   # CAD/NSTEMI - NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**],
   trending down since, prior ECG changes with diffuse precordial T wave
   inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology had been following, recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   .
   # Acute diastolic CHF - Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection,
   now likely clinically euvolemic. BNP drawn with AM labs.
   - Will discuss possible trial of diuresis today, however creatinine did
   bump from 1.1 to 1.3 overnight.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Last echo as noted above.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load.
   .
   # ARF- This morning creatinine 1.3, which is a bump from yesterday
   1.1. Previously had bumpted to 1.4, likely secondary to diuresis
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   .
   # Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan - Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize, once more stable or as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   .
   # Anemia: HCT dipped down today to 25. Over last weeks to month, has
   been 26-29. Iron Studies indicative of Anemia of Chronic Disease given
   advanced ca; no evidence of acute bleeding.
   - Folate, TSH, B-12 all within normal limits.
   - Will check PM HCT to ensure it is stable.
   .
   # DM2: FSBG have been running high since last night (300
s-400
   Suspect secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection. Glargine was increased last night to 40 units.
   - Given ability to improve control while patient remains in ICU, will
   initiated insulin gtt.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and remains hypoxic despite being on a high-flow mask. His recent high-resolution chest CT showed worsening reticular and ground-glass abnormalities, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and global cardiomegaly. He also has severe coronary atherosclerotic calcification and aortic valvular calcification of uncertain significance. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is alert and awake. He has dry crackles throughout all lung fields, especially at the bases. His blood pressure is borderline low, and he has an elevated JVP. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels. He has been treated for suspected PCP infection with steroids and IV antibiotics. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved. He continues to be monitored for infection sources, including urinary, lung, and GI tract. His creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.3 overnight, potentially due to diuresis. The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 is poorly controlled. His cardiac, diabetic diet is being followed, and insulin gtt has been initiated"

   Radiology Studies:
   [**11-3**] High resolution chest CT:
   . Recent changes over four days documented by conventional chest
   radiographs
   indicate that at least some of the reticular and ground-glass
   abnormalities in
   the lungs, which have worsened since [**10-29**] are pulmonary edema.
   The
   progression of the same abnormalities between [**10-9**] and [**10-29**] could
   be due to some component of interstitial lung disease, which was
   clearly
   present on the earliest examination.
   2. Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension and global cardiomegaly.
   Severe
   coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Aortic valvular calcification
   of
   uncertain significance.
   3. Large thyroid cysts or nodules. Ultrasound examination recommended
   if not
   already obtained.
   For subsequent evaluation of the progression of pulmonary edema or
   interstitial lung disease, conventional radiograph should be employed
   as a
   first step.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient continues to be on non-rebreather for the better
   part of yesterday. High resolution chest CT yesterday was suspicious
   for pulmonary edema in setting of underlying interstitial lung disease.
   It is still likely that the cause of his hypoxia is likely
   multifactorial due to possible pulmonary infection (purlent sputum,
   fevers), ILD exacerbation in setting of prednisone being tapered, and
   acute diastolic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   He continues to appear rather euvolemic on exam. We are continuing
   treatment for PCP in the setting of his elevated LDH and long-term
   steroid use and CT that could be consistent with this.  Less likely is
   lymphangitic spread of carcinoma.- Patient just completed 7 days of
   levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - Ordered induced sputum culture for PCP stain as well, given that the
   only negative PCP stain is from a sample that was contaminated.
   Currently patient appears too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - Initiate steroid treatment for PCP yesterday, which will also treat
   his intersitial lung disease, if this is playing role. Plan will be for
   prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 = [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days,
   then 20 mg for 11 days. Initiated [**Month/Year (2) **] IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]) for PCP
   treatment as well.
   - Initiated vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-4**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Incentive Spirometry
   - Creatinine bumped since yesterday, but given CT appearance, will
   discuss trial of lasix to see if patient is able to come off
   non-rebreather
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Resolved from yesterday, when there had been
   concern for infection in setting of low grade temp and leukocytosis.
   Continuing to monitor for infection (possible sources including urinary
   given foley, lung given hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - Will follow up culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also
   cover gram negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Yesterday had transient hypotension (80
s), which was
   asymptomatic. The etiology is unclear, but could be likely be
   multifactorial with differential diagnosis including intravascularly
   depleted vs adrenal insufficiency in setting of long term steroid use
   vs diabetic autonomic dysfunction. Yesterday concern was for possibly
   brewing sepsis, but resolved today. Will consider tolerating if
   mentating, making urine, asymptomatic and MAP >55-60.
   - Goal SBP >100
   - AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**]
   - Diuresis as needed for respiratory state and tolerated by blood
   pressure.
   - Stress dose steroids given this morning given history of use and
   recent taper.
   - Holding lisinopril given recent creatinine bump.
   - If possible, once more stable, will consider addition of low dose
   metoprolol given recent NSTEMI if tolerated by bp
   .
   # Cholangio CA, biliary stricture - Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Follow-up as outpatient with oncology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team will see patient today to help guide
   recommendations for drain.
   .
   # CAD/NSTEMI - NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**],
   trending down since, prior ECG changes with diffuse precordial T wave
   inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology had been following, recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   .
   # Acute diastolic CHF - Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection,
   now likely clinically euvolemic. BNP drawn with AM labs.
   - Will discuss possible trial of diuresis today, however creatinine did
   bump from 1.1 to 1.3 overnight.
   - CXR pending from this morning.
   - Last echo as noted above.
   .
   # ARF- This morning creatinine 1.3, which is a bump from yesterday
   1.1. Previously had bumpted to 1.4, likely secondary to diuresis
   - Discussing possible additional diuresis today.
   .
   # Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan - Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize, once more stable or as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   .
   # Anemia: HCT dipped down today to 25. Over last weeks to month, has
   been 26-29. Iron Studies indicative of Anemia of Chronic Disease given
   advanced ca; no evidence of acute bleeding.
   - Folate, TSH, B-12 all within normal limits.
   - Will check PM HCT to ensure it is stable.
   .
   # DM2: FSBG have been running high since last night (300
s-400
   Suspect secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection.
   - Will plan to increase PM glargine and humalog sliding scale.
   .
   #. FEN - Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and has been on a non-rebreather mask for the better part of yesterday. The high-resolution chest CT showed worsening reticular and ground-glass abnormalities, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and global cardiomegaly. There are also severe coronary atherosclerotic calcifications and aortic valvular calcification of uncertain significance.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/57 mmHg to 135/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent development of fever and leukocytosis, which has since resolved.

The patient has been treated for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with prednisone and IV Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). He also received vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood"

   disease several years ago after presenting with hypoxia. His initial CT
   scan demonstrated ground glass opacities and fibrosis. He was started
   on a high dose of prednisone with improvement, and then quickly tapered
   down to a maintence dose (between 2.5-5 mg), more for bronchospastic

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Patient 60% face mask until this AM, when he started to
   desat, and is now on 100%. Anemia may be contributing to this hypoxia,
   will transfuse. CT chest suspicious for pulmonary edema in setting of
   ILD, but clinical picture is consistent with an atypical infection or
   PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] are treating empirically for PCP in setting of long-term steroid use
   and CT findings.  Less likely is lymphangitic spread of carcinoma.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum sample
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 = [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5
   days, then 20 mg for 11 days.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**])
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Will hold off PFTs as not likely to be helpful in setting of acute
   decompensation.
   - will transfuse for low hct.
   Anemia: Patient Hct 21.9 this am and 22.5 on repeat. Unclear etiology.
   Blood loss from unclear source, no reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - will check stook guaiac,
   - hemolysis labs
   - transfuse 1unit (recent NSTEMI)
   Fever, leukocytosis: Resolved. New Leukocytosis in setting of steroids.
   Continuing to monitor for infection (possible sources including urinary
   given foley, lung given hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - f/u culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also cover gram
   negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   Hypotension:  resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril given recent creatinine bump.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture: Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Will follow up oncology recs: re: prognosis to help further discuss
   goals of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his
   pulmonary process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology imput appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load.
   ARF: creatinine 1.2, from 1.3 yesterday.  likely secondary to diuresis
   . improving
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: FSBG have been running high since transfer up to 300-400. Suspect
   secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection. Glargine was increased last night to 40 units.
   - Given ability to improve control while patient remains in ICU, will
   initiated insulin gtt.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   # Hypoxia
 Patient continued to be on non-rebreather for the better
   part of yesterday. This morning he was transitioned to a high-flow mask
   and is impoved on that. Read of high resolution chest CT yesterday was
   suspicious for pulmonary edema in setting of underlying interstitial
   lung disease, however overall picture is more consistent with an
   atypical infection or PCP in setting of his interstitial lung disease.
   Will not purse further diuresis given he overall appears euvolemic and
   had hypotension after diuresis yesterday.  We are continuing treatment
   for PCP in the setting of his elevated LDH and long-term steroid use
   and CT that could be consistent with this.  Less likely is lymphangitic
   spread of carcinoma.- Patient just completed 7 days of levofloxacin
   (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - Ordered induced sputum culture for PCP stain as well, given that the
   only negative PCP stain is from a sample that was contaminated.
   Currently patient appears too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - Initiate steroid treatment for PCP yesterday, which will also treat
   his intersitial lung disease, if this is playing role. Plan will be for
   prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 = [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days,
   then 20 mg for 11 days. Initiated Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]) for PCP
   treatment as well.
   - Initiated vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-4**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Will hold off PFTs as not likely to be helpful in setting of acute
   decompensation.
   - ICU fellow [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 955**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90**] discussed case with patient
s outpatient
   pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**] reported that the patient had
   presented several years ago and had diffuse changes on CT (ground
   glass, fibrosis). The patient was initially treated with high dose
   steroids, then quickly tapered down to maintance dose (2.5-10 mg per
   reports).  A bronchosocpy was never completed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5568**]
s report.
   This would likely be helpful for additional work up, but patient
   remains too tenuous to bronch at present.
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Resolved from yesterday, when there had been
   concern for infection in setting of low grade temp and leukocytosis.
   Continuing to monitor for infection (possible sources including urinary
   given foley, lung given hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - Will follow up culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also
   cover gram negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   # Hypotension
 Yesterday had transient hypotension (80
s), which was
   asymptomatic. This episode was likely secondary to his diruesis after
   the lasix he received. His borderline low BP remains likely
   multifactorial with differential diagnosis including intravascularly
   depleted vs adrenal insufficiency in setting of long term steroid use
   vs diabetic autonomic dysfunction. Yesterday concern was for possibly
   brewing sepsis, but resolved today. Will consider tolerating if
   mentating, making urine, asymptomatic and MAP >55-60.
   - Goal SBP >100
   - AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril given recent creatinine bump.
   - If possible, once more stable, will consider addition of low dose
   metoprolol given recent NSTEMI if tolerated by bp
   # Cholangio CA, biliary stricture - Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Follow-up as outpatient with oncology
will try to reach patient
   primary oncologist today to further discuss his prognosis to help
   further discuss goals of care and how aggressively to further work up
   and treat his pulmonary process.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team will see patient today to help guide
   recommendations for drain, appreciate assistance. Tube is in place
   mainly for imaging purposes and will be taken out in future.
   # CAD/NSTEMI - NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**],
   trending down since, prior ECG changes with diffuse precordial T wave
   inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology had been following, recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   # Acute diastolic CHF - Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection,
   now likely clinically euvolemic. BNP drawn with AM labs.
   - Will discuss possible trial of diuresis today, however creatinine did
   bump from 1.1 to 1.3 overnight.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Last echo as noted above.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load.
   # ARF- This morning creatinine 1.3, which is a bump from yesterday
   1.1. Previously had bumpted to 1.4, likely secondary to diuresis
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   # Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan - Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize, once more stable or as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   # Anemia: HCT dipped down today to 25. Over last weeks to month, has
   been 26-29. Iron Studies indicative of Anemia of Chronic Disease given
   advanced ca; no evidence of acute bleeding.
   - Folate, TSH, B-12 all within normal limits.
   - Will check PM HCT to ensure it is stable.
   # DM2: FSBG have been running high since last night (300
s-400
   Suspect secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection. Glargine was increased last night to 40 units.
   - Given ability to improve control while patient remains in ICU, will
   initiated insulin gtt.
   #. FEN - Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o M w/ILD on prednisone, diastolic CHF, recent NSTEMI,
   unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to infection (atypical vs PCP)
   versus underlying ILD, although unclear what this underlying ILD is
   (likely IPF).
   - cont to treat broadly with vancomycin, zosyn, and bactrim
   - cont prednisone for PCP & flare of ILD
   - CHF seems unlikely as he doesn't appear volume overloaded and has
   already been diuresed without improvement
   2. Leukocytosis: Worsening since steroids were started, likely related
   to this.
   3. Hypotension:  Resolved.
   4. CHF/CAD:  Cont aspirin, statin and plavix.  On metoprolol.
   5. Elevated creatinine:  Improving.  Baseline 1.0-1.1.
   6. Anemia:  No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Baseline high 20s.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - check hemolysis labs
   - bactrim can cause marrow suppression although WBC & platelets normal
   so unlikely to be this but will follow
   7. DM:  Improved glycemic control with lantus 40 units, sliding scale.
   Restart insulin drip if glucose increases.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of poor prognosis. She received a blood transfusion and was given IV lasix, which resulted in good urine output. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/61 mmHg to 117/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on respiratory support with high flow nebulization and has an ABG reading of /29. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's condition. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures did not show any growth. The patient has been on various medications, including insulin, heparin sodium, furosemide, and piperacillin. She is on full code status and has been given pulse steroids. The patient's daughter recognizes the poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests may indicate an ongoing infection. However, blood cultures did not show any growth, which suggests the possibility of antibiotic resistance or another underlying cause.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Patient remains on 100% high-flow mask. Subjectively he feels
   his breathing has improved. Prior CT chest suspicious for pulmonary
   edema in setting of ILD, but clinical picture is consistent with an
   atypical infection or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 1204**] lack of improvement to treatment for
   hospital-acquired pneumonia and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5604**] pulse dose steroids
   yesterday to treat possible exacerbation of his interstitial lung
   disease. Will continue to monitor over next 24 hrs, as would expect
   some improvement in oxygen need if steroids are helping. No evidence of
   fluid overload on exam, continues to be negative balance for I/O
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had [**Month/Year (2) 5604**] prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Yesterday
   started methylprednisolone 250 mg IV TID for three days.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 4, was changed to PO
   yesterday to limit fluid loads.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Transfused 1 unit yesterday for low HCT, followed by lasix.
   - Biospy or bronchoscopy would be helpful to help guide diagnosis and
   management, however patient
s respiratory status is too tenuous
   currently, and bronchoscopy would likely lead to intubation, and
   concern is that patient would not be able to be extubated.
   Anemia: Improved this AM after yesterday
s transfusion. Etiology still
   remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis. Maybe hemolysis,
   bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer related.
   - Monitoring stook guaiac,
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   Leukocytosis: In setting of steroids, stable. Continuing to monitor for
   infection (possible sources including urinary given foley, lung given
   hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - f/u culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also cover gram
   negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture: Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology imput appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load.
   ARF: Resolved. Creatinine 1.1, from 1.3 yesterday, highest had been 1.4
   in setting of diuresis .
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: FSBG have been running high since transfer up to 300-400. Suspect
   secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection. FSBG was slightly low yesterday and this AM, so [**Month/Year (2) 3973**] was
   reduced to home dose of 20 units. Elevated insulin needs earlier in
   week may have been due to stress of transfer, possibly infection, but
   with increased steroid dose, this does not seen to be a problem
   currently.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] and humalog sliding scale.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Patient 60% face mask until this AM, when he started to
   desat, and is now on 100%. Anemia may be contributing to this hypoxia,
   will transfuse. CT chest suspicious for pulmonary edema in setting of
   ILD, but clinical picture is consistent with an atypical infection or
   PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] are treating empirically for PCP in setting of long-term steroid use
   and CT findings.  Less likely is lymphangitic spread of carcinoma.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum sample
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 = [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5
   days, then 20 mg for 11 days.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**])
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Will hold off PFTs as not likely to be helpful in setting of acute
   decompensation.
   - will transfuse for low hct.
   Anemia: Patient Hct 21.9 this am and 22.5 on repeat. Unclear etiology.
   Blood loss from unclear source, no reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - will check stook guaiac,
   - hemolysis labs
   - transfuse 1unit (recent NSTEMI)
   Fever, leukocytosis: Resolved. New Leukocytosis in setting of steroids.
   Continuing to monitor for infection (possible sources including urinary
   given foley, lung given hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - f/u culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also cover gram
   negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   Hypotension:  resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and a recent diagnosis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The patient has undergone several surgeries including CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node biopsy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) placement, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and feeling well but remaining hypoxic. He is currently on 100% oxygen support. The CT chest shows suspicious findings for pulmonary edema, but there are also atypical infection or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) considerations. 

The patient has been treated empirically for PCP with prednisone and Bactrim. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam have been continued for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Nebulizer therapy is being provided as needed, and attempts are being made to wean off oxygen. 

The patient's anemia is of unclear etiology, possibly due to blood loss, hemolysis, or chemotherapy-related marrow suppression. Further investigations are planned to determine the cause. 

Fever and leukocytosis have resolved, but the patient remains at risk for infection. Hypotension has also resolved, and lis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Today he feels that his breathing may be worse, which
   reflects the difficulty oxygenating him this morning (he returned to
   100% high flow mask with additional nasal cannula. Again, CHF
   exacerbation seems less likely, and patient continues to be net
   negative. Suspect this is exacerbation of his intersistial lung
   disease.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had initiated prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Currently on
   day 3 of 3 for methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 5, was changed to to limit
   fluid loads.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Biospy or bronchoscopy would be helpful to help guide diagnosis and
   management, however patient
s respiratory status is too tenuous
   currently, and bronchoscopy would likely lead to intubation, and
   concern is that patient would not be able to be extubated.
   - Patient is aware that his respiratory status may improve, but may
   also worsen.
   Anemia: Stable, received 1 unit PRBCs this week. Etiology still remains
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis. Maybe hemolysis, bactrim
   related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac,
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Will continue to monitor trend.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture: Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology imput appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load; patient continues to be net negative without any lasix.
   ARF: Resolved, creatinine stable at 1.1, highest had been 1.4 in
   setting of diuresis .
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Yesterday was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will
   continue to monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Patient remains on 100% high-flow mask. Subjectively he feels
   his breathing has improved. Prior CT chest suspicious for pulmonary
   edema in setting of ILD, but clinical picture is consistent with an
   atypical infection or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 1204**] lack of improvement to treatment for
   hospital-acquired pneumonia and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5604**] pulse dose steroids
   yesterday to treat possible exacerbation of his interstitial lung
   disease. Will continue to monitor over next 24 hrs, as would expect
   some improvement in oxygen need if steroids are helping. No evidence of
   fluid overload on exam, continues to be negative balance for I/O
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had [**Month/Year (2) 5604**] prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Yesterday
   started methylprednisolone 250 mg IV TID for three days.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 4, was changed to PO
   yesterday to limit fluid loads.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn today for hospital acquired PNA (day 1
   = [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Transfused 1 unit yesterday for low HCT, followed by lasix.
   - Biospy or bronchoscopy would be helpful to help guide diagnosis and
   management, however patient
s respiratory status is too tenuous
   currently, and bronchoscopy would likely lead to intubation, and
   concern is that patient would not be able to be extubated.
   Anemia: Improved this AM after yesterday
s transfusion. Etiology still
   remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis. Maybe hemolysis,
   bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer related.
   - Monitoring stook guaiac,
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   Leukocytosis: In setting of steroids, stable. Continuing to monitor for
   infection (possible sources including urinary given foley, lung given
   hypoxia, and GI given percutaneous drain).
   - f/u culture data, antibiotics as noted above should also cover gram
   negative pathogens from GU/GI tract.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture: Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology imput appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load.
   ARF: Resolved. Creatinine 1.1, from 1.3 yesterday, highest had been 1.4
   in setting of diuresis .
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: FSBG have been running high since transfer up to 300-400. Suspect
   secondary to increased steroid dose, also possibly related to
   infection. FSBG was slightly low yesterday and this AM, so [**Month/Year (2) 3973**] was
   reduced to home dose of 20 units. Elevated insulin needs earlier in
   week may have been due to stress of transfer, possibly infection, but
   with increased steroid dose, this does not seen to be a problem
   currently.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] and humalog sliding scale.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, feeling well but
   remaining hypoxic.
   Hypoxia:  Today he feels that his breathing may be worse, which
   reflects the difficulty oxygenating him this morning (he returned to
   100% high flow mask with additional nasal cannula. Again, CHF
   exacerbation seems less likely, and patient continues to be net
   negative. Suspect this is exacerbation of his intersistial lung
   disease.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had initiated prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Currently on
   day 3 of 3 for methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 5, was changed to to limit
   fluid loads.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >92%
   - Biospy or bronchoscopy would be helpful to help guide diagnosis and
   management, however patient
s respiratory status is too tenuous
   currently, and bronchoscopy would likely lead to intubation, and
   concern is that patient would not be able to be extubated.
   - Patient is aware that his respiratory status may improve, but may
   also worsen.
   Anemia: Stable, received 1 unit PRBCs this week. Etiology still remains
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis. Maybe hemolysis, bactrim
   related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac,
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Will continue to monitor trend.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture: Curative surgery not possible,
   reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**Month (only) 705**]
   [**2138**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology imput appreciated: recommended medical management ([**Month/Year (2) 369**],
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, [**Month/Year (2) **], holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - CXR overall unchanged.
   - Attempting to see if possible to concentrate medications to lessen
   IVF load; patient continues to be net negative without any lasix.
   ARF: Resolved, creatinine stable at 1.1, highest had been 1.4 in
   setting of diuresis .
   - Will continue to follow trend.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Yesterday was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will
   continue to monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently on high-flow mask oxygen. The patient's breathing difficulty may be worsening, reflecting oxygenation issues. His respiratory status has been improving but remains tenuous. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of interstitial lung disease: The patient's worsening respiratory status and difficulty oxygenating may indicate an exacerbation of his pre-existing interstitial lung disease.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia. This could be due to his prolonged ICU stay and immunocompromised state.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and a recent NSTEMI. His current hypotension and fluid overload may suggest cardiac involvement.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia remains unresolved, and further investigation is needed to determine the etiology.
5. Hemolysis: There is suspicion of hemolysis, possibly related to Bactrim use or cancer-related causes. Monitoring stool guaiac and hemolysis labs is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, with persistent
   and slightly worsening hypoxia.
   Hypoxia No significant change. The pulse dose steroids have no
   appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing. Overall
   picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his pulmonary
   fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had initiated prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Currently
   completing tail end of day 3 of 3 for methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID.
   Will remain on high dose steroids for at least one more day (today is
   day 6 total of steroids), then transition to 60 mg PO prednisone
   tomorrow.
   - Bactrim IV (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 6, was changed to to limit
   fluid loads.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), to complete a seven day course (day 6 today).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - If patient permits, consider low dose morphine or other [**Doctor Last Name **] if
   worsening dypsnea does not respond to other treatments to make patient
   more comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis, will discuss initiating hep gtt
   as well (check d-dimer to see if this is elevated, as heparin may be
   more beneficial in that case).
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing.
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs this week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Will continue to monitor trend.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management ([**Month/Year (2) 369**],
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, [**Month/Year (2) **], holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has been experiencing persistent and slightly worsening hypoxia. The patient's current medications include insulin, methylprednisolone, heparin sodium, metoprolol, simvastatin, senna, Tylenol, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has worsening consolidation on chest x-ray and is at risk for aspiration due to his inability to protect his airway.
2. Pulmonary fibrosis exacerbation: The patient's symptoms may be consistent with an exacerbation of his underlying interstitial lung disease.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing hospital-acquired pneumonia due to prolonged ICU stay and exposure to healthcare settings.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheter use.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's diabetes management needs close monitoring to prevent DKA.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic CHF puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia or infarction.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia etiology remains unclear and requires further investigation.
8. Hemolysis: The patient's bloody stool or emesis could indicate hemolysis, possibly related to bactrim use or cancer-related.
9. Hypotension: The patient's recent hypotension may be related to diuresis or medication effects.
10. Biliary strictures: The patient's history of cholangiocarcinoma and biliary reconstruction requires ongoing monitoring for complications related to biliary strictures.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of poorly characterized interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, which has improved but worsens when lying down. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. The patient is awake and alert, speaking in full sentences. Physical examination reveals crackles in the left greater than right lung fields, cool and dry skin, and interactive with appropriate orientation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, cardiac markers, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits.

Microbiology tests reveal a negative urine legionella antigen and pending results for sputum and urine cultures. Imaging studies show worsening consolidation or aspiration on chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's main concerns include respiratory failure, CHF/CAD, elevated creatinine, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and cholangiocarcinoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia this week and is likely suffering from ILD, possibly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The recent respiratory failure may indicate a progression of the underlying lung disease. Continuous monitoring and oxygen support will be necessary to manage the patient's respiratory status.
2. CHF/CAD: The patient has diastolic CHF and a history of NSTEMI. These conditions increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart attack or heart failure exacerbation. The patient is already on aspirin, statin, and Plavix for CAD management, and metoprolol for heart rate control. Gentle diuresis will be attempted today, and ACE inhibitors may be considered once the creatinine levels improve.
3. Elevated Creatinine: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Further investigation into the cause of kidney"

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, which has improved. However, he is now reporting worse dyspnea when lying down. His oxygen saturation (SaO2) is in the mid-80s on nasal cannula (NC) and non-rebreather mask (NRB). The chest X-ray from November 7th shows worsening consolidation or aspiration. The urine legionella antigen test returned negative. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications, including heparin sodium, ASA, MVP, pantoprazole, Zocor, metoprolol, senna, Plavix, and Zosyn.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 to 138/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on NC. The patient is on sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,890 mL and output of 1,360 mL, resulting in a balance of 530 mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, with persistent
   and slightly worsening hypoxia.
   Hypoxia: Acute episode of extreme hypxia (O2 sat 50-60s) and
   unrespiveness, resolved with improving o2 sats. The pulse dose steroids
   have no appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing.
   Overall picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his
   pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], started steroids. [**11-6**], started 3 days of methylprednisolone
   250 mg IV QID. Starting 60 mg PO prednisone daily [**11-9**].
   - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 7
   - s/p vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 = [**11-3**]),
   (day [**8-18**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - PRN 0.5mg IV morphine for worsening dypsnea to make patient more
   comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis,
   - Ddimer elevated, will hold of on initiating hep gtt for now, but will
   consider if worsens.
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing.
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs last week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - transfuse 1 unt today for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.
- He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has had multiple episodes of acute decompensation with oxygen saturation levels in the 50-60s.
- The patient received Lasix for diuresis, Mucomyst for interstitial lung disease, and a d-dimer test for possible pulmonary embolism.
- He experienced an episode of acute hypoxemia, which resolved as his oxygen saturation improved. An EKG showed STD in infero-lateral leads, and enzymes were sent for evaluation.
- The patient has been on various medications including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Bactrim, Furosemide, and Heparin.
- His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 89%.
- The patient has a history of NSTEMI, cholangiocarcinoma, biliary stricture, and reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy.
- He has been on steroids for his pulmonary fibrosis and is currently on prednisone.
- The patient's anemia is stable and mildly improved with a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.
- His hypotension has resolved,"

   appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing. Overall
   picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his pulmonary
   fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], had initiated prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg for 11 days.  Currently
   completing tail end of day 3 of 3 for methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID.
   Will remain on high dose steroids for at least one more day (today is
   day 6 total of steroids), then transition to 60 mg PO prednisone
   tomorrow.
   - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 6, was changed to PO to limit
   fluid loads.
   - discontinue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 =
   [**11-3**]), (day [**8-18**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - If patient permits, consider low dose morphine or other [**Doctor Last Name **] if
   worsening dypsnea does not respond to other treatments to make patient
   more comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis, will discuss initiating hep gtt
   as well (check d-dimer to see if this is elevated, as heparin may be
   more beneficial in that case).
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing.
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs this week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Will continue to monitor trend.
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].

   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]

   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and a recent diagnosis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has been experiencing persistent and slightly worsening hypoxia. The patient has been on high-dose steroids for his pulmonary fibrosis and is currently receiving methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID. He also has anemia that is stable and mildly improved today, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells this week. The etiology of the anemia remains unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is persistent and slightly worsening, which may indicate a worsening of his underlying pulmonary fibrosis or the development of a new respiratory condition.
2. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and has been given empiric treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
3. Hemolysis: The patient has reported bloody stool or emesis, which raises the possibility of hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and diastolic congestive heart failure. Monitoring his cardiac status and managing any complications related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The patient presented to the ICU with hypoxia and has been treated with pulse dose steroids for exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's condition has not improved significantly, and there are concerns about potential complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and worsening respiratory status may indicate a possible pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, chest X-ray, and sputum cultures will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's underlying pulmonary fibrosis and recent steroid treatment, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is crucial to identify any signs of worsening respiratory distress.

3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of diastolic congestive heart failure increases the risk of heart failure exacerbation. Close monitoring of fluid balance, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiography may be needed to assess cardiac function and manage accordingly.

4. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia and bloody stool or emesis raise the suspicion of hemolysis. Further evaluation of hemoglobin levels, blood smear"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the week, with an episode of hypoxemia associated with seizure-like activity and brief unresponsiveness. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 requirement of 89%. On examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented, but appears more uncomfortable today with diffuse rales in the lungs. The heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, but the respiratory rate is slightly elevated. 

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cholangiocarcinoma. He is currently on various medications including prednisone, furosemide, heparin, metoprolol, aspirin, statin, Plavix, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), solu-Medrol, and pantoprazole. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine level is also slightly elevated. Imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of poorly characterized interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently experiencing worsening shortness of breath and discomfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia suggests a potential exacerbation of his underlying ILD or possibly a new complication such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. CHF/CAD: The patient's CHF and coronary artery disease (CAD) may worsen due to fluid overload, decreased cardiac output, or further myocardial ischemia.
3. Elevated creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels indicate possible renal dysfunction, which could be caused by acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is low, indicating anemia. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been ordered to address this.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's glucose levels need to be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy.
6. Cholangiocarcinoma: Although the patient has unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, there is no evidence of distant spread at present. However, this malignancy may contribute to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on prednisone, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been gradually worsening this week. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and a poorly characterized ILD, with concerns for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The patient's respiratory status is likely to continue being a concern.
2. CHF/CAD: The patient has diastolic CHF and a recent NSTEMI, indicating possible underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). This increases the risk of further cardiac complications.
3. Elevated Creatinine: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, which suggests impaired renal function. This can be associated with medications, underlying conditions, or other factors.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which requires monitoring and appropriate management.
6. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, which may require further treatment planning and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, with persistent
   and slightly worsening hypoxia.
   Hypoxia: Acute episode of extreme hypxia (O2 sat 50-60s) and
   unrespiveness, resolved with improving o2 sats. The pulse dose steroids
   have no appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing.
   Overall picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his
   pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], started steroids. [**11-6**], 3 days of methylprednisolone 250 mg
   IV QID. Started 60 mg PO prednisone daily [**11-9**].
   - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 8
   - s/p vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 = [**11-3**]),
   (day [**8-18**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - PRN 0.5mg IV morphine for worsening dypsnea to make patient more
   comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis,
   - Ddimer elevated, will hold of on initiating hep gtt for now, but will
   consider if worsens.
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs last week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - transfused 1 unit [**11-10**] for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, with persistent
   and slightly worsening hypoxia.
   Hypoxia: Acute episode of extreme hypxia (O2 sat 50-60s) and
   unrespiveness, resolved with improving o2 sats. The pulse dose steroids
   have no appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing.
   Overall picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his
   pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], started steroids. [**11-6**], 3 days of methylprednisolone 250 mg
   IV QID. Started 60 mg PO prednisone daily [**11-9**].
   - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 8
   - s/p vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 = [**11-3**]),
   (day [**8-18**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - PRN 0.5mg IV morphine for worsening dypsnea to make patient more
   comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis,
   - Ddimer elevated, will hold of on initiating hep gtt for now, but will
   consider if worsens.
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs last week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - transfused 1 unit [**11-10**] for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, transferred to MICU for hypoxia, with persistent
   and slightly worsening hypoxia.
   Hypoxia: Acute episode of extreme hypxia (O2 sat 50-60s) and
   unrespiveness, resolved with improving o2 sats. The pulse dose steroids
   have no appreciably changed his oxygen requirement or breathing.
   Overall picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his
   pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples
   - Continue 3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
   - On [**11-3**], started steroids. [**11-6**], 3 days of methylprednisolone 250 mg
   IV QID. Started 60 mg PO prednisone daily [**11-9**].
   - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 8
   - s/p vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 = [**11-3**]),
   (day [**8-18**]).
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Continue attempt to wean O2, to keep sat >90%
   - Too tenuous to bronch at present.
   - PRN 0.5mg IV morphine for worsening dypsnea to make patient more
   comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, but will aim to get patient negative today to
   ensure this is not playing role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis,
   - Ddimer elevated, will hold of on initiating hep gtt for now, but will
   consider if worsens.
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing
   Anemia: Stable, mildly improved today. received 1 unit PRBCs last week.
   Etiology still remains unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] reported bloody stool or emesis.
   Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be cancer
   related.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - transfused 1 unit [**11-10**] for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Appreciate oncology input re: prognosis to help further discuss goals
   of care and how aggressively to further work up and treat his pulmonary
   process.
   - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**]
s team tube is in place mainly for imaging purposes
   and will be taken out in future. Appreciate input
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension)
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO from last
   week.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has been experiencing worsening hypoxia despite treatment. The patient's current condition includes severe shortness of breath, non-productive cough, and dry rales throughout all lung fields. He is on several medications including morphine, furosemide, heparin sodium, and others. His vital signs show a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 127/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated D-dimer levels, and other abnormalities. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, and further management is being planned. The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate), and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and oxygen saturation of 87% indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of oxygen therapy may be necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia or another infection. Continued monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M with PMH DM2, interstitial lung disease,
   diastolic CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent diagnosis of unresectable
   cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD excision, cholecystectomy, lymph node bx,
   PTC placement and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with no further
   surgical management, who remains in the MICU with worsening hypoxia
   presumably from his pulmonary fibrosis.
   Hypoxia: Patient has not improved with pulse dose steroids for IPF,
   antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and treatment for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   well as some diuresis. Overall picture still most consistent with
   exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection
   or CHF.
   - Patient s/p 7 days of levofloxacin (day 1 = [**2138-10-27**])
   - PCP negative in sputum x1, but poor sputum samples, however continue
   3 weeks of empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
          - On [**11-3**], started steroids. [**11-6**], s/p 3 days of
   methylprednisolone 250 mg IV QID. Started 60 mg PO prednisone daily
   [**11-9**].
          - Bactrim PO (day 1 = [**11-3**]), today is day 8, continue for total
   14 days.
   - s/p vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired PNA (day 1 = [**11-3**]),
   completed yesterday.
   - Continue with nebulizer tx as needed
   - Too tenuous for bronchoscopy
   - PRN 0.5mg IV morphine for worsening dypsnea to make patient more
   comfortable.
   - Do not suspect CHF, however continuing to aim for net negative
   balance in event this is playing a role.
   - Inhaled mucomist for tx of fibrosis, D-dimer elevated, but no heparin
   given risks appear to outweight benefits upon discussion with team.
   - Discussed aspiration precautions with patient, nursing
   - Family called in to discuss declining status, confirmed DNR/DNI.
   Anemia: Stable, status post 1 unit of PRBCs. No reported bloody stool
   or emesis. Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be
   cancer related. No evidence of active bleeding.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Transfused 1 unit [**11-10**] for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Outpatient follow up if respiratory status improves, no current
   management concerns.
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension) . Holding BB in setting of hypoxia to improve HR and
   oxygen delivery.
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO.
   - Goal net negative today given want to try to maximize all potential
   factors.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient if desired.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed. Holding NPH given poor PO intake.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.
   Currently with poor PO intake, but holding off on tube feeds given
   overall prognosis
if patient and family desire more aggressive care,
   will discuss NG placement and tube feeds today.

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He is currently in the MICU with worsening hypoxia, which is presumed to be due to his pulmonary fibrosis. The patient has not improved with pulse dose steroids for IPF, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). His current condition is most consistent with an exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis.

The patient has received various treatments including levofloxacin, Bactrim, vancomycin, and Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as steroids for IPF and PCP. He has also been given diuretics, nebulizer treatment, and inhaled mucomist. The patient's family has been informed about his declining status and has confirmed his do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is presumed to be due to his pulmonary fibrosis, and he has not shown improvement with previous treatments. It is recommended to continue with nebulizer treatment as needed and avoid bronchoscopy due to the tenuous nature of the procedure.
2. Anemia: The patient has stable"

   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension) . Holding BB in setting of hypoxia to improve HR and
   oxygen delivery.
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and recent diagnosis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening hypoxia presumably from his pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's hypoxia has not improved with pulse dose steroids for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The overall picture still most consistent with exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis, less likely atypical infection or CHF.

The patient has been on several medications, including levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, nebulizer treatment, and inhaled mucomist for fibrosis. The patient's D-dimer levels are elevated, but no heparin has been given due to the risks outweighing the benefits. Aspirin, low-dose beta-blocker, statin, and Plavix have been recommended for CAD/NSTEMI management. The patient is also being monitored for anemia and hypotension.

The patient's cardiac status includes a recent NSTEMI with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], and an ECG showing diffuse precordial T-wave inversion, now improved. The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection-related, now likely clinically euvolemic. No right ventricular (RV) pathology has been observed in recent echocardiograms.

Other assessments include heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan, which may require further characterization with an ultrasound as an outpatient. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 management involves switching to NPH and regular insulin due to poor oral intake. The patient's diet consists of a cardiac, diabetic diet, and electrolytes will be replenished as needed. Currently, the patient is on NRB (nonrebreather) due to episodes of dyspnea with desats to 70s, resolved without intervention. The patient's family has been informed about his declining status, and he has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis: The patient's worsening hypoxia is most consistent with an exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's respiratory status has not improved. There is a risk of developing HAP due to his prolonged ICU stay and immunocompromised state.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD/NSTEMI, and his cardiac status needs to be closely monitored for any signs of worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization and underlying risk factors.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations may indicate potential hemodynamic instability, which requires close monitoring and appropriate intervention.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, and further investigation into the cause is necessary.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient's stool guaiac has been negative thus far, there is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering his use of NSAIDs and anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and aggressive management of his respiratory status, cardiac function, thromboembolic risk, hemodynamic stability, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding are essential to prevent further complications and optimize his outcomes."

   or emesis. Maybe hemolysis, bactrim related marrow [**Last Name (LF) 5587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be
   cancer related. No evidence of active bleeding.
   - Monitoring stool guaiac (negative thus far)
   - Hemolysis labs have not been consistent with hemolysis
   - Transfused 1 unit [**11-10**] for anemia and hypoxia
   Hypotension:  Resolved. Hypotension in past has been in setting of
   diuresis. AM cortisol was 24.5 on [**11-2**], on steroids [**Hospital1 **] for above
   reasons.
   - Holding lisinopril and BB given borderline pressures.
   Cholangio CA, biliary stricture:  No changes in management. Curative
   surgery not possible, reconstruction with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy
   performed in [**2138-9-12**].
   - Outpatient follow up if respiratory status improves, no current
   management concerns.
   CAD/NSTEMI: NSTEMI at OSH with troponin peak at 0.76 on [**10-27**], prior ECG
   changes with diffuse precordial T wave inversion, now improved.
   - Cardiology input appreciated: recommended medical management (ASA,
   low-dose B-Blocker if BP tolerates, Statin, Plavix, holding ACEi given
   ARF, hypotension) . Holding BB in setting of hypoxia to improve HR and
   oxygen delivery.
   Acute diastolic CHF: Potentially NSTEMI precipitated or infection, now
   likely clinically euvolemic. No RV pathology in recent ECHO.
   - Goal net negative.
   Heterogeneous thyroid on CT scan: Consider ultrasound to further
   characterize as outpatient if desired.
   - TSH 0.51 on [**11-1**]
   DM2: Was switched to NPH and regular given lower FSBG. Will continue to
   monitor trend and adjust as needed. Holding NPH given poor PO intake.
   FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet. Will replete electrolytes as needed.
   Currently with poor PO intake, but holding off on tube feeds given
   overall prognosis
if patient and family desire more aggressive care,
   will discuss NG placement and tube feeds today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, interstitial lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia presumably due to pulmonary fibrosis. The patient has not improved with various treatments including pulse dose steroids, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). His clinical prognosis is grim, and the decision has been made to focus on comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and dependence on the non-rebreather mask suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there has been no clinical improvement, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating potential hemodynamic instability.
4. Anemia: The patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells due to stable anemia, which may be related to chronic kidney disease or cancer-related bone marrow suppression.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and malignancy.
6. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a very pleasant 79 year old male with interstitial lung
   disease, diabetes mellitus, diastolic congestive heart failure,
   coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who has
   experienced progressive detioration of his respiratory status, not
   responsive to treatment for [**Hospital 1836**] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1837**] pneumonia, diuresis,
   or pulse-dose steroids. His worsening respiratory status at this point
   is felt to be secondary to acute flare resultant decompensation from
   his pulmonary fibrosis.
   At this time, focus is on comfort measures. Based on discussion at the
   bedside with patient, family, and ICU team, we will give him morphine
   boluses every 3-5 minutes until he is more comfortable and less
   dyspneic. At that time, we will then attempt to remove the oxygen nasal
   cannula and NRB in accordance with patient
s wishes; oxygen will be
   replaced should he be more uncomfortable. Will continue morphine drip
   as well.
   Patient is DNR/DNI.
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease, diabetes mellitus, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. He has been experiencing progressive deterioration of his respiratory status despite treatment for pneumonia, diuresis, and pulse-dose steroids. His worsening respiratory status is believed to be due to an acute flare-up resulting in decompensation from his pulmonary fibrosis. The focus now is on comfort measures. The patient is receiving morphine boluses every 3-5 minutes to alleviate dyspnea and will have the oxygen nasal cannula and NRB removed according to his wishes. The patient has a Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he may experience further respiratory failure if the oxygen supply is removed.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 level is currently at 82%, indicating a decrease in oxygen saturation. Removing the oxygen supply could lead to further hypoxemia.
3. Increased pain and discomfort: Administering higher doses of morphine may cause increased sedation and potential respiratory depression.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and his tachycardia may worsen if he experiences significant discomfort or distress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a code status of DNI (do not intubate). They have been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and Bactrim. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 95 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 121/52 to 146/72 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with an SpO2 of 82%. The patient has received a total of 1,480 mL of fluids and has lost 1,234 mL of fluids. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, while glucose levels vary throughout the day. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers are also provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which indicates a possible infection. The elevated white blood cell count and increased lactic acid levels suggest ongoing inflammation or infection.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can be caused by dehydration or the effects of certain medications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is below normal at times, indicating possible hypotension. This may require further evaluation"
