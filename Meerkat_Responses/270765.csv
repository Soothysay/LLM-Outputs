","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. The patient initially presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient experienced seizure-like activity. Further evaluation with a 24-hour EEG is planned.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine showed bacteriuria and pyuria, indicating a UTI. Blood cultures are pending. A lumbar puncture (LP) is recommended to rule out bacterial/viral meningitis and evaluate cytology for malignancy.
3. Tachycardia, other: The patient has a sinus tachycardia likely due to fever and sepsis. Fever control with acetaminophen and cooling blanket, monitoring CVP, MAP, and UOP, and IVF boluses as needed are recommended.
4. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes may be post-ictal after the seizure. Further evaluation is needed, including final head CT and head MRI, considering XRT-induced"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of seizures and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been experiencing high fever, rigors, and altered mental status. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anti-seizure medication, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a high temperature, increased heart rate, and fluctuating blood pressure. He has restricted pupils, reduced strength and tone, and abnormal saccades. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by seizure activity, UTI, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of high fever, rigors, and altered mental status along with the laboratory findings of elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal kidney function tests indicate possible organ dysfunction, which may worsen if the infection or other underlying conditions are not managed appropriately.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and reduced strength and tone could be indicative of delirium, which can be associated with infections, medication effects, or other medical complications.
4. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizures and the presence of seizure activity in the ICU suggest a risk of recurrent seizures, which may require further evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological disorders, including a seizure disorder and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection (UTI), high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia, and increased blood pressure. He is somnolent and has decreased air movement in his chest. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and positive eosinophils in the urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and meningismus (neck stiffness) raise concerns for meningitis. The preliminary MRI findings of meningeal enhancement also support this possibility. Lumbar puncture (LP) has been planned to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Stroke: The patient's history of multiple meningioma resections and previous strokes puts him at risk for another cerebrovascular event. The MRI will be reviewed to assess for any new or evolving changes suggestive of a stroke.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder, and the recent seizure in the context of high-grade fever may indicate non-convulsive status epilepticus. Continuous EEG monitoring has been ordered to evaluate and manage this condition.
4. UTI: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fever"

","The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological disorders, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, radiation therapy, GammaKnife treatment, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection (UTI), high-grade fever, and a seizure. 

Upon admission, he was started on antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) and placed on a cooling blanket. His vital signs showed fever, tachycardia, and high blood pressure. The patient had a reduced level of consciousness and was somnolent, opening his eyes spontaneously but not to command. He also had decreased air movement throughout his chest and cold extremities. 

The laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and an elevated lactate level. The urine analysis was positive for infection. Imaging revealed meningeal enhancement and possible residual meningioma, with no evidence of bleeding or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). 

The patient's assessment and plan include acute mental status change due to his known seizure disorder, new seizure, and high-grade fever. He will undergo a lumbar puncture (LP) and an MRI review. The dose of Keppra will be increased, and a 24-hour EEG will be performed. The patient will continue receiving vancomycin and cefepime, with the addition of empirical tamif"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological disorders, including right temporal astrocytoma, multiple recent meningioma resections, radiation therapy, GammaKnife treatment, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection (UTI), high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with several conditions, including seizure disorder, UTI/high fever, access issue with central venous catheter (CVC) placement, pulmonary embolism (PE), sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure (ARF), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure Disorder - The patient's seizure may be related to high-grade fever and his known meningiomas, as well as previous strokes. It is important to rule out bleeding due to anticoagulation. Further imaging such as CT head with attention to the posterior fossa, and possibly an MRI and lumbar puncture (LP) should be considered.
2. UTI/High Fever - The patient's high fever may not be solely due to a UTI. Broad coverage with vancomycin and cefepime should be continued while monitoring for signs of sepsis.
3. Access - The patient's CVC placement should be evaluated for any complications. Regular monitoring and assessment of the line are necessary."

   # Acute mental status changes:  In the setting of seizures, s/p ativan
   may be post-ictal.  His CT head is w/o evidence of acute bleed and MRI
   head w/o evidence of stroke.  There is area of mild hyperenhancement
   possibly indicative of residual malignancy.  Patient also continues to
   be febrile, with rigors overnight, tachycardia, leukocytosis concerning
   for sepsis.  His urine was remarkable for bacturia/pyuria and cx
   pending.  His CXR is not evident for obvious areas of consolidation or
   infiltrates.  Blood cultures are pending. In patient w/ AMS/fevers,
   must also consider meningitis.
   - F/u final head CT and head MRI read (discuss w/ radiology XRT induced
   necrosis and infarct of Mollaret
s triangle though no evidence of
   infarct on prelim read)
   - 24 hour EEG

   not improving w/ ivfs and FeNa) vs AIN (eos seen on smear) vs ATN
   (though no muddy brown cast seen and no documented episodes of
   hypotension) vs obstruction.
   - monitor I&Os, UOP
   - trend creatinine
   - Renal US
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal consult if cr does not improve to spin urine and evaluate

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, post-radiation changes, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Mental Status Changes: The patient's altered mental status could be due to post-ictal state following seizures, or it may indicate sepsis or meningitis.

2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known history of seizure disorder. The recent seizure-like activity may be related to the underlying condition or could be a result of infection or medication.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine showed bacteriuria and pyuria, suggesting a UTI. This infection may be the likely source of fever and sepsis.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to fever, sepsis, or as a compensatory response to hypotension.

5. Sepsis/Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's high fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis raise concerns for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, post-radiation changes in the white matter, postoperative changes, and recent pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute mental status changes: Improving significantly, likely secondary to post-ictal state after seizures vs toxic-metabolic in setting of sepsis now that he is growing coag negative staph in blood. LP, MRI head unrevealing. Flu ruled out.
- Discuss w/ radiology XRT induced necrosis and infarct of Mollaret triangle though no evidence of infarct on prelim read

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with significant past medical history including left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, post-radiation changes, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is currently unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Acute mental status changes: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to post-ictal state following seizures, residual malignancy, or sepsis.

2. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures and may be experiencing another seizure episode.

3. Sepsis/Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has high fever, leukocytosis, and suspected UTI as the likely source. Blood cultures and urinalysis are pending. The patient's chest X-ray does not show any definite infiltrate, but he may be volume depleted.

4. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's rapid heart rate is likely due to fever and sepsis. His blood pressure remains stable despite aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological disorders, including a right temporal astrocytoma, multiple meningioma resections, XRT, GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, bacteremia, pulmonary embolism, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, and ongoing seizure activity. He has been treated with various medications, including Keppra, vancomycin, cefepime, meperidine, famotidine, bisacodyl, and warfarin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains febrile. His blood cultures show mixed bacteria, and his urine analysis indicates a urinary tract infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver enzymes. His imaging studies reveal a 5 mm stone in the left kidney and no hydro, as well as a nasogastric tube in the stomach and a right internal jugular vein catheter in the superior vena cava with clear lungs.

Potential medical complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder and recent seizure episode indicate a potential for recurrent seizures. It is important to continue seizure management with medications such as Keppra.
2. Bacteremia:"

1. Seizure: The patient is currently experiencing seizures, which can have various causes such as encephalopathy or infection. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's seizure activity to prevent further complications.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to symptoms like fever, urinary urgency, and frequency. If left untreated, it can progress to pyelonephritis or lead to sepsis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, indicating tachycardia. This can be a response to infection, fever, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring the patient's heart rate and addressing the cause of tachycardia is essential.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can be due to stress, medications, or inadequate insulin management. Monitoring and managing the patient's blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring the platelet count and taking appropriate measures to prevent bleeding is necessary.
6. Renal impairment: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal impairment. This can be due to various factors such as sepsis, medications, or underlying kidney disease. Monitoring the patient's renal function and addressing the underlying cause is important to prevent further deterioration.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and anticoagulation should be considered to prevent DVT formation.
8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis due to his critical condition. It is important to monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information. Additional information and clinical evaluation may be necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of neurological conditions, including right temporal astrocytoma, multiple recent meningioma resections, radiation therapy, GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with non-infectious symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizures. Upon admission, he was febrile with a temperature of 104.8 degrees Celsius. Laboratory tests revealed positive urine analysis with mixed bacteria and high white blood cell count. A lumbar puncture showed non-infected cerebrospinal fluid. An MRI scan did not reveal any acute bleed or stroke. 

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status due to his known seizure disorder and recent seizures occurring in the context of high-grade fever and known meningiomas, previous strokes. He also has bacteremia with cultures showing mixed bacteria, unclear port of entry, no known hardware or decubitus ulcers, and no old lines. His heart rate is sinus tachycardia, likely due to fever and bacteremia, which has now improved with intravenous fluids. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure with baseline creatinine levels of 0.7-0.8, which have increased to 1.4 and are improving with intravenous fluids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological disorders, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT, GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection (UTI), high-grade fever, and seizure. On admission, he had altered mental status (AMS), high-grade bacteremia, and fever. His condition has been monitored closely, with ongoing treatment for AMS, bacteremia, pulmonary embolism (PE), sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure (ARF), and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder and has experienced new seizures in the context of high-grade fever and known meningiomas. It is important to continue antiepileptic medication (Keppra) at an increased dose per neurologic recommendations.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade bacteremia with mixed bacteria, unclear port of entry, no known hardware or decubitus ulcers, and no old lines. Continuing vancomycin until sensitivities are known is advised, along with further testing such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and surveillance cultures.
3. PE: The patient had a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) for which Coumadin was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of neurological conditions, including a right temporal astrocytoma, multiple meningioma resections, radiation therapy, GammaKnife treatment, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He presented with nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing altered mental status, fever, urinary tract infection, and acute kidney injury. He is on various medications including Keppra, vancomycin, cefepime, and Tylenol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder, and the recent seizure in the context of high-grade fever increases the risk of further seizures.
2. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, and seizure, could be indicative of meningitis. Blood cultures are pending, and a lumbar puncture has been performed to rule out infection.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 0.7-0.8 to 1.4 after receiving intravenous fluids. AKI can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, infection, or nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been immobilized in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures should"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with significant medical history, including a left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, previous radiation therapy, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, and tachycardia. He was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequently became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococcus, indicating a bacterial infection in the bloodstream.
2. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient experienced seizure-like activity, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient initially had a UTI, which may have contributed to the development of bacteremia.
4. Tachycardia, other: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to fever and sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit since admission, which could be caused by dilutional anemia or underlying conditions such as infection-induced myelosuppression, drug-induced marrow suppression, drug-induced hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history significant for left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is currently unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has a growing coag negative staph infection in his blood. Blood cultures have been taken and are pending.
2. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient experienced seizure-like activity, and acute mental status changes are improving significantly, likely secondary to a post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic in the setting of sepsis.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient initially presented with a UTI, which may have led to the development of bacteremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with vomiting and acute mental status changes, leading to transfer to the MICU. Fever is ongoing, with temperatures spiking to 104.9 and higher. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, including vancomycin, cefepime, and nafcillin. An EEG has not yet been performed. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and nausea/vomiting.

Infusions include meperidine (Demerol), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and famotidine (Pepcid). Other medications were administered as well. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Vital signs show a high temperature (Tmax: 40.6 C or 105.1 F), but the current temperature is within normal range (36.8 C or 98.2 F). The patient's heart rate (HR) is within normal limits, but blood pressure (BP) is on the lower end. Respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) are within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an input of 4,279 mL and an output of 4,210 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 69 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg.

Blood tests reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with significant past medical history, including a stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then developed high fever and seizure-like activity, leading to unresponsiveness. His mental status changes are likely secondary to the post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic in the setting of sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, seizure, urinary tract infection (UTI), tachycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The source of the bacteremia is unclear, but coag-negative staph in the blood has been identified. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Prompt identification and treatment are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Organ Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to kidney failure if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of renal function and timely intervention are essential.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The significant drop in platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia, which can increase the"

   55 yo M with PMHx sig. for L cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningioms
   s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent PE on coumadin who presented
   initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, found to have a
   UTI, then become greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, now
   unresponsive w/ fevers and rigors overnight.
   .
   # Acute mental status changes:  Improving significantly, likely
   secondary to post-ictal state after seizures vs toxic-metabolic in
   setting of sepsis now that he
s growing coag neg staph in blood.  LP,
   MRI head unrevealing. Flu ruled out. Pallatal contractions noted while
   pt conversing appropriately making seizure unlikely cause of this
   contraction.
   - F/u report of 24 hour EEG
   - Continue keppra
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Anemia: Significant hct drop since admission. Likely dilutional
   however baseline is 40. Ddx includes infection induced
   myelosuppression, drug induced marrow suppression, drug induced
   hemolysis (less likely given nl LDH and TB yesterday). GI bleed
   unlikely given lack of melena or even stools, nonetheless with INR of
   1.8 on lovenox and warfarin remains a concern.
   -Check PM HCT
   -Add on Hapto, TB, LDH
   -Check Retic and RBC smear
   -Guiac all stools
   # Thrombocytopenia: Also significant and new. Just started lovenox
   yesterday. Consider infection induced myelosuppression vs HIT.
   -Continue to monitor
   -DC lovenox
   # Seizure disorder:  As above.
   - cont keppra
   - f/u 24 hour EEG
   .
   # Sepsis/Fever/Leukocytosis:  Currently hemodynamically stable aside
   from tachycardia.  Likely cause is coag negative staph in blood but
   source unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 13318**], BCx pending.    No diarrhea to suggest C. diff.
   - follow bcxs for speciation
   - Skin exam to r/o decubitus ulcer
   - Agree with adding nafcillin
   - F/u sensitivities
   - TTE
   - Continue vanc at current dose given for coag neg staph only need
   [**11-22**] trough
   - Needs vanc approval
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia:  Likely due to fever, sepsis.  BP remains stable,
   s/p aggressive IVFs.
   - control fever with standing acetaminophen, cooling blanket as
   necessary
   - monitor CVP, MAP, UOP
   - IVF boluses prn
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Slightly worse today, likely combination of AIN
   and prerenal, had been improving with IVF, suggesting most likely
   prerenal etiology. Renal U/S neg for obstruction.
   - monitor I&Os, UOP
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose all meds
   - will start to bolus with LR given sodium slowly increasing
   .
   # Recent PE:  Currently sub-therapeutic.
   - DC lovenox
   - Hold coumadin for one day

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of longstanding neurological issues, including right temporal astrocytoma, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT, and GammaKnife treatments, as well as a seizure disorder and left hemiparesis. He was admitted from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever despite receiving antibiotics, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. The source of infection is unclear, and further investigations are needed to identify the causative agent.

2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient has a known history of seizure disorder and new-onset seizures in the context of high-grade fever. These AMS could be attributed to the infection or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and follow-up with neurology are recommended.

3. Polyneuropathy: The patient's history of multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT, and GammaKnife treatments may increase the risk of developing polyneuropathy. Regular neurological assessments are advised.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of immobilization, which increases the risk of DVT. However, his INR is currently therapeutic, and anticoagulation has already been started.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of longstanding neurological issues, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, radiation therapy, GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient experienced the following medical events:

1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient had a known seizure disorder, and new seizures occurred in the context of high-grade fever, known meningiomas, and previous strokes. The patient remained febrile overnight. Urine analysis was positive, and cultures showed mixed bacteria. A lumbar puncture revealed non-infected cerebrospinal fluid. MRI scans showed no signs of acute bleeding or stroke.

The plan for AMS includes continuing Keppra at an increased dose per neurology recommendations, following up on 24-hour EEG results, and conducting further surveillance cultures.

2. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia in all four bottles of cultures, with an unclear port of entry. No known hardware or decubitus ulcers were present, and no old lines were found. The plan for bacteremia includes continuing vancomycin until sensitivities are known, conducting a tran"

","The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of longstanding neurological issues, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT and GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure.

The patient's current condition includes fever, altered mental status, and bacteremia. He is febrile to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and has a positive urine analysis culture with mixed bacteria. A lumbar puncture showed non-infected cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has rare eosinophils in his urine.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Central Nervous System Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection, possibly in the central nervous system (CNS). Further investigation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 0.7-0.8, which have now increased to 1.4. This indicates a decline in renal function, possibly due to acute kidney injury (AIN). Monitoring of creatinine and electrolyte levels should continue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 97-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and seizure. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 90/57 mmHg to 94/62 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 129 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity may indicate delirium, which is common in elderly patients with acute illness or in the ICU setting. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, complications from immobility, and prolonged length of stay.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of neurological disorders, including right temporal astrocytoma, multiple meningioma resections, radiation therapy, and seizure disorder. He was admitted from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection (UTI), high-grade fever, and seizure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for fever, altered mental status (AMS), and possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's high-grade fever indicates an infection in the body. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. AMS: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or complications from his pre-existing neurological conditions. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate interventions.
3. Possible Sepsis: The presence of high-grade fever, positive blood cultures with mixed bacteria, and bacteremia suggest the possibility of sepsis. Timely administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care are crucial in managing this condition.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder, along with new-onset seizures during his hospitalization, should be closely monitored. Adjustments in antiepileptic medication may be required to control the seizures effectively.
5. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): The patient has a history of deep vein"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with significant past medical history including a cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, previous radiation therapy, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. The patient initially presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Acute mental status changes: Worsening this morning, possibly related to post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic in the setting of sepsis now that he is growing coag-negative staph in blood. LP, MRI head unrevealing. Flu ruled out. Palatal contractions noted while pt conversing appropriately, making seizure unlikely cause of this contraction. In setting of INR of 9.6, would consider acute hemorrhage and consider a head CT.

- If no e/o recent seizure on EEG, will obtain CT head.
- Continue keppra.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history, including a stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status has worsened, making him less responsive. This could be related to a post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic disturbances in the setting of sepsis and bacteremia. Further evaluation with a lumbar puncture (LP), MRI head, and flu ruling out is recommended.
2. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR of 9.6, likely secondary to warfarin and antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. Coagulopathy is expected, but disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely given stable platelets. Vitamin K has been administered, and warfarin will be held until the INR normalizes with a goal of 2.0-3.0. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and worsening platelets is crucial.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has stabilized, but there has been a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history, including a stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute mental status changes: The patient has been experiencing significant fevers, which could be the cause of his acute mental status changes. This could be due to a post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic factors in the setting of sepsis, especially considering the growing coag-negative staph in his blood culture. An LP and MRI head have been unrevealing, ruling out other causes.

2. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) since admission. This could be due to dilutional effects, but further investigation is needed to rule out infection-induced myelosuppression, drug-induced marrow suppression, or drug-induced hemolysis.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient also has a significant and new drop in platelet count. This could be due to infection-induced myelosuppression or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with vomiting, acute mental status changes, and a possible seizure. The patient has been transferred to the MICU due to these symptoms. 

The patient's recent medical history includes an admission for flu-like symptoms and was treated with Tamiflu. They also have a history of nausea/vomiting and allergies to codeine.

The patient is currently receiving multiple IV medications including vancomycin, cefepime, and nafcillin. They are also receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) and famotidine (Pepcid) for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis, respectively.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is recorded at 96.2 kg.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 thousand/mm³, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are elevated at 169 mg/dL. The PT/INR is significantly prolonged at 80.3/9.6, suggesting impaired blood clotting. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   at the right base medially. Although this may merely be vascular in

   considered in view of the clinical history.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism. He was initially admitted with low-grade fever, vomiting, and tachycardia, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity and is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The patient's mental status changes are improving significantly, likely secondary to fevers. There is a possibility that these changes are related to a post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic in the setting of sepsis. The patient's elevated INR is likely secondary to warfarin and antibiotic interaction. DIC is highly unlikely given stable platelets.

The patient has anemia that is stabilized, but there has been a significant drop in hemoglobin since admission. The cause of the anemia could be dilutional, infection-induced myelosuppression, drug-induced marrow suppression, or drug-induced hemolysis. The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, although significant and new. It may be due to infection-induced myelosuppression or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with Kendra, and follow-up with a 24-hour EEG is recommended. The patient's sepsis/fever"

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a longstanding neurological history, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT and GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with symptoms of nausea/vomiting, urinary tract infection, high-grade fever, and seizure.

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and seizure medications. His vital signs have been monitored, and he has shown improvement in some areas but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and has a positive urine culture with mixed bacteria. This suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) or another type of infection.

2. Seizure Activity: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and has had recent seizure activity. It is important to continue monitoring for further seizures and adjust the seizure medication as needed.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, likely due to the use of Coumadin and antibiotics. This increases the risk of bleeding, so it is important to closely monitor his clotting parameters and adjust the antico"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a complicated neurological history, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT and GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU with nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, fever, and seizure. The patient has been febrile for the past 24 hours and is currently afib with a rapid ventricular response. He is on various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and seizure medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is somnolent and unresponsive. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals increased opacity in the right mid zone atelectasis and infarction. Microbiology results indicate bacterial growth in the central line and arthroconidia in the urine culture. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including active issues such as fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and potential aspiration risk. He also has thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, acute renal failure (ARF), and elevated liver enzymes. The plan includes obtaining a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out septic emboli, repeat chest X-ray given the right basilar opacity, and follow-up surveillance cultures."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of neurologic issues, including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago and multiple recent meningioma resections. The patient was admitted with nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection, fever, and seizure. He is currently in the ICU due to his critical condition.

The patient has been febrile and experiencing altered mental status (AMS) for several days. He had a seizure, which could be post-ictal or due to recurrent seizure activity. His condition has been complicated by thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, acute renal failure (AIN and prerenal), and a possible pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/80 mmHg to 152/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on multiple medications including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and supportive care.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal increased opacity in the right middle zone of the chest, suggesting atelectasis or infection. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fevers and positive cultures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, vomiting, and seizure-like activity suggests an underlying infection leading to sepsis. The change in antibiotic therapy indicates the need for broad-spectrum coverage to combat potential bacterial infection.

2. Acute mental status changes: The patient's worsening responsiveness may be related to post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic disturbances in the setting of sepsis and bacteremia. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to assess any ongoing seizure activity.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count indicates a decrease in platelets, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters is necessary.

4. Renal failure: Although the acute renal failure appears to have resolved, ongoing monitoring of renal function through trending creatinine levels is essential.

5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The"

   - treating with unasyn for 2 wk course
   - change foley
   # Acute mental status changes:  Per neuro, EEG not c/w  seizure but not
   normal. Worsening this morning, less responsive. Probably related to
   post-ictal state after seizures vs toxic-metabolic in setting of sepsis
   and bacteremia.  LP, MRI head unrevealing. Flu ruled out. Pallatal
   contractions noted while pt conversing appropriately making seizure
   unlikely cause of this contraction. In setting of INR of 9.6 would
   consider acute hemorrhage and consider a head CT.
   - Contact neuro to obtain report of 24 hour EEG,
   - If evidence of seizure then will d/w neuro re adding second AED
   - If no e/o recent seizure on EEG will obtain CT head
   - Continue keppra
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # HistoryElevated INR: Coaguloparhy likely secondary to warfarin and
   antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. DIC highly
   unlikely given stable platelets.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO ONCE given no signs of bleeding
   - Recheck INR this evening
   - Continue to hold warfarin until INR normalizes with goal 2.0-3.0.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding and for worsening platelets.
   .
   # Anemia: Stabilized however, significant hct drop since admission.
   Likely dilutional however baseline is 40. Ddx includes infection
   induced myelosuppression, drug induced marrow suppression, drug induced
   hemolysis (less likely given nl LDH and TB yesterday). GI bleed
   unlikely given lack of melena or even stools, nonetheless with
   supratherapeutic INR bleed remains a concern. Hapto, TB, LDH all wnl.
   Retic and RBC smear also wnl supporting dilutional component.
   -Guiac all stools
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, although also significant and new. Just
   started lovenox yesterday. Consider infection induced myelosuppression
   vs HIT.
   -Continue to monitor
   -Continue to hold lovenox
   # Seizure disorder:  As above.
   - cont keppra
   - f/u 24 hour EEG
   .
   # Sepsis/Fever/Leukocytosis:  Auerococcus urinae is likely a pathogen
   from his UTI that degenerated into urosepsis. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient initially presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), and then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity. The patient is now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Aerococcus UTI complicated by septicemia, treated with Unasyn for a 2-week course and changing Foley catheter.
2. Acute mental status changes: The neurologist believes that these changes are likely related to a post-ictal state after seizures rather than a toxic-metabolic cause in the setting of sepsis and bacteremia. A lumbar puncture (LP), MRI head, and flu test have been unrevealing. Pallatal contractions were noted while the patient was conversing appropriately, making seizure unlikely. An INR of 9.6 suggests considering acute hemorrhage and a head CT.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to warfarin and antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. DIC is highly unlikely given stable platelets. Vitamin K 5mg PO once has been given, and the INR will be rechecked this"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and potential complications. The patient is being treated for urosepsis, which is a type of infection that has spread throughout the body through the bloodstream. The patient's central line was removed due to coagulopathy, which is a bleeding disorder. The patient also has acute renal failure, indicating impaired kidney function. Additionally, the patient has anemia, bacteremia (bacteria in the blood), altered mental status, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and a history of seizure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway, aspiration pneumonia is a concern. This occurs when material from the mouth or stomach enters the lungs.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in their deep veins, typically in the legs. If a clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism (PE).

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Severe infection and inflammation can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, impairing oxygen exchange and causing respiratory distress.

4. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Due to the patient's sepsis and organ dysfunction, there is a risk of multiple organs failing simultaneously.

5. Clostridium difficile infection: Prolonged antibiotic"

   initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, found to have a
   UTI, then become greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, now
   unresponsive w/ fevers and rigors overnight.
   .
   # Acute mental status changes:  Worsening this morning, less
   responsive. Probably related to post-ictal state after seizures vs
   toxic-metabolic in setting of sepsis and bacteremia.  LP, MRI head
   unrevealing. Flu ruled out. Pallatal contractions noted while pt
   conversing appropriately making seizure unlikely cause of this
   contraction. In setting of INR of 9.6 would consider acute hemorrhage
   and consider a head CT.
   - Contact neuro to obtain report of 24 hour EEG,
   - If evidence of seizure then will d/w neuro re adding second AED
   - If no e/o recent seizure on EEG will obtain CT head
   - Continue keppra

   # Elevated INR: Coaguloparhy likely secondary to warfarin and
   antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. DIC highly
   unlikely given stable platelets.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO ONCE given no signs of bleeding
   - Recheck INR this evening
   - Continue to hold warfarin until INR normalizes with goal 2.0-3.0.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding and for worsening platelets.
   .
   # Anemia: Stabilized however, significant hct drop since admission.
   Likely dilutional however baseline is 40. Ddx includes infection
   induced myelosuppression, drug induced marrow suppression, drug induced
   hemolysis (less likely given nl LDH and TB yesterday). GI bleed
   unlikely given lack of melena or even stools, nonetheless with
   supratherapeutic INR bleed remains a concern. Hapto, TB, LDH all wnl.
   Retic and RBC smear also wnl supporting dilutional component.
   -Guiac all stools
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, although also significant and new. Just
   started lovenox yesterday. Consider infection induced myelosuppression

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), then became greatly febrile with seizure-like activity, now unresponsive with fevers and rigors overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status has worsened this morning, making him less responsive. This could be related to a post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic disturbances in the setting of sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 9.6, indicating a coagulopathy likely secondary to warfarin and antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely given stable platelets.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of recent PE and is currently supratherapeutic-therapeutic with an INR of 9.6. Vitamin K has been given, and warfarin has been held until the INR normalizes with a goal of 2.0-3.0. The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of bleeding"

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history of L cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 97-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient remains unable to follow commands or verbalize. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/79 mmHg to 143/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including UTI, AMS, PE, thrombocytopenia, and ARF. Antibiotics have been tailored to cover organisms associated with urinary tract infections, and the patient continues to receive prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention measures.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal no new bleeds or acute processes.

Assessment and Plan:
Active issues include suspected urinary tract infection with CNS involvement, need for TTE to rule out SBE, follow-up surveillance cultures, repeat CXR due to right basilar opacity, and ongoing monitoring for potential medical complications such as aspiration, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is described as stable"

   This telemetry continued to show an encephalopathic

   the right anterior quadrant. Occasionally, they became more rhythmic,
   but just for a few seconds at a time, not generally sufficient for a
   diagnosis of ongoing nonconvulsive seizures. At the time of the

   they were somewhat rhythmic but still not as much so on the recordings

- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history, including a left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, previous radiation therapy, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin.
- He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.
- The patient is currently being treated for an Aerococcus UTI, which is believed to have caused septicemia. His fevers have been trending down, and there is no evidence of infective endocarditis (IE) on transesophageal echocardiography (TTE) and clinical exam.
- Repeat blood cultures have shown no new growth since March 17th, and he is being treated with Unasyn for a two-week course starting on March 21st and ending on April 4th.
- Acute mental status changes are attributed to a prolonged post-ictal state in the setting of infection. His lumbar puncture (LP), MRI, and repeat head CT have been unrevealing for acute processes.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia may be secondary to medications, and he has just restarted Lovenox. Monitoring of platelet count will continue, and consideration will be given to HIT abs and stopping Lovenox if the"

   EEG [**3-22**]:
   This telemetry continued to show an encephalopathic
   background and extremely frequent epileptiform sharp wave discharges in
   the right anterior quadrant. Occasionally, they became more rhythmic,
   but just for a few seconds at a time, not generally sufficient for a
   diagnosis of ongoing nonconvulsive seizures. At the time of the
   pushbutton activation, there were much more frequent discharges, and
   they were somewhat rhythmic but still not as much so on the recordings
   of three and four days earlier.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with significant past medical history including a cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, post-radiotherapy, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are:

1. Aerococcus UTI with septicemia: The patient has been diagnosed with an Aerococcus UTI, which has the potential to lead to septicemia. He is being treated with Unasyn for a two-week course, and surveillance blood cultures will be monitored.

2. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes are believed to be secondary to a prolonged post-ictal state in the setting of infection. EEG monitoring and continued seizure medication (keppra) will be continued to manage this condition.

3. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR is secondary to warfarin and antibiotic interaction compounded by poor nutrition. It has been resolved with oral vitamin supplementation.

4. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and seizure management will continue with keppra and EEG monitoring.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recent hospitalization and multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status and was found to have a respiratory infection, which progressed to sepsis and subsequently developed acute renal failure. The patient also had a pulmonary embolism, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. There were indications of a urinary tract infection and seizure activity as well. The patient's INR was subtherapeutic, so he was restarted on coumadin and also started on lovenox. His wife expressed concern about his mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization: The patient's immobilization due to being in the ICU can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). 
2. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory infection progressing to sepsis increases the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and septic shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history including L cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, s/p XRT, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Aerococcus UTI with possible septicemia, being treated with Unasyn for a 2-week course.
2. Acute mental status changes, possibly related to post-ictal state after seizures or toxic-metabolic disturbances in the setting of sepsis and bacteremia. Further investigations such as EEG and neuro consultations are planned.
3. Elevated INR secondary to warfarin and antibiotic interaction, compounded by poor nutrition. This has been resolved with oral vitamin supplementation.
4. Seizure disorder, for which Kendra is being continued, along with ongoing EEG monitoring.
5. Sinus tachycardia, which has resolved.
6. Acute renal failure, which has resolved. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any obstruction or hydronephrosis.
7. Recent pulmonary embolism, for which the patient is being restarted on coumadin at a low dose and will undergo bridge therapy with Lovenox"

   EEG [**3-22**]:
   This telemetry continued to show an encephalopathic
   background and extremely frequent epileptiform sharp wave discharges in
   the right anterior quadrant. Occasionally, they became more rhythmic,
   but just for a few seconds at a time, not generally sufficient for a
   diagnosis of ongoing nonconvulsive seizures. At the time of the
   pushbutton activation, there were much more frequent discharges, and
   they were somewhat rhythmic but still not as much so on the recordings
   of three and four days earlier.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, radiation therapy, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. The patient presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection. He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including aerococcus urinary tract infection that may have led to septicemia, acute mental status changes, elevated INR due to warfarin and antibiotic interaction, seizure disorder, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, and recent pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current medications include coumadin, lovenox, famotidine, and Pepcid. He has been treated with antibiotics (Unasyn) for a two-week course to clear the aerococcus UTI. Surveillance blood cultures have shown no new growth to date.

The patient's neurological status has been monitored with EEG, which has shown abnormal activity but not continuous ongoing seizures. The patient's mental status changes are believed to be secondary to a prolonged post-ictal state in the setting of infection. Imaging studies such as LP, MRI, and repeat head CT have been unrevealing for acute processes.

The patient's renal failure has resolved, and there is no evidence of obstruction or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a complicated medical history including a right temporal astrocytoma from 35 years ago, multiple recent meningioma resections, XRT and GammaKnife treatments, seizure disorder, and left hemiparesis. He was admitted to the ICU with high fevers, altered mental status, and urinary tract infection. His current condition is characterized by waxing and waning alertness, coarse tremors, and no following commands. The patient has been on various medications including coumadin, famotidine, enoxaparin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic/metabolic delirium: The patient's mental status and level of alertness continue to wax and wane, suggesting a possible toxic/metabolic delirium.
2. Nosocomial infection: Despite resolution of fevers, the patient remains at risk for nosocomial infection due to his immunocompromised state. Low threshold for reassessment for infection is advised.
3. Aerococcus uti/bacteremia: The patient has an Aerococcus urinary tract infection and bacteremia, which needs to be monitored closely.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring is required.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is fluctuating, possibly due to medication effects (van"

","The patient's chief complaint is AMS (altered mental status) and sz (seizures). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events above. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 37.6 C (99.7 F), with a maximum temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F)
- Heart rate: 83 bpm, ranging from 79-99 bpm
- Blood pressure: 135/78 mmHg, with a range of 92-166/110 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute, ranging from 10-26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on room air
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,243 mL and output of 1,975 mL since 88 AM. The patient's weight is currently 96.2 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 97.3 kg.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:
- Hemoglobin: 12.3 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 9.9 K/uL
- Sodium: 137 mg/dL
- Potassium: 1.2 mg/dL
- Chloride: 24 mEq/L
- Carbon dioxide: 36.4%
- Glucose: 130 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
- Troponin T: <0.01
- Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with UTI (urinary tract infection) caused by E. coli, AMS (altered mental status) likely due to multiple factors including post-ictal state from seizures, high fevers/infection, known meningiomas, prior strokes, and underlying delirium. The patient's PE (pulmonary embolism) was attributed to immobility. The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, possibly due to medication effect. The patient's INR (international normalized ratio) was initially supratherapeutic, but has now become sub-therapeutic, and Coumadin will be restarted with close monitoring.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of UTI if not appropriately treated.
2. Development of further AMS or seizures if underlying causes are not addressed.
3. Thrombosis or bleeding due to the use of Coumadin.
4. Pulmonary complications if the patient develops further pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Continued fluid balance issues if not managed properly.
6. Potential need for further imaging or diagnostic procedures to evaluate the cause of seizures and AMS.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be complex and requires close monitoring and management of various medical issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningioma, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition has been improving, with fevers trending down, but he still experiences low-grade temperatures. There is no evidence of infective endocarditis based on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and clinical examination. Repeat blood cultures have shown no new growth since March 17th. The patient is being treated with Unasyn for a two-week course, started on March 21st. Surveillance blood cultures will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an impaired ability to protect his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring for signs of recurrent PE is important.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to a UTI. Close monitoring for any signs of sepsis recurrence is necessary.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to sepsis or other underlying causes. Monitoring kidney function and providing appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history of L cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningiomas, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism on coumadin. He presented with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a stroke, astrocytoma, meningioma, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, UTI, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, bacteremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of recent PE and is currently receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with coumadin and lovenox. However, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility and other risk factors.
3. Septic shock: Given the presence of sepsis and ongoing bacteremia, the patient is at risk for developing septic shock, characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can further worsen if not properly managed. AKI can occur due to sepsis, dehydration, or medications.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a significant past medical history of left cerebellar stroke, astrocytoma, meningioma, seizure disorder, and recent pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. He presented initially with low-grade fever, vomiting, tachycardia, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequently transferred to the ICU for fevers and seizure activity.

Impressions:
1. Right basilar opacification has improved since [**2186-3-20**].
2. Mild vascular congestion improved since [**2186-3-20**].
3. Retrocardiac opacity and left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
4. Aerococcus UTI c/b septicemia: Improving as fevers have been trending down but still with low-grade temps. No evidence of infective endocarditis by TTE and clinical exam. Repeat blood cultures have shown no new growth since [**3-17**]. CXR unremarkable.
- Repeat U/A and culture give low-grade temps.
- Treating with Unasyn for a 2-week course (started [**3-21**] -> end [**4-4**]).
- F/u surveillance blood cultures (no growth to date).

   - Patient continued to have secretions that nurses were suctioning
   frequently.  We got a CXR that overall looked better:
   1. Right basilar opacification has improved since [**2186-3-20**].

","The patient's chief complaint is vomiting. The reason for transfer to the MICU was acute mental status changes and a suspected seizure. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke, which could be related to the altered mental status and potential seizure activity. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other ICU medications. The patient's blood cultures have been pending since admission, indicating a possible infection. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The imaging reveals opacification in the right basilar region of the lungs, which has improved since the previous day, as well as unchanged retrocardiac opacity and left lower lobe atelectasis. 

The patient is currently at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect their airway. They also have coagulopathy, acute pulmonary embolism, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, bacteremia, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, seizure, urinary tract infection, and tachycardia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 161/89 to 164/99 mmHg, heart rate between 79 and 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 97-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS), seizures, and fevers. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several days. The patient's AMS and level of alertness have been waxing and waning but are slowly improving. There is no evidence of sustained seizure activity on EEG. The patient's infection assessment is ongoing, and he is being monitored for any signs of new infection. He has a low-grade temperature and increased secretions. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Aerococcus and bacteremia. He remains on mechanical ventilation with stable oxygen saturation. His physical examination shows some neurological deficits. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal lab values. An MRI of the brain showed no bleeding or acute cerebral vascular accident.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged post-ictal state: The patient's AMS and fluctuating alertness may be due to a prolonged post-ictal state following the seizures. Close monitoring and further evaluation, such as a radionucleotide brain perfusion study and continuous EEG monitoring, are recommended.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers, a UTI caused by Aerococcus, and bacteremia. Infection assessment should continue, and surveillance cultures have been negative so far. The patient is already"
