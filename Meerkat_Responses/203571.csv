   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with coffee ground
   emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
   .
   #. Hematemesis: The patient is currently on Aspirin, Plavix and
   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevating to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer
   disease, but unlikely given her lack of discomfort.  No plan for EGD at
   this time per GI.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**], anti-emetics
   - GI Aware, deferring endoscopy at this time
   - Hold Warfarin, INR currently reversed, check daily
   - T&S active, ensure access, blood consent obtained
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Q12 hematocrits
   - will plan to advance diet as tolerated
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient has a sustained
   rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation.  I think her rapid rate is due to loss of blood
   volume and it is affecting her forward flow as her blood pressure is
   tenuous at 98-100/40s (MAPs~65).
   - currently sinus
   - Hold Beta blockade, use Amio if blood ineffective at rate control
   .
   #. Hypoxia/COPD: The patient has an O2 requirement but is otherwise
   doing well.  Her CXR reveals effusions, likely fluid overload.  Given
   her leukocytosis and low grade fever, it is possible she has a
   Pneumonia, possibly aspiration from her recent emesis.
   - Abx per Leukocytosis plan
   - Nebs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - DNI
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient has a rapidly rising WBC
   with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent Enterobacter
   infection) and ? PNA on CXR.  She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED
   presumably for a PNA.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA PNA and possible enterococcus UTI
   - d/c cipro and cont  Cefepime to complete ICU HAP coverage and cover
   urinary organisms
   - F/U Blood cultures, add on Urine cultures
   - Trend WBC and fever
   - sputum cx
   .
   #. CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient currently on ASA, Plavix and metoprolol
   after recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware present.
   Troponin elevated to 0.10 with normal CK/[**Name (NI) 13420**], unclear what her
   troponin trend has been from her recent NSTEMI, but with impaired GFR
   and recent STEMI this may represent old MI, renal failure or MI within
   the last 7 days. EKG not revealing of ST changes
   - Hold Plavix for now
   - consider restarting ASA 162mg enteric coating
   - Cycle Cardiac Enzymes
   - Obtain St. E records
   - Hold on anticoagulation at this time
   - DNR confirmed with daughter
   .
   #. ? PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE from St. Es, no
   confirmatory test performed per HebReb records and Daughter.  [**Name (NI) 1490**]
   uncertain and her current high bleeding risk, will hold Coumadin and
   tolerate INR <2.0.
   - Obtain [**Hospital3 1004**] records
   - Consider CTA Chest once stable
   .
   #. R bimallelor fracture: Spoke with Orthopedics Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13421**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13422**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13423**] (Cell) from [**Hospital3 **].  The patient is
   due for cast removal, but must have an Aircast Ankle brace to replace
   it until ~ [**2125-1-16**].  Patient is Bed to Chair and Touch Down Weight
   Bearing per her orthopedist. He would like to be called by Ortho with
   follow up.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly individual with multiple medical complications. The key points from the progress note are as follows:

1. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and was admitted with coffee ground emesis due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She is currently on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, which may have contributed to the bleeding.

2. The patient's INR is elevated, likely due to an interaction between ciprofloxacin and warfarin. Her INR needs to be closely monitored, and warfarin has been temporarily held.

3. The patient has a recent history of NSTEMI and is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. There is an elevated troponin level, indicating possible ongoing cardiac ischemia or a previous myocardial infarction.

4. The patient has a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but confirmatory tests have not been performed. Anticoagulation has been held due to the high bleeding risk.

5. The patient has leukocytosis with bacteriuria and a positive urine analysis for Enterobacter infection. She received vancomycin and cefepime in the emergency department. Antibiotic coverage needs to be continued and further blood and urine cultures should be obtained.

6. The patient has COPD with hypoxia and is on oxygen supplementation. There is evidence of fluid overload, and pneumonia is suspected"

She has a history of atrial fibrillation, recent NSTEMI, and possible pulmonary embolism. She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 108/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is 37.6 degrees Celsius.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 25.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and a troponin level of 0.11 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular abnormalities, stable respiratory status, and no neurologic deficits.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to a mucosal bleed, possibly caused by gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. She is on PPI, anti-emetics, and has her INR reversed. She is also being monitored for further bleeding.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate: The patient has a sustained rate of 120s-130s in atr"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with coffee ground
   emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
   .
   #. Hematemesis: The patient is currently on Aspirin, Plavix and
   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevating to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer
   disease, but unlikely given her lack of discomfort.
   - PPI gtt, anti-emetics
   - GI Aware, deferring endoscopy at this time
   - Hold Warfarin, INR currently reversed, check daily
   - T&S active, ensure access, blood consent obtained
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Attempt NG lavage only with further vomiting
   - Q6 hematocrits & Lactate
   - NPO
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient has a sustained
   rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation.  I think her rapid rate is due to loss of blood
   volume and it is affecting her forward flow as her blood pressure is
   tenuous at 98-100/40s (MAPs~65).
   - Transfuse 1 unit pRBCs followed by Lasix for volume resuscitation
   - Hold Beta blockade, use Amio if blood ineffective at rate control
   .
   #. Hypoxia/COPD: The patient has an O2 requirement but is otherwise
   doing well.  Her CXR reveals effusions, likely fluid overload.  Given
   her leukocytosis and low grade fever, it is possible she has a
   Pneumonia, possibly aspiration from her recent emesis.
   - Abx per Leukocytosis plan
   - Nebs
   - O2 prn
   - DNI
   - Diuresis with Lasix as BP tolerates/after blood
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient has a rapidly rising WBC
   with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent Enterobacter
   infection) and ? PNA on CXR.  She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED
   presumably for a PNA.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA PNA and possible enterococcus UTI
   - Change Zosyn to Cefepime/Cipro to complete ICU HAP coverage and cover
   urinary organisms and anerobes
   - F/U Blood cultures, add on Urine cultures
   - Trend WBC and fever
   .
   #. CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient currently on [**Month/Day (1) **], Plavix and metoprolol
   after recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware present.
   Troponin elevated to 0.10 with normal CK/[**Name (NI) 13420**], unclear what her
   troponin trend has been from her recent NSTEMI, but with impaired GFR
   and recent STEMI this may represent old MI, renal failure or MI within
   the last 7 days. EKG not revealing of ST changes
   - Hold [**Name (NI) **] and Plavix for right now (she has taken them within the last
   24-30 hours), restart within the next 24 hours based on clinical status
   - Cycle Cardiac Enzymes
   - Obtain St. E records
   - Hold on anticoagulation at this time
   - DNR confirmed with daughter
   - Restart [**Name2 (NI) **] tomorrow AM
   .
   #. ? PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE from St. Es, no
   confirmatory test performed per HebReb records and Daughter.  [**Name (NI) 1490**]
   uncertain and her current high bleeding risk, will hold Coumadin and
   tolerate INR <2.0.
   - Obtain [**Hospital3 1004**] records

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical complications. She was admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation center with coffee ground emesis and a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, recent NSTEMI, possible pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin for her cardiovascular conditions.

The patient's current conditions include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoxia/COPD, leukocytosis with bacteriuria, and a possible pneumonia. Her white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, and she has positive urine analysis for Enterobacter infection. She also has an uncertain history of pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to her use of aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin. She has not vomited and does not have melena or frank bloody stools. The plan is to administer PPI, anti-emetics, and hold warfarin. Daily INR monitoring is recommended, and she should be guaiac tested. NPO status and NG lavage are also part of the plan.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient has a sustained rapid heart rate in atrial fibrillation. This is likely due to loss of blood volume and is affecting her"

","The patient's chief complaint is coffee ground emesis. They have a history of atrial fibrillation but are currently in sinus rhythm. They have gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed, GIB), which will require an endoscopy. There is also a concern for possible lower left lung pneumonia (UTI/? LLL pneumonia) and a potential pulmonary embolism (PE), although there is no strong evidence for PE based on electrocardiogram (EtE) records. The patient's sodium levels are high, which may be due to hypovolemia, so they will be given oral fluids. 

The patient is on several medications including protonix IV, cefepime 500 IV q24, ciprofloxacin 400 q24, and vancomycin q48. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/59 to 133/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 25.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 242 K/uL, and platelet count of 377. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges. Imaging shows no evidence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with COPD and colon cancer, admitted for coffee ground emesis and acute blood loss anemia. She was on supratherapeutic INR, ASA, and Plavix, and had rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after blood and fluids. She has not experienced obvious bleeding in the ICU, and her serial HCT levels have remained unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB): The patient presented with coffee ground emesis, which indicates the presence of digested blood in the stomach. This suggests a possible UGIB, which can lead to acute blood loss anemia and hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, prolonged immobility in the ICU, and the use of anticoagulants, there is a risk of developing DVT. DVT can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) if a blood clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient has been receiving IV fluids, but her blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypovolemia. This could be due to ongoing bleeding, inadequate fluid resuscitation, or both.
4. Medication-related complications: The patient was on multiple anticoagulants (INR, ASA, Plavix) that increase"

   A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with coffee ground
   emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.  While ready for
   transfer to the floor, she developed A fib with RVR and dyspnea.
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient developed a rate of
   120s complicated by worsening pleural effusions and edema.  Responsive
   to Lopressor overnight.
   - Start metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Diuresis with Lasix 10mg prn goal -2-3L today
   #. Pulmonary edema: worse with atrial Fib
   - Rate control
   - Diuresis as above
   #. Hematemesis: The patient was admitted on Aspirin, Plavix and
   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevated to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer
   disease, but unlikely given her lack of discomfort.  No plan for EGD at
   this time per GI.  Episode of guaiac positive mucous production
   overnight, clots stable.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**], anti-emetics
   - GI Aware, deferring endoscopy at this time
   - Hold Warfarin, INR currently reversed, check daily
   - T&S active, ensure access, blood consent obtained
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Q12 hematocrits
   - will plan to advance diet as tolerated
   #. Dyspnea/Hypoxia/? PNA vs. COPD: Given leukocytosis (resolving) and
   worsening dyspnea
   - Abx per Leukocytosis plan
   - Nebs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - DNI
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient has a rapidly rising WBC
   with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent Enterobacter
   infection) and ? PNA on CXR.  She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED
   presumably for a PNA.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA PNA and possible enterococcus UTI
   - cont  Cefepime to complete ICU HAP coverage and cover urinary
   organisms
   - F/U Blood cultures, add on Urine cultures
   - Trend WBC and fever

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation facility with coffee ground emesis and a supratherapeutic INR. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and dyspnea, which was responsive to metoprolol. The patient also has pulmonary edema worsening with atrial fibrillation and hematemesis. She has a history of recent NSTEMI and possible PE. The patient's INR has been elevated due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction, and she is on warfarin. There is no plan for endoscopy at this time, and her INR is currently reversed. The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift and positive U/A, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED for suspected pneumonia. The patient also has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI, and her troponin levels are elevated. She is currently on ASA, Plavix, and metoprolol, and her anticoagulation has been held. The patient has a right bimalleolar fracture and is due for cast removal, but she needs an Aircast ankle brace. She is bed to chair and touch down weight bearing per her orthopedist.

 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with coffee ground
   emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
   .
   #. Hematemesis: The patient is currently on Aspirin, Plavix and
   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevating to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer
   disease, but unlikely given her lack of discomfort.  No plan for EGD at
   this time per GI.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**], anti-emetics
   - GI Aware, deferring endoscopy at this time
   - Hold Warfarin, INR currently reversed, check daily
   - T&S active, ensure access, blood consent obtained
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Q12 hematocrits
   - will plan to advance diet as tolerated
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient has a sustained
   rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation.  I think her rapid rate is due to loss of blood
   volume and it is affecting her forward flow as her blood pressure is
   tenuous at 98-100/40s (MAPs~65).
   - currently sinus
   - Hold Beta blockade, use Amio if blood ineffective at rate control
   .
   #. Hypoxia/COPD: The patient has an O2 requirement but is otherwise
   doing well.  Her CXR reveals effusions, likely fluid overload.  Given
   her leukocytosis and low grade fever, it is possible she has a
   Pneumonia, possibly aspiration from her recent emesis.
   - Abx per Leukocytosis plan
   - Nebs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - DNI
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient has a rapidly rising WBC
   with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent Enterobacter
   infection) and ? PNA on CXR.  She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED
   presumably for a PNA.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA PNA and possible enterococcus UTI
   - d/c cipro and cont  Cefepime to complete ICU HAP coverage and cover
   urinary organisms
   - F/U Blood cultures, add on Urine cultures
   - Trend WBC and fever
   - sputum cx
   .
   #. CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient currently on ASA, Plavix and metoprolol
   after recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware present.
   Troponin elevated to 0.10 with normal CK/[**Name (NI) 13420**], unclear what her
   troponin trend has been from her recent NSTEMI, but with impaired GFR
   and recent STEMI this may represent old MI, renal failure or MI within
   the last 7 days. EKG not revealing of ST changes
   - Hold Plavix for now
   - consider restarting ASA 162mg enteric coating
   - Cycle Cardiac Enzymes
   - Obtain St. E records
   - Hold on anticoagulation at this time
   - DNR confirmed with daughter
   .
   #. ? PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE from St. Es, no
   confirmatory test performed per HebReb records and Daughter.  [**Name (NI) 1490**]
   uncertain and her current high bleeding risk, will hold Coumadin and
   tolerate INR <2.0.
   - Obtain [**Hospital3 1004**] records
   - Consider CTA Chest once stable
   .
   #. R bimallelor fracture: Spoke with Orthopedics Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13421**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13422**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13423**] (Cell) from [**Hospital3 **].  The patient is

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation center with coffee ground emesis. She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), recent NSTEMI, and a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's current conditions include gastrointestinal bleed (upper), hypoxia/COPD, leukocytosis with bacteriuria, and a fracture in her right lower extremity.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to her elevated INR and the use of anticoagulants such as warfarin. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and regular assessment of stool and emesis for signs of bleeding are necessary.

2. Hypoxia/COPD exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and oxygen therapy may be required. Chest physiotherapy and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis should also be considered.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and positive urine analysis indicating a possible urinary tract infection. Close monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and regular assessment of sputum and urine cultures are necessary. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and AFIB. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram (ECG), and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ankle fracture, anticoagulated, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been in the ICU, experiencing recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR, pulmonary edema, hematemesis, and is critically ill. The patient has a history of allergies to Nystatin, Tetracycline, and unknown medications. She received Ciprofloxacin previously. The patient is on various infusions including metoprolol, furosemide, and other medications such as cefepime, vancomycin, and aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, likely due to congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Continuous diuresis should be maintained to manage this condition.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires continued treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce the risk of further bleeding.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which needs to be controlled. The patient received a bolus IV metoprolol and will start standing PO lopressor at home dose.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has an ongoing fluid balance issue, with total in - 1,664 mL, total out - 480 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,463 mL. Monitoring and managing fluid intake and output is crucial.
5. Respiratory Issues: The patient has crackles at the right base and diminished breath sounds on the right side, indicating possible pulmonary edema or infection. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this condition.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.1 K/uL. This could indicate an infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring and appropriate treatment should be implemented.
8. Other lab abnormalities: The patient has elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, low platelet count (Plt), and elevated troponin-T levels. These findings may indicate kidney dysfunction, possible bleeding, or myocardial injury. Further investigation and management are required.
9. Imaging findings: The patient's chest X-ray shows left effusion and possible infiltrate, which could suggest a respiratory infection or heart failure. Further evaluation and management are needed based on these findings.

The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential medical complications to improve her health status."

The patient's blood glucose level is 131 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 25.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, platelet count is 377 K/uL, creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.11 ng/mL.

The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, furosemide, cefepime, vancomycin, ASA, and lopressor. She has been given a bolus IV metoprolol for rate control of atrial fibrillation. The patient's imaging shows a left effusion and possible infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Leukocytosis: Improving.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime empirically.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): Rate better controlled overnight"

   - Diuresis as above
   #. Hematemesis: The patient was admitted on Aspirin, Plavix and
   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevated to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation hospital with coffee ground emesis, supratherapeutic INR, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and dyspnea. She has a history of malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleed. She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and possible PE. Her INR is elevated due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction. The patient also has leukocytosis with a left shift, positive U/A, and worsening dyspnea. She has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but the trend is unclear. She has a right bimalleolar fracture and is bed-to-chair with touch-down weight bearing. She has hypernatremia and is being treated with gentle IVF, repletion of lytes, and advancement of diet as tolerated. The patient has a DNR/DNI code, and her daughter is the contact person.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Rate: The patient developed a rate of 120s complicated by worsening pleural effusions and edema. This can lead to poor cardiac output and hypotension.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has worsening dyspnea and signs of pulmonary edema. This can lead to respiratory distress and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation hospital with coffee ground emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. She has a history of malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, fracture, leukocytosis, and recent NSTEMI. She is currently being treated for atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and pulmonary edema with diuretics. She also has dyspnea and hypoxia, and there is a suspicion of pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. Her leukocytosis is ongoing despite antibiotic therapy, and she is being treated for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has hematemesis, which is likely due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly caused by aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin. Her INR is elevated, likely due to a ciprofloxacin interaction. She has a history of coronary artery disease and a recent NSTEMI, for which she is on aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. She has a right bimalleolar fracture and is scheduled for cast removal with an Aircast ankle brace. She has hypernatremia, which is worsening.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/63 to 156/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypoxemia, fracture, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal possible right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include various interventions such as follow-up with orthopedics for a fracture, repeat urine culture and sputum culture to evaluate leukocytosis, titration of lopressor for atrial fibrillation with RVR, discontinuation of vancomycin due to lack of evidence for MRSA pneumonia, continuation of cefepime, maintenance of even fluid balance, and close monitoring of glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions and interventions include:

   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]; his note and the ICU team
   note from today reflect my input.  I would add/emphasize that she had
   been doing better until a few hours ago.  Was eating and then after
   being put into bed began coughing and had food and coffee come up.
   Now, more somnolent.  CXR with some increased basilar opacities.  HR up
   to 120s again.
   Resp distress
 appears to have both aspiration and intermittent acute
   diastolic CHF
   Aspiration
 appears to have silent aspiration.  Speech/swallow.  NPO
   for now.  Consider broadening ABX if not improved shortly.
   Atrial fibrillation
 beta blockade
   Encephalopathy
 likely related to resp distress/aspiration/AFib.
   Follow clinically for now
   GI bleed
 not presently bleeding.  Follow Hct.
   Fracture
 follow up ortho recs
   Maintain in ICU given acute respiratory distress and encephalopathy.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with a gastrointestinal bleed and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and cefepime. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. She is experiencing tachycardia and tachypnea. 

Her physical examination reveals crackles in both lung bases, wheezes bilaterally, diminished breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, oriented, and has purposeful movements with normal tone. 

Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function tests. The WBC count has increased from 11.8 to 25.1 thousand cells/microliter over the past day. Her platelet count is low at 222 thousand cells/microliter. 

The patient's recent blood product transfusions have resulted in a total input of 1,020 mL, with a total output of 2,842 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,822 mL. 

Assessment and plan include fracture follow-up, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypoxemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress due to possible aspiration or worsening of her current condition, cardiac complications related to atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response, infection due to leukocytosis and possible antibiotic use, and ongoing gastrointestinal bleed or rebleeding. 

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory distress, cardiac status, infection risk, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

   A [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the MICU from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with coffee ground
   emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.  While ready for
   transfer to the floor, she developed A fib with RVR and dyspnea.

   metoprolol, but still tachycardic.  Pulmonary edema improving with
   diuresis.  CHADS 1.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1
   - Increase to metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - no anticoagulation given comorbidities, recent hematemesis, low CHADS

   Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during a [**Month (only) 25**] admission to [**Hospital **].  Her INR has been elevated to [**2-19**], likely due to a
   Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.  She
   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all
   while in the MICU.  Other possibilities include gastritis or ulcer
   disease, but unlikely given her lack of discomfort.  No plan for EGD at
   this time per GI.  Continues to have brown sputum.  Hct stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the MICU from rehab with coffee ground emesis. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, recent NSTEMI, malnutrition, and a fracture. The patient's current conditions include hypovolemia, pneumonia, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, warfarin, metoprolol, and PPI. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated INR, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 69%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient is experiencing volume depletion without shock. This can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and worsening dyspnea, which may indicate an infection in the lungs. If left untreated, it can progress to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of taking anticoagulants and presents with coffee ground emesis, suggesting upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

24-hour events include:
- Nurse assessment and swallow evaluation
- Metoprolol switched to IV administration
- Heart rate improved to the high 90s and blood pressure stabilized
- Heparin sodium infusion initiated
- Review of systems unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart rate: 94 bpm (78-119 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 120/56 mmHg (75-140/92 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (10-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 69% on aerosol-cool delivery device
- Atrial fibrillation

Fluid balance:
- Total in: 1,726 mL
- Total out: 1,710 mL
- Balance: 16 mL

Laboratory results:
- White blood cell count: 16.8 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 30.6%
- Platelet count: 262 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
- Glucose: 122 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.11 ng/mL
- Other lab values provided

Assessment and plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypovolemia, pneumonia, malnutrition, fracture, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, and acute kidney injury. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer, and ventilation-associated pneumonia precautions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 16 mL over 24 hours, indicating ongoing fluid depletion. If not corrected, this could lead to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory rate suggest possible pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed needs prompt evaluation and management to prevent further blood loss and potential shock.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation. If not adequately controlled, this can increase the risk of thromboembolic events and hemodynamic instability.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. Prompt intervention is necessary to prevent further kidney damage and manage associated complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition may contribute to delayed wound healing, infections, and overall poor prognosis. Nutritional support should be initiated as soon as possible.
7. Fracture: The patient's fracture could be a source of infection or further complications if not managed appropriately.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response."

   appears to only have an upper source (mucosal bleed) and has not yet
   developed melena or frank bloody stools.  She has not vomited at all

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the MICU from a rehabilitation center with coffee ground emesis. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, recent NSTEMI, and possible pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently experiencing hypovolemia, pneumonia, malnutrition, fracture, leukocytosis, and upper gastrointestinal bleed. She has an elevated INR due to warfarin interaction and is being held off anticoagulation. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but it is unclear if this represents an old myocardial infarction, renal failure, or a recent STEMI. She has a bimalleolar fracture and is weight-bearing with an air cast ankle brace. The patient has hypernatremia and is being repleted with IV fluids and advanced diet as tolerated. She has a DNR/DNI status and her daughter is her contact person.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating that she may have ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid intake. This can lead to further dehydration and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and worsening dyspnea suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of taking aspirin, Plavix, and warfarin puts her at risk for gastrointestinal"

","The patient is an elderly female with multiple medical issues including pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, malnutrition, a history of a recent NSTEMI, and a fractured right leg. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 69%. She is on supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals an irregular heartbeat, bibasilar dull breath sounds, and no use of accessory muscles. There is no abdominal distention or tenderness.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 11.1 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.0 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 2.0 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's plan of care includes management for hypovolemia, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. Diuretics have been held due to the patient appearing euvolemic. Clopidogrel and aspirin have been held due to recent hematemesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, progression of hypovolemia, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, and further gastrointestinal bleeding."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with hematemesis and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and low urine output. They have been on various medications including cefepime, pantoprazole, aspirin, heparin, lopressor, and statin.

During their stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several events. They aspirated on Saturday and Sunday, leading to respiratory distress. They were evaluated by a speech-language pathologist and put on a dysphagia diet. The patient's condition improved, but they had another episode of aspiration yesterday, which prompted a hold on their transfer to the floor.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 149/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient had trace edema in their left lower extremity.

Lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Other lab values were within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging showed improved aeration of the right base on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and will continue to"
