   This is a 71 year old female with a history of MVR, AFib, and CAD who
   presented to the ED with chest pain and found to be having anterior
   STEMI requiring BMS to LAD and placement of IABP post procedure.
   .
   CORONARIES: s/p anterior STEMI and s/p BMS to LAD. IABP placed given
   significantly anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during cath.
   Patient currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.  Finished
   on integrillin and started heparin gtt
   - cont  heparin gtt
   - cont plavix 75mg daily
   - cont ASA 325 mg daily
   - start atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - plan for removal of IABP today, will need post-shealth removal check
   - ECHO today
   - monitor on CCU telemetry
   .
   PUMP: As noted above, anterior all motion abnormalities noted during
   cath. Right heart revealed wedge pressures in 30's. She was given 10mg
   IV lasix in the cath lab and a IABP placed.  She was given additional
   20mg IV lasix yesterday. Negative 900cc. Patient currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - IABP removal today
   - ECHO in am
   - monitor I/O's with goal -500 cc
   - cont BB
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm. Pt has a hx of PAF (not on coumadin
   due to pt insistence). Pt with episode of A-fib w/ RVR overnight that
   resolved to sinus after lopessor, then went into a-flutter w/ RVR and
   given dilt.  She reverted to sinus this AM.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - Gather OSH information to better understand whether pt requires
   anticoagulation
   - if goes back into Afib will conisder amio
   - if EF < 35% will strongly consider coumadin
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with  episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable. Likely
   exacerbated by heparin gtt
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - Suggest outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was also placed due to significant anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during catheterization.

The patient has been receiving integrillin and heparin therapy, as well as medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 128/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels, but within normal range for creatinine, potassium, and magnesium.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current medical conditions include myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI), pain control, heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute. The plan includes removal of IABP today, echocardiogram (ECHO) in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery and received an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) post-procedure. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 70-90 mmHg systolic. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is necessary to detect any further changes.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and experienced episodes of atrial flutter overnight. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be continued to promptly identify any arrhythmias.
3. Heart failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, as evidenced by wedge pressures in the 30s on right heart catheterization. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure symptoms is essential.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of hemoptysis and bleeding risks, including the use of heparin and antiplatelet medications. Close monitoring of respiratory status and hematocrit levels is required.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery and was also given an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to significant anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during the catheterization.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She has completed integrillin therapy and started on heparin gtt. She is also taking clopidogrel 75mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and metoprolol 37.5mg. The plan is to remove the IABP today and perform an echocardiogram (echo) today as well. She will continue to be monitored on critical care unit (CCU) telemetry.

The patient's pump function shows anterior wall motion abnormalities during catheterization, and right heart catheterization revealed wedge pressures in the 30s. She received 10mg IV lasix in the cath lab and had an IABP placed. She was given additional 20mg IV lasix yesterday, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 900cc. The patient appears euvolemic.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
   This is a 71 year old female with a history of MVR, AFib, and CAD who
   presented to the ED with chest pain and found to be having anterior
   STEMI requiring BMS to LAD and placement of IABP post procedure.
   .
   CORONARIES: s/p anterior STEMI and s/p BMS to LAD. IABP placed given
   significantly anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during cath.
   Patient currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.  Finished
   on integrillin and started heparin gtt
   - cont  heparin gtt
   - cont plavix 75mg daily
   - cont ASA 325 mg daily
   - start atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - plan for removal of IABP today, will need post-shealth removal check
   - ECHO today
   - monitor on CCU telemetry
   .
   PUMP: As noted above, anterior all motion abnormalities noted during
   cath. Right heart revealed wedge pressures in 30's. She was given 10mg
   IV lasix in the cath lab and a IABP placed.  She was given additional
   20mg IV lasix yesterday. Negative 900cc. Patient currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - IABP removal today
   - ECHO in am
   - monitor I/O's with goal -500 cc
   - cont BB
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm. Pt has a hx of PAF (not on coumadin
   due to pt insistence). Pt with episode of A-fib w/ RVR overnight that
   resolved to sinus after lopessor, then went into a-flutter w/ RVR and
   given dilt.  She reverted to sinus this AM.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - Gather OSH information to better understand whether pt requires
   anticoagulation
   - if goes back into Afib will conisder amio
   - if EF < 35% will strongly consider coumadin
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with  episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable. Likely
   exacerbated by heparin gtt
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools
   - monitor Hct
   - Suggest outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) post-procedure.

The patient's current condition is stable, and she is hemodynamically stable without any chest pain. The assessment and plan indicate that she has acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and ongoing pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Recurrent arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFib, and she experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) overnight, which resolved to sinus rhythm after administration of lopressor. She then went into atrial flutter with RVR and was given diltiazem, but reverted to sinus rhythm in the morning.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Although the patient is currently hemodynamically stable, there is a risk of developing hemodynamic instability due to ongoing heart failure and potential complications from the IABP.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), for which she received bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support post-procedure.

The patient has been hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free since then. She has been started on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, clopidogrel (plavix) 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. An ACE inhibitor has also been started today.

In terms of her heart failure, she is being monitored closely for any signs of worsening. Gentle diuresis is being continued to manage her fluid balance. Her blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, and she is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's recent episode of hemoptysis is likely related to pulmonary edema in the setting of high wedge pressures. Her respiratory status is being monitored, and her hemoglobin concentration is stable.

There is a history of bleeding diathesis, so the patient is currently holding coumadin pending an echocardiogram read. Additionally,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was also placed due to significant anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during the catheterization.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She is being monitored in the coronary care unit (CCU) with continuous cardiac telemetry. The patient's blood pressure is 111/70 mmHg, heart rate is 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is elevated at 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F). She has a history of previous episodes of hemoptysis, but this is the first time it has occurred. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is currently stable at 32.5%. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 20.2 K/uL.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase"

The patient's general appearance is described as well appearing, and she is oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, or throat (HEENT), neck, or cardiac areas. However, the patient has increased sputum production that has changed to blood consistency, which may indicate ongoing hemoptysis. No other significant findings are noted in the abdomen, extremities, or skin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), for which she received balloon angioplasty (BMS) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) post-procedure.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She has been started on clopidogrel, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol, and continues to receive heparin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 mmHg to 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is also on cardiac telemetry.

Her physical examination reveals a well-appearing patient with no signs of pallor or cyanosis, and her lung fields are clear. She has mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall and apex, as well as moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior STEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and was placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) post-procedure due to significant anterior wall motion abnormalities.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She is receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, anticoagulation with heparin, and statin therapy with atorvastatin. The plan is to remove the IABP today, perform an echocardiogram (echo), and continue monitoring on cardiac care unit (CCU) telemetry.

The patient's pump function shows anterior wall motion abnormalities and right heart catheterization revealed elevated wedge pressures in the 30s. She received intravenous lasix in the cath lab and has had a negative fluid balance of 900cc. The patient appears euvolemic, and the goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of -500cc.

The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) overnight, which resolved to sinus rhythm after diltiazem administration. She then developed atrial flutter with RVR and was given"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMOPTYSIS
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
   This is a 71 year old female with a history of MVR, AFib, and CAD who
   presented to the ED with chest pain and found to be having anterior
   STEMI requiring BMS to LAD and placement of IABP post procedure.
   .
   CORONARIES: s/p anterior STEMI and s/p BMS to LAD. Patient currently
   hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.  Finished on integrillin
   and started heparin gtt; heparin dc
d [**2184-6-21**]. IABP dc
   - cont plavix 75mg daily
   - cont ASA 325 mg daily
   - start atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - start ACE-I today
   - monitor on CCU telemetry
   .
   PUMP: As noted above, anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during
   cath. Currently negative 84cc, still with crackles at lung bases. Will
   continue gentle diuresis.
   - monitor I/O's with goal -500 cc
   - cont BB, lasix
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm. Pt has a hx of PAF (not on coumadin
   at home due to pt insistence). Pt with episode of A-fib w/ RVR
   overnight 06/21-22/09 that resolved to sinus after lopessor, then went
   into a-flutter w/ RVR and given dilt.  She reverted to sinus the
   morning of [**2184-6-21**] and has remained in NSR since then.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - if goes back into Afib will conisder amio
   - Holding coumadin today pending echo read, given bleeding diathesis
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with  episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable. Likely
   exacerbated by heparin gtt and related to pulmonary edema in setting of
   high wedge pressures.
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools
   - monitor Hct, currently stable
   - Suggest outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up
   .
   FEN: HH, replete lytes PRN
   ACCESS: PIV's, 8F sheath x 2
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Pain management with percocet (patient denies any allergy to this
   medication which she is listed as allergic to in OMR)
   -Bowel regimen with docusate and senna

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], Harish.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   IABP out yesterday.   No CP, no SOB.
   EF 35% on echo.
   Low grade temp, WBC 15.8.
   Blood tinged sputum,  small BRBPR.
   Physical Examination
   chest with few bibasilar rales.
   Medical Decision Making
   Lasix 20 for gentle diuresis.
   Add ACE as tolerated.
   Would not add coumadin in view of bleeding risk esp on ASA and plavix.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

   .
   CORONARIES: s/p anterior STEMI and s/p BMS to LAD. Patient currently
   hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.  Finished on integrillin
   and started heparin gtt; heparin dc
d [**2184-6-21**], then restarted [**2184-6-22**]
   for hypokenesis.
   - cont plavix 75mg daily
   - cont ASA 325 mg daily
   - start atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   - cont lisinopril 5mg daily
   - monitor on CCU telemetry
   .
   PUMP: As noted above, anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during
   cath. Currently negative 84cc, crackles improved with gentle diuresis.
   - monitor I/O's with goal -2L, Lasix as needed
   - cont BB
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm.  Due to a.fib [**6-22**] she was loaded on
   amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm.  Overnight [**6-22**] had
   several brief episodes of a.fib at slower rhythms and then 30 minutes
   when she first woke up of atrial flutter w/ HR in the 120s that
   resolved with Ativan to calm her, remained hemodynamically stable.
   Continued to have intermittent asymptomatic a fib this AM.
   - give 150 mg amio now
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP a-flutter ablation as outpatient
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - started on warfarin 2.5mg QD.
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable.  Has been
   decreasing in quantity, but needs to be monitored closely while
   starting warfarin.
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. Her current rhythm is sinus rhythm, but she has had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. She is being treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin.

She has a history of hemoptysis, which has decreased in quantity but needs to be monitored closely while starting warfarin. She also has a history of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) without any gross lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She has never had a colonoscopy and is suggested to undergo one for further evaluation.

The patient's kidney function is normal, but her liver enzymes are elevated, particularly ALT and AST. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low calcium and magnesium levels. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit are within"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 71 year old female with a history of MVR, AFib, and CAD who
   presented to the ED with chest pain and found to be having anterior
   [**Telephone/Fax (2) **] requiring BMS to LAD and placement of IABP post procedure.
   .
   CORONARIES: s/p anterior [**Telephone/Fax (2) **] and s/p BMS to LAD. Patient currently
   hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.  Finished on integrillin
   and started heparin gtt; heparin dc
d [**2184-6-21**], then restarted [**2184-6-22**]
   for hypokenesis.
   - cont plavix 75mg daily
   - cont ASA 325 mg daily
   - start atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   - cont lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   - monitor on CCU telemetry
   .
   PUMP: As noted above, anterior wall motion abnormalities noted during
   cath. Currently negative 84cc, crackles improved with gentle diuresis
   but still requiring low flow oxygen.
   - monitor I/O's with goal net negative -1L today
   - cont BB
   - Continue daily lasix; prn lasix as needed to meet I/O goal
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm.  Due to a.fib yesterday she was
   loaded on amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm.  Overnight
   [**6-22**] had several brief episodes of a.fib at slower rhythms and then 30
   minutes when she first woke up of atrial flutter w/ HR in the 120s that
   resolved with Ativan to calm her.  Started on Amio gtt for recurrent
   Afib yesterday as well as Heparin drip with transition to coumadin for
   anticoagulation.
   - Transition to PO Amiodarone 400mg po BID x 1 week starting today
   given completion of 24 hour IV load this afternoon, then 200mg po daily
   thereafter
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter; though no plans for flutter
   ablation at the moment given recent [**Name (NI) **]
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - continue warfarin 2.5mg QD.
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable.  Has been
   decreasing in quantity, but needs to be monitored closely while
   starting warfarin.
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools
   - monitor Hct, currently stable
   - Suggest outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and underwent an anterior myocardial infarction, requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery. 

The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. She has been loaded on amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm. She is also receiving heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. 

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has a history of hemoptysis, which is currently stable, and has noted black, tarry stools in the past but never any gross lower gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's fluid balance is negative 1.4 liters, indicating fluid overload. She has been given Lasix for this condition.

The patient is planned to be transitioned to the floor today given her sinus rhythm. Her care will continue with close monitoring of her rhythm, hemoptysis, and fluid balance"

   overnight 06/21-22/09 that resolved to sinus after lopessor, then went
   into a-flutter w/ RVR and given dilt.  She reverted to sinus the
   morning of [**2184-6-21**] and has remained in NSR since then.
   - cont metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - if goes back into Afib will conisder amio
   - Holding coumadin today pending echo read, given bleeding diathesis
   .
   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with  episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable. Likely
   exacerbated by heparin gtt and related to pulmonary edema in setting of
   high wedge pressures.
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct
   .
   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools
   - monitor Hct, currently stable
   - Suggest outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) post-procedure.

The patient has been in the ICU since admission and is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She has received integrillin and started on heparin drip, with subsequent discontinuation of heparin on 06/21. The patient continues on clopidogrel 75mg daily, aspirin 325mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily, metoprolol 37.5mg, and an ACE inhibitor.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which have been managed with diltiazem and atenolol. She is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is not on coumadin at home due to patient insistence. The patient's ejection fraction is currently negative 84cc, indicating reduced cardiac function. She has also been experiencing crackles at the lung bases, likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to high wedge pressures. The patient's hemopt"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Low grade temp 100.7.
   Loaded on amio for recurrent aflutter/afib and back in afib this AM.
   Negative 1.7 L after lasix 20.
   SBP borderline 90 so lisinopril held but getting Lopressor 25 tid.
   On heparin and coumadin.
   Physical Examination
   comfortable
   Medical Decision Making
   Will give additional iv amiodarone.
   Decr lisinopril to 2.5 daily.
   Continue diuresis.
   Focus on controlling atrial arrythmias with consideration of Aflutter
   ablation in future.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to an anterior wall myocardial infarction. She also received a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery and an intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter/AFib: The patient experienced recurrent episodes of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. She was loaded on amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm. She is currently on amiodarone for recurrent atrial fibrillation and also on metoprolol. The plan is to transition to oral amiodarone maintenance dose after completing the 24-hour IV load. 
2. Hemoptysis: The patient reported an episode of hemoptysis, which she has never experienced before. Her hematocrit levels are currently stable, but she needs to be monitored closely while starting warfarin.
3. BRBPR (Blood-Red Stool): The patient has a history of BRBPR but never any gross lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She has never had a colonoscopy, so it is suggested to monitor her guaiac stool, hematocrit, and consider outpatient colonoscopy and GI follow-up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement post-procedure.

The patient has been receiving anticoagulation therapy with integrillin and heparin, as well as antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. She is also on beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, or throat. Her cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and"

   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm.  Due to a.fib yesterday she was
   loaded on amiodarone and converted back to sinus rhythm.  Overnight
   [**6-22**] had several brief episodes of a.fib at slower rhythms and then 30
   minutes when she first woke up of atrial flutter w/ HR in the 120s that
   resolved with Ativan to calm her.
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   - monitor on telemetry
   - consider EP input regarding a-flutter
   - cont ASA and Plavix
   - started on warfarin 2.5mg QD.

   HEMOPTYSIS: Patient with episode of hemoptysis . She has never
   experienced this before in the past. Hct currently stable.  Has been
   decreasing in quantity, but needs to be monitored closely while
   starting warfarin.
   - monitor resp status
   - follow Hct

   BRBPR: Patient has noted BRBPR in the past but never any gross lower GI
   bleeding. One of the reasons she has stopped taking ASA consistently is
   because she associates ASA with these episodes of BRBPR. Patient has
   never had a colonoscopy
   - guiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and received an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She is being monitored in the coronary care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and experienced episodes of atrial flutter during her stay in the ICU. It is important to continue monitoring her cardiac rhythm and consider further evaluation for possible electrophysiological (EP) study and treatment.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood. This could be a sign of a respiratory tract infection or bleeding disorder. Close monitoring of respiratory status and hematocrit levels is necessary, especially while starting warfarin therapy.
3. Bleeding risk: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR) and has stopped taking aspirin consistently due to its association with these episodes. It is important to monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit levels regularly and consider outpatient colonoscopy and gastrointestinal follow-up.
4. Fluid balance:"

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and received a bare-metal stent (BMS).

The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as anticoagulation with heparin. The patient's cardiac enzymes have normalized, but she continues to have elevated troponin T levels.

The patient has developed episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter, which have been managed with amiodarone and metoprolol. She has also been started on warfarin for anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), requiring balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain. She has undergone several interventions, including the use of integrillin and heparin, as well as oral medications such as clopidogrel, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient experienced episodes of AFib, which were converted back to sinus rhythm with the administration of amiodarone.
2. Flutter: The patient also had a brief episode of atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 120s, which resolved with Ativan.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient reported hemoptysis, although the quantity has been decreasing. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and follow her hematocrit levels closely.
4. BRBPR: The patient has a history of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) without gross lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be associated with her non-adherence to aspirin therapy.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.
- She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI.
- She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and received intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP).
- The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free.
- She has been on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as statin therapy with atorvastatin.
- The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter, which were converted back to sinus rhythm with amiodarone.
- She is scheduled for an electrophysiology (EP) study and ablation today.
- The patient has had an episode of hemoptysis, which has been decreasing in quantity but needs to be monitored closely while starting warfarin.
- She has a history of BRBPR (blood-tinged red brown stools) in the past and has not had a colonoscopy.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and pain management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

She has been hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free since the procedure. Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and heparin. The patient is being monitored on CCU telemetry and is expected to be transitioned to the floor today given her sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation: The patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation prior to conversion back to sinus rhythm with amiodarone. She should continue to be monitored for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, especially during the transition from IV to oral amiodarone.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced an episode of hemoptysis, which should be closely monitored, especially while starting warfarin. Regular monitoring of respiratory status and hematocrit levels is necessary.

3. BRBPR: The patient has a history of BRBPR (blood-tinged red brown stool) without any gross lower gastrointestinal"
