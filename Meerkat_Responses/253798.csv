   I received a phone call from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**] regarding the ECHO and he
   reported that the RV is dilated and hypokinetic and the LV has
   monoglobal hypokinesis.  Given this she will remain in the ICU for
   monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing symptoms and was found to have evidence of right heart strain on an EKG. The patient is currently on heparin gtt, and an echo has been ordered to assess for right heart strain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 127/90 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Heart Strain: The patient has evidence of right heart strain, which may be due to the extensive pulmonary emboli. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits at the moment, but bolus fluids may be required for blood pressure support.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has extensive pulmonary emboli, which indicates a high risk for DVT. Prophylaxis for DVT should be continued.
4. Stress Ulcer: Given the patient's critical condition, stress ulcer prophylaxis should be maintained to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU and receiving respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP. Adequate measures should be taken to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. She presented to the emergency department after experiencing leg pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia following a long bus ride. Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) were found upon evaluation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she does not require thrombolysis at the moment. She is being administered heparin through a gtt and has a troponin level of 0.08. No deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was detected in the lower extremities based on an ultrasound. An EKG was also performed.

24-hour events include an ultrasound and EKG, as well as changes in medication and vital signs. The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 36.9 degrees Celsius, and her current temperature is 36.6 degrees Celsius. Her heart rate ranges from 91 to 108 beats per minute, with a blood pressure of 133/96 mmHg. The respiratory rate is between 17 and 39 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. She is on nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she appears well-nourished, with normal eye and head examinations. Her cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and bilateral peripheral pulses present. The respiratory examination"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli, troponin leak, right ventricular dilation on echo, and a recent bus ride that likely precipitated the pulmonary embolism. She has undergone a trans-thoracic echo showing right ventricular dilation and global hypokinesis. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, and she is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient is a nonsmoker and has up-to-date cancer screening, including a tubulovillous adenoma from colonoscopy in [**2125-1-8**].

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/88 mmHg to 141/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has been on heparin since [**2126-11-2**] 08:02 PM.

   admitted with submassive PE with Echo showing RV HK. On heparin but not

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who presented with leg pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia after a long bus ride. She was found to have extensive bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with some fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. She requires moderate oxygen supplementation but does not need thrombolytics at this time. She is receiving heparin infusions and has shown improvement in her condition. The patient's troponin T levels are decreasing, indicating a positive response to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: Due to the extensive PEs, there is a risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient already shows signs of right ventricular hypokinesis with dilation on transthoracic echocardiography. If the right ventricle fails, it can result in hemodynamic instability and potentially death.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving heparin for anticoagulation, there is still a risk of developing new DVTs due to immobilization and other risk factors.
4. Prolonged Venous Thromboembolism: The patient's history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, along"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. She presented with leg pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia after a long bus ride. Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) were found, and she was sent to the emergency department. She is currently in the ICU, receiving heparin infusion and monitoring for RV failure. Her troponin T levels are decreasing, indicating improvement. She has a history of allergies to hydrochlorothiazide and is currently on a low-salt diet for fen. She requires ongoing respiratory support and close monitoring of her vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient already has extensive bilateral PEs, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular strain or failure, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Right Ventricular Failure (RVF): Due to the presence of PEs, the patient's right ventricle may fail, leading to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient has PEs, there is a risk of developing DVTs, which can lead to further clotting complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable but may drop if there is significant RV failure or other cardiovascular issues.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli, troponin leak, and right ventricular (RV) dilation on echo. She was admitted to the ICU due to tachycardia and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient's recent bus ride is suspected as the precipitant for her pulmonary emboli. She has a past medical history of tubulovillous adenoma from colonoscopy in 2015 and up-to-date cancer screening. The patient is a nonsmoker and not on any culprit medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli, which suggests a possible DVT. It is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms of DVT and consider appropriate prophylaxis measures.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's troponin leak indicates myocardial injury, and there are EKG changes suggestive of right heart strain. This raises concerns for ACS, and further evaluation with daily EKGs and consideration of CAD management is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range at present, but there is a mention of holding ACE inhibitors in the PUMP section. Monitoring for any changes in blood pressure and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently on telemetry for monitoring, and there"
