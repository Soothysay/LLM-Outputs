","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for chest pain. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous myocardial infarction. The patient is currently receiving treatment with albuterol and ipratropium nebs for wheezing, lasix 40 IV with good urine output, and has been started on heparin gtt and transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient is already on beta-blockers, statins, ASA, and Plavix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's elevated CK, MBI, and troponin levels suggest a possible ongoing myocardial infarction despite being on beta-blockers and other anti-ischemic medications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant loss of fluids, which could lead to acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Regular assessment for signs of VAP, such as fever, increased sputum production, and worsening gas exchange, should be performed"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Expand coverage for atypicals with Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Still volume
   overloaded, but significantly improved overnight.  Unclear what
   precipitated decompensation as patient reports good adherence to
   medication regimen and no clear dietary indiscretions.  Still, on
   conversation with family it seems patient has multiple stressors
   regarding husband's reluctance to make transition to [**Hospital3 59**]
   and likely suffered outside closely supervised environment of
   rehabilitation.  Finally, relative hypertension may have contributed to
   increased afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary
   edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue Amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 80 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of  1L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   -PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix for now
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold Isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold Hydralazine
   -Continue Amolodipine and Carvedilol, continue Clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI.
   -Iron studies
   -Guaiac stools
   -Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context of
   fluid overload.
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation. The patient also has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, acute kidney injury on CKD, and relative thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. NSTEMI: The patient's history of CAD and intermittent chest pain, along with elevated cardiac enzymes, suggest an ongoing myocardial ischemia. Continued management is required to prevent further cardiac events.
2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The presence of a right-sided infiltrate and worsening hypoxia indicates a possible pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but additional diagnostic information is needed to guide treatment.
3. Acute-on-chronic systolic CHF: The patient's volume overload and pulmonary edema require careful monitoring and management to prevent exacerbations.
4. Acute kidney injury on CKD: The patient's stage III-IV CKD at baseline, along with the 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio, suggests a pre-renal azotemia. Diuretic therapy and optimization of cardiac output are"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Expand coverage for atypicals with Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Still volume
   overloaded, but significantly improved overnight.  Unclear what
   precipitated decompensation as patient reports good adherence to
   medication regimen and no clear dietary indiscretions.  Still, on
   conversation with family it seems patient has multiple stressors
   regarding husband's reluctance to make transition to [**Hospital3 59**]
   and likely suffered outside closely supervised environment of
   rehabilitation.  Finally, relative hypertension may have contributed to
   increased afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary
   edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue Amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 80 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of  1L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   -PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix for now
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold Isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold Hydralazine
   -Continue Amolodipine and Carvedilol, continue Clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI.
   -Iron studies
   -Guaiac stools
   -Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context of
   fluid overload.
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She presents with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a heart failure exacerbation. She also has evidence of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) despite having flat cardiac enzymes and no chest pain. The patient has been started on beta-blockers, aspirin, statin, and heparin.

The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia, with right-sided infiltrate and consolidation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further diagnostic information is being obtained through sputum cultures.

The patient is still volume overloaded but significantly improved overnight. The precipitant of decompensation is unclear, but possible factors include non-adherence to medication regimen, stressors related to her husband's reluctance to transition to rehabilitation, and relative hypertension.

The patient has acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, likely due to pre-renal azotemia and poor forward flow. Diuresis and decreased congestion are expected to improve renal function, but other causes should be excluded.

The patient is in sinus rhythm and has no history of arrhythmia. Telemetry monitoring is continued.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is reasonably well-controlled, and insulin sliding scale is continued.

Hypertension management involves holding certain medications while continuing others to control blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, but NPO for now.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Currently
   appears volume overloaded.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as
   patient reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear
   dietary indiscretions.  Still, on conversation with family it seems
   patient has multiple stressors regarding husband's reluctance to make
   transition to [**Hospital3 59**] and likely suffered outside closely
   supervised environment of rehabilitation.  Also it sounds as if
   diuresis has been difficult to managed and has probably been decreased
   below optimal level.  Finally, possible that relative hypertension may
   have contributed to increased afterload and rapid development of more
   severe pulmonary edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACEi at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 40 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of [**2-12**].5 L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   -Sputum culture when possible
   -Cefepime (renally dosed) and vancomycin (dosed per level)
   -Chest PT
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Check urine lytes and eos this PM
   -Evening blood electrolytes to recheck for hyperkalemia
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and no records of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold hydralazine
   -Continue amolodipine and carvedilol, continue clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Ideally, transfusion may help with demand EKG changes but
   will hold for now given concern for TACO.
   -Iron studies (pt normocytic but Fe defic could be hidden in the
   setting of coexistent megaloblastic anemia).
   -Guiac stools
   -Transfuse if active chest pain, otherwise if still <25 in AM consider
   transfusing
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She is currently admitted to the ICU for dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with CHF exacerbation. The patient has right-sided consolidation, indicating health care-associated pneumonia. She also has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, which may have been precipitated by relative hypertension. There are concerns about acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by stage III-IV CKD at baseline and worsening of kidney function. The patient has a history of CAD and experienced an NSTEMI event, but cardiac enzymes were flat. She has diffuse ST changes on the EKG, but no chest pain. The patient has iron deficiency anemia and chronic inflammation, for which she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening health care-associated pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation and is being treated with antibiotics. Further monitoring and follow-up are necessary to assess the progression of the pneumonia.
2. Exacerbation of chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may worsen if not appropriately managed with diuretics and other medications. Close monitoring of fluid balance, oxygenation, and cardiac function is essential.

   CXR [**2168-3-3**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow despite absence of severe sCHF exacerbation, but may

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia. This is further supported by her recent hospital stay and worsening hypoxia. She is already receiving antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin), but a second sputum culture will be sent to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): Although the patient's cardiac enzymes were initially flat, she was ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, unchanged EKG, and no chest pain. She has a history of CAD and is being managed medically due to her poor candidacy for cardiac catheterization. The patient has been chest pain-free, and cardiac enzymes are trending down.

3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation does not fully align with an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF. Amlodipine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with a heart failure exacerbation.

Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray, which has not changed. Given her recent hospital stay and worsening hypoxia, she will continue with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. A sputum culture is pending, and a repeat chest X-ray is planned.
2. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presented with intermittent chest pain. Although cardiac enzymes were initially flat, she was ruled in for NSTEMI on [date]. She was started on blood thinners, aspirin, statin, and heparin. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she has been chest pain-free.
3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation does not align with an acute exacerbation of systolic congestive heart failure. Amlodipine was held, and she was restarted on home Imdur and Hydralazine.

   CXR [**2168-3-3**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. The patient presents with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which are consistent with a CHF exacerbation. Additionally, the patient has right-sided consolidation, suggesting a possible health care-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Worsening of CHF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, weight gain, and edema indicate an exacerbation of her chronic CHF. If not properly managed, this could lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of right-sided consolidation and worsening hypoxia suggests a possible health care-associated pneumonia. If left untreated, this infection could progress and potentially lead to sepsis.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on chronic kidney disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and is currently worsened. AKI is likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow, particularly given the 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio. If not addressed, this could further impair renal function.

4. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and intermittent chest pain, although cardiac enzymes were initially flat. Diffuse"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics and cardiac support. 

The vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in body temperature. The heart rate is stable, blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is within expected range, and oxygen saturation is good. 

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1956 mL and output of 1810 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 146 mL. This suggests that the patient has been receiving an adequate amount of fluids. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on high flow neb and has a good oxygen saturation level of 97%. 

The physical examination notes that peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments have not been conducted. 

Laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. The kidney function tests indicate a slightly elevated creatinine level. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, suggesting no ongoing myocardial infarction. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and blood gases are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities. 

The assessment and plan section mentions ongoing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with no immediate"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and Vancomycin (dosed
   per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**])
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu, f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s eval
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt
   was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow despite absence of severe sCHF exacerbation, but may
   have component present
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation. However, her chest CT showed bilateral consolidation, raising concern for health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to possible persistent aspirations and evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), given her presentation with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxia, and no evidence of heart failure. She has been placed on BiPAP and high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient also had elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but with no chest pain and improving enzymes, medical management has been continued.

She has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, but her cardiac team believes it is not an exacerbation. She has been restarted on her home regimen of beta-blockers, aspirin, and statin.

The patient has stage III-IV CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow. Diuretics have been initiated to manage fluid overload.

Other conditions include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and anemia. The"

","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was consistent with a CHF exacerbation. However, her chest CT showed bilateral consolidation (right greater than left), suggesting health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to her recent hospitalization. There is also evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections.

The patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for the pneumonia. Tamiflu has also been started for suspected influenza. BiPAP was used briefly for low PaO2 but tolerated well on high flow nasal cannula. O2 by facemask, frequent ABG, and follow-up pulmonary recommendations are planned.

Additionally, the patient is being treated for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with medical management due to her history of CAD. The plan is to continue beta-blockers, aspirin, and statin therapy. Heparin gtt was discontinued as the patient is not an ideal candidate for cardiac catheterization, and the bump in cardiac enzymes are likely secondary to the pulmonary process causing heart demand ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was consistent with a heart failure exacerbation. However, the patient's presentation did not meet the criteria for an acute exacerbation of systolic congestive heart failure. She was found to have bilateral consolidation on chest CT, raising concerns for health care-associated pneumonia. The patient also had evidence of tracheobronchomalacia and recurrent pulmonary infections. She was given broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral consolidation on chest CT suggests pneumonia. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriate, but the patient may develop complications such as worsening hypoxia, sepsis, or respiratory failure if the infection does not improve.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation with acute onset hypoxia, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, and the need for mechanical ventilation raises concerns for ARDS. She may develop further respiratory compromise and require advanced respiratory support.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: Despite the patient's history of coronary artery disease, cardiac enzymes were flat initially. However, there were diffuse ST changes on EKG, and she was ruled in for"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative. Patient reports that she
   chokes every time she drinks water and her chest CT would be consistent
   with persistent aspirations.  Also, patient has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent
   pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral
   flora. Patient with significant improvement in breathing and energy
   this AM. ABG stable on less FiO2 and CXR demonstrates interval
   improvement.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - Repeat TTE s/p NSTEMI as an inpatient
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Given worsening renal function and elevated BUN, consider renal
   consult & touch base with patient
s outpatient PCP
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down today after stable Hct on [**3-5**]. Hct this morning is 23.4.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC

   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with a CHF exacerbation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT, negative flu swab, and evidence of tracheobronchomalacia. There is improvement in breathing and energy, and ABG stability on reduced FiO2.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and intermittent chest pain. Elevated cardiac enzymes were noted, although unchanged EKG and no chest pain. The patient is being managed medically due to unintervenable CAD.
3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation does not indicate an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline. The initial elevation in BUN was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow. Urine electrolytes are consistent with pre-renal etiology.
5. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has no history of arrhythmia.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation. The patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections. She is currently in the ICU due to multiple comorbidities and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and reports choking while drinking water, raising concerns for persistent aspirations. Her chest CT is consistent with persistent aspirations. Given her recent stay in another hospital and worsening hypoxia this morning, she will continue on Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin. Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as breathing improved with Ativan.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and has had intermittent chest pain, though cardiac enzymes were flat. Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes were thought to be related to demand in the setting of known, unintervenable CAD, but the patient was ruled in on [date] with elevated enzymes, unchanged EKG, and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin g"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been experiencing wheezing and has had multiple changes in medications, including decreased Carvedilol from 50mg to 25mg, started on Captopril 6.25mg TID, and started on omeprazole for presumed GI bleed. The patient also received flu swab, sputum culture, and antibiotic therapy (Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Cefepime). The patient's heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 92%. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, Vasotec (Oral), Cortisporin (Otic), Ciloxan (Ophthalmic), and Atenolol. The patient is on various ICU medications, including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and insulin sliding scale with NPH. The patient's weight is 92.4 kg, height is 62 inches, and the total fluid input is 1,436 mL, with a net +500cc at 3pm. The patient received Lasix 40 IV x 1 and still had a net +400cc at 11:30pm, so they received Lasix 80 IV x 1. The patient's Hct is stable at 24.3. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was given at 10:00 AM. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are provided. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH and low carbon dioxide level. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed. The patient's family meeting was held yesterday without any recommendations. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation level and abnormal ABG results indicate a potential respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive culture results suggest a possible infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance and the administration of Lasix indicate a concern for fluid overload.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests (elevated creatinine and BUN) may suggest kidney dysfunction.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests (elevated ALT and AST) may indicate liver dysfunction.
6. Cardiac issues: The patient's low blood pressure and abnormal electrolyte levels (low sodium and potassium) may suggest cardiac issues.
7. GI bleed: The patient's use of o"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative. Patient reports that she
   chokes every time she drinks water and her chest CT would be consistent
   with persistent aspirations.  Also, patient has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent
   pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral
   flora. Patient with significant improvement in breathing and energy
   this AM. ABG stable on less FiO2 and CXR demonstrates interval
   improvement.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - Repeat TTE s/p NSTEMI as an inpatient
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Given worsening renal function and elevated BUN, consider renal
   consult & touch base with patient
s outpatient PCP
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation. She also has evidence of health care-associated pneumonia, tracheobronchomalacia, and is at risk for recurrent pulmonary infections. She was ruled in for NSTEMI, but cardiac enzymes are trending down and she is chest pain-free. She has acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and her baseline kidney function is stage III-IV CKD. Other conditions include rhythm (in sinus rhythm), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and anemia (iron deficiency and chronic inflammation).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and is at risk for recurrent pulmonary infections due to tracheobronchomalacia. She may require continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for improvement.
2. NSTEMI: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down and she is chest pain-free, there is still a risk of further cardiac complications. Monitoring for signs of worsening chest pain, arrhythmias, and ongoing cardiac enzyme elevation is important.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, weight gain, and lower extremity edema suggest exacerb"

   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - s/s eval today
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin

   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was consistent with a CHF exacerbation. However, her cardiac enzymes were flat, and diffuse ST changes were observed on an electrocardiogram (EKG). She was ruled in for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, unchanged EKG, and no chest pain. The patient is currently improving clinically with bilateral consolidation on chest CT, indicating pneumonia. She also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral consolidation on chest CT, indicating pneumonia. She has been prescribed antibiotics and is being closely monitored for clinical improvement.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has been ruled in for NSTEMI due to elevated cardiac enzymes, diffuse ST changes on EKG, and a history of CAD. She has been managed medically and is currently asymptomatic.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation does not align with an acute exacerbation of CHF. However"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with CHF exacerbation. The patient also has bilateral consolidation on chest CT, suggesting pneumonia, and evidence of tracheobronchomalacia. She has a history of NSTEMI and is being managed medically due to her poor candidacy for cardiac catheterization. The patient has stage III-IV CKD and anemia due to iron deficiency and chronic inflammation. She is currently receiving supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral consolidation on chest CT indicates pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis if not treated effectively.
2) Recurrent Pulmonary Infections: The patient's tracheobronchomalacia predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections, which can further compromise her respiratory status.
3) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's CKD and the recent episode of AKI may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
4) Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and worsening fatigue.
5) Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes management requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels, and there is a risk of hypogly"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - F/u repeat TTE
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down the next morning.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine, Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1
   PO BID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She is currently in the ICU for dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned include:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral consolidation on chest CT and recurrent pulmonary infections due to tracheobronchomalacia. This increases the risk of developing healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and presents with intermittent chest pain. Although cardiac enzymes were initially flat, the patient was ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes. This increases the risk of myocardial ischemia and potential complications such as recurrent NSTEMI or heart failure.
3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation is not consistent with an acute exacerbation of sCHF according to Dr. [**First Name (STitle)**]. However, there is ongoing management for chronic CHF symptoms, which includes monitoring fluid balance, optimizing medications, and ensuring adequate oxygenation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - s/s eval today
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, plavix
   - F/u repeat TTE
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   - TTE today
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - IV lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.
   last colonoscopy in [**2162**]
   - Guaiac stools

   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with a CHF exacerbation. She also has a health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and is being treated with antibiotics. Additionally, she had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but is not a candidate for cardiac catheterization. The patient's renal function is impaired, and she has iron deficiency anemia. Her current medications include carvedilol, ASA, statin, heparin, imdur/hydralazine, captopril, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral consolidation on chest CT, indicating a possible pneumonia. The patient's aspiration risk is high due to tracheobronchomalacia, which can lead to recurrent pulmonary infections.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, weight gain, and edema suggest an exacerbation of her CHF. Poor forward flow can lead to renal dysfunction and worsening heart failure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD and is currently back to baseline. Pr"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically on
   broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2 requirement in the
   context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen isolated with sputum
   culture due to contamination.  Bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest
   CT also consistent with persistent aspirations, but S&S evaluation on
   [**3-7**] was without clinically significant aspiration.  Patient also has
   evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent
   pulmonary infection.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 6
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix

   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of Lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to be effective in diuresis.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine, Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration.  Patient also has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary
   infection.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 6
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - F/U S&S video evaluation
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  This was then held again when started on ACE.
   - Continue ASA, Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] need for Imdur/Hydralazine before restarting
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1 PO BID, Captopril

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which were consistent with COPD and systolic CHF exacerbation. The patient has been diagnosed with health care-associated pneumonia/respiratory distress, acute on chronic systolic CHF, NSTEMI, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, anemia, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization and bed rest may lead to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Inadequate glycemic control could result in hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Inadequate fluid balance management may lead to fluid overload or dehydration.
4. Failure to manage the patient's anemia could result in worsening ischemia.
5. Improper management of hypertension may lead to recurrent episodes of elevated blood pressure.
6. Inadequate control of pain or discomfort could lead to agitation or delirium.
7. Inadequate monitoring of the patient's cardiac status may result in worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Poor nutritional support may contribute to malnutrition and delayed wound healing.
9. Inadequate infection control measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria
   for ARDS. She continues to improve on abx and reduce O2 requirement.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration. Video swallow reinforced need for precautions
   but unalarming.  Patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia,
   predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary infection. Patient briefly met
   criteria for ARDS.
   - continue to Wean O2, now at 4L NC
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 7
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - aspiration precautions
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN. Heartrate
   control between 53-77 on [**3-8**]
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  This was then held again when started on ACE.
   - Continue ASA, Captopril 6.25mg PO TID. In the setting of hypotension,
   might consider lower rose (2.5 of ramipril?)
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg with ascorbic acid daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - ideal Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in
   context of fluid overload and red cell consumption
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Control may
   be overshot.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1 PO BID, Captopril
   6.25mg TID
   .
   9) Disposition: SW has been helpful in organizing family. Patient needs
   rehab on d/c and unlikely to adequately care for self at home

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. She presented with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which were consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and systolic CHF exacerbation.

The patient was found to have multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently improving on broad-spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing oxygen requirement. Bilateral consolidation on chest CT is consistent with persistent aspirations, but bedside evaluation shows no clinically significant aspiration. Video swallow reinforced the need for precautions, although it was unalarming. The patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary infections.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to her pneumonia and tracheobronchomalacia. Weaning off oxygen and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics will be important to prevent further complications.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and was previously ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**] with elevated enzymes. She should continue to be monitored for any signs of ischemia"
