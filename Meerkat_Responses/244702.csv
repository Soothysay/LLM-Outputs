","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, gastrointestinal bleed, and likely reactive leukocytosis. The patient presents with renal insufficiency of unknown chronicity. 

The assessment and plan section outlines four main issues: NSTEMI, gastrointestinal bleed, leukocytosis, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

1. NSTEMI: The patient has a two-day history of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The EKG shows no ST elevations, and the first set of cardiac enzymes show CK 1874, CK-MB 32, Trop-T 0.23, which is consistent with NSTEMI. The cause of ischemia is unclear, but it may have been precipitated by anemia. The patient received ASA 325mg, and Clopidogrel (Plavix) should be held due to the GI bleed. Aspirin should be started, along with Atorvastatin 80mg. A lipid panel should be checked, and a catheterization will likely be needed.

2. GI Bleed: The patient is hemodynamically stable, with an unclear source of the bleed (upper or lower). Guaiac positive results indicate the presence of blood in the stool. The HCT in the ER was 23.5, which could have caused secondary ischemia. The GI physician recommends holding off on the scope in the setting of N"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/40 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur, but no other significant abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, indicating myocardial injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient is currently receiving aspirin, atorvastatin, and proton pump inhibitor therapy.

The patient's current medications include ASA 325mg, Lipitor 80mg, and Protonix IV. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at this time.

Based on the patient's presentation and history, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to further anemia and hypotension.
2. Development of acute kidney injury due to hypotension and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Progression of myocardial injury and potential development of heart failure.
4. Development of deep"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, likely caused by demand ischemia from a GI bleed. The patient's cardiac enzymes are consistent with NSTEMI.
- The patient has renal insufficiency of unknown chronicity, with elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible reactive leukocytosis.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.6 g/dL, which is low and could contribute to anemia.
- The patient has an infection with positive results for leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low magnesium levels.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are relatively stable, but there is a mention of possible hypotension.
- The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.
- The patient has a holosystolic murmur but no signs of congestive heart failure.
- The patient's abdominal exam is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
- The patient has excoriated lesions on the skin in different stages of healing.
- The patient's arterial blood gas values are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including myocardial infarction (MI), cocaine use, possible dermatomyositis, and renal insufficiency. The patient presented with NSTEMI, likely secondary to cocaine use and GI bleed. He has had a significant increase in creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating possible cocaine-induced myocardial injury or dermatomyositis. The patient's coronary anatomy is unknown, and his ischemia may have been precipitated by anemia of unclear etiology. The patient was started on aspirin, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient has shown signs of NSTEMI, which is a type of heart attack. This condition can lead to further damage to the heart muscle if not properly managed.
2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can potentially worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Cocaine Use: The patient's cocaine use poses a risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and exacerbation of his existing medical conditions.
4. Dermatomyositis: Although the diagnosis is unclear, the patient's elevated CK levels may suggest dermatomyositis. If confirmed, this condition can cause muscle weakness and other systemic manifestations.
5. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed could recur, leading to further blood loss and potential"

   ECHO:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild valvular mitral
   stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Severe pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-12**], the
   findings are similar with multi-valvular rheumatic heart disease. The
   left ventricular function remains hyperdynamic with no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia from GI bleed and
   cocaine use, likely reactive leukocytosis, presenting with renal
   insufficiency of unknown chronicity and CK elevations.
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Patient with 2 day history of dyspnea and chest discomfort.
   EKG shows no ST elevations, no tracing for comparison.  Patient's 1st
   set of cardiac enzymes showed CK 1874, CK-MB 32, Trop-T 0.23,
   consistent with NSTEMI.  Dramatic CK elevation suggestive of cocaine
   use but may represent dermatomyositis.  Cath on [**2183-8-18**] with 30% LMCA
   and RCA stenosis, ischemia may have been precipitated by anemia,
   unclear etiology.  Pt received ASA 325mg.  CE trending down.
   - In setting GI bleed, hold on plavix or BB
   - aspirin, Atorvastatin 80mg
   - Lipid panel shows low risk.
   - Cath does not indicated given no new chest pain or EKG changes and
   recent clean cath.
   .
   # GI Bleed:  Hemodynamically stable.  Unclear if upper or lower.  Guiac
   positive.  HCT in ER 23.5, may have cause secondary ischemia.  GI saw
   patient in ER and recommending holding off scope in setting of NSTEMI.
   Recommended transfusing patient as needed.  Transfused 2u PRBCs plus 1u
   more.  Now stable Hct.  OSH colonoscopy with AVMs, polyps, known recent
   GI bleed.
   -PO  Protonix
   -No scope for now given NSTEMI
   .
   # Dermatomyositis: Unclear basis for this diagnosis.  No evidence of
   biopsy.  Would consider restarting prednisone if CK remain persistently
   high.
   .
   # Zoster: neurontin 300 mg.
   .
   # Cocaine use:  Patient was counseled about the cardiac dangers of this
   drug.  Denies use.
   - SW c/s
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC 17.2, 23.2 yesterday at PCP's office.  Patient
   afebrile.  VSS.  BC pending, U/A negative, Lactate 1.0.
   - Monitor temps
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow.  Cr improving.  FENA 1.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Monitor Creatinine
   .
   # Plan of care:  Patient would likely be better served at [**Hospital1 12**] where he
   is well known and has all medical records.  Will attempt to initiate
   transfer according to patient

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, GI bleed, cocaine use, renal insufficiency, and elevated CK levels. He presents with dyspnea and chest discomfort. EKG shows no ST elevations, but cardiac enzymes show elevated CK and troponin levels, consistent with NSTEMI. The patient has a history of multi-valvular rheumatic heart disease, with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. He also has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and severe pulmonic regurgitation. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. His leukocyte count is elevated, likely due to a reactive response. The patient has a history of anemia and is currently receiving aspirin and atorvastatin. 

The patient's current plan of care includes monitoring his vital signs, renal function, and electrolyte levels. He will be managed with DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and bowel regimen. The patient is expected to improve with medical management and may benefit from transfer to another hospital for further care."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, likely secondary to demand ischemia from a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and cocaine use. The patient also has renal insufficiency of unknown chronicity and elevated CK levels.

The patient presented with dyspnea and chest discomfort, and an EKG showed no ST elevations. The initial cardiac enzymes showed a CK level of 1874, CK-MB of 32, and Troponin-T of 0.23, which are consistent with NSTEMI. The dramatic CK elevation may suggest cocaine use or dermatomyositis. The patient's coronary anatomy is unknown, and the ischemia may have been precipitated by anemia.

The patient received aspirin (ASA) 325mg, and the decision was made to hold on Plavix or beta-blockers in the setting of GI bleed. Atorvastatin 80mg was started, and a lipid panel showed low risk. A catheterization was deemed inappropriate given the patient's multiple complex medical issues currently being managed at [**Hospital1 12**].

The patient was found to have a GI bleed, which is unclear whether it is an upper or lower bleed. The patient tested positive for guaiac, and the hematocrit (HCT) in the emergency room was 23.5, potentially causing secondary ischemia. The patient received 2 units of packed"
