   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis: VS now stable.  Likely source of infection is lung.  Patient
   has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on
   exam, sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia,
   and abnormal CXR are consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover broadly
   given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.  Also
   has decub ulcer.
   - follow up blood  and urine culture
   -  sputum culture pending
   - renally dosed IV  vancomycin and meropenem, Also Flagyl and PO vanco
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - AM CXR stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). 

The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The likely source of infection is the lungs, as indicated by crackles on examination, sputum production from tracheal suction, leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia. The patient has known MRSA and klebsiella infections in the past, which need to be covered broadly due to recent treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient also has a decubitus ulcer and requires follow-up blood and urine cultures, as well as sputum culture pending. Renally dosed IV vancomycin and meropenem are being administered, along with Flagyl and oral vancomycin. The patient's intravenous fluids (IVF) will be managed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (vent) support and has hypoxia most likely due to PNA. Weaning down FiO2 and RR as tolerated is planned, and vanc/meropen"

   - renally dosed vancomycin and meropenem
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - AM CXR to look for any rapid change, could consider bronch to look at
   the left lower lobe for possible source of atelactasis/specimen for
   culture

   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis and recent midazolam.  Could
   consider rescanning the head if it does not improve with treatment.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating well on vent
   support.

   - careful IVF to treat sepsis
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (ESRD/HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past, which indicates a likely source of infection. Given the recent treatment with vancomycin and meropenem, broad coverage is needed. Additionally, the patient has decubitus ulcers, which can also serve as a potential source of infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support, and hypoxia is most likely due to pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to adjust ventilator settings and ensure adequate gas exchange.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest impaired renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is crucial. Renal dosing of medications like vancomycin and meropenem should be considered.

4. Chronic Heart Failure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Likely source of infection is lung.  Patient has known
   pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam,
   sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and
   abnormal CXR are consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover broadly given
   recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.  Also has
   decub ulcer.
   - follow up blood culture
   - send sputum culture
   - will send for UA/UCX given that patient makes some urine
   - renally dosed vancomycin and meropenem
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - AM CXR to look for any rapid change, could consider bronch to look at
   the left lower lobe for possible source of atelactasis/specimen for
   culture
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis and recent midazolam.  Could
   consider rescanning the head if it does not improve with treatment.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating well on vent
   support.
   - vanc/meropenem till culture and sensitivity comes back
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   - careful IVF to treat sepsis
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis likely due to a lung infection. There is a need to cover broadly given recent antibiotic treatment and hospitalization.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has known MRSA and klebsiella pneumonia in the past. There are crackles on examination, sputum production from tracheostomy suction, leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a severe form of lung inflammation that can lead to respiratory collapse.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current renal failure may worsen due to sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer which requires ongoing wound care and prevention of further pressure ulcers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. He presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray findings, indicating pneumonia as the likely source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated based on recent treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to hypoxia, which is most likely caused by pneumonia. Weaning off FiO2 and RR should be done carefully as tolerated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis or recent medication use. Renal dosing of medications should be considered.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to sepsis and recent midazolam administration. Monitoring and supportive care should be provided.
5. Thrush: The patient is at risk for thrush due to prolonged intubation and antibiotic use. Surveillance and appropriate treatment should be considered.
6. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular turning and wound"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis: VS now stable except for fever.  Likely aspiration pneumonia,
   especially now with 3x GNR growing from sputum culture.  Patient has
   known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam,
   sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and
   abnormal CXR are all also consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover
   broadly given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.
   Also has decub ulcer and diarrhea. Cdiff negative x2.
   - 1 additional CDiff
   - follow up blood, urine, sputum culture
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for pneumonia, vancomycin for bacteremia
   from decub ulcer,  IV Flagyl and PO vanco for Cdiff
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on reduced vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.
   -          vanc/meropenem until culture and sensitivity comes back
   -          ABGs with respiratory alk, continue to wean down FiO2 and RR
   as tolerated
 consider changing to PSV today.
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   -          careful IVF to treat sepsis
   -          on B-blocker
   -          re-start ASA and [**Last Name (un) 284**] vs Hydralizine/Imdur (as per
   nephrology) if BP remains stable, restart statin
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Tropinin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   - optimize CHF medications
   .
   # ESRD/HD:  next dialysis scheduled for tomorrow unless otherwise
   indicated in the next 24h.
   -          renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Hydral/imdur over [**Last Name (un) 284**]/ACE for CHF treatment optimization
   .
   # Diarrhea: Elevated WBC and bandemia.  Recent antibiotics.  Needs to
   rule out c diff.
   - c diff neg x2, resent.
   - oral vanc and flagyl until 3x negative (b/c of high pre-test
   probability for Cdiff)
   .
   # Decubitus ulcer:  Improving per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] nursing stage 3
   -          appreciate wound care recs
   -          flexocele to limit contribution
   .
   # R flank rash: exam c/w zoster, although patient does not express pain
   (admittedly difficult to properly assess).
   - zoster precautions for staff

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been admitted with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past. He now has three different types of Gram-negative rods (GNR) growing from sputum culture. This indicates a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or a relapse of previous infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed to cover these organisms.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has diarrhea, elevated white blood cell count, and bandemia. These symptoms are consistent with C. diff infection. Although the patient is currently negative for C. diff, he should be followed up with repeat testing and treated empirically with oral vancomycin and metronidazole.

3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 3 decubitus ulcer, which is worsening due to fecal contamination. Measures should"

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, with a secondary complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and acute renal failure, with a recent increase in serum creatinine levels. There are also signs of infection, indicated by the presence of fever and positive cultures for GNR (Gram-negative rods).

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole, meropenem, and vancomycin. Additionally, the patient has been on lansoprazole (Prevacid) for gastric protection.

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure and heart rate but an elevated respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 99% on the ventilator. The patient has a slight decrease in urine output.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 32.5 K/uL. The platelet count is within normal limits. There are abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated levels of total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Electrolyte imbalances are present, with hyperkalemia (high potassium level) and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium level). Renal function tests show an increase in serum creatinine.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis: VS now stable.  Likely source of infection is lung.  Patient
   has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on
   exam, sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia,
   and abnormal CXR are consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover broadly
   given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.  Also
   has decub ulcer.
   - follow up blood  and urine culture
   -  sputum culture pending
   - renally dosed IV  vancomycin and meropenem, Also Flagyl and PO vanco
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - AM CXR stable
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis and recent midazolam.  Now
   responding to family. Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating well on vent
   support.
   -          vanc/meropenem till culture and sensitivity comes back
   -          ABG with respiratory alk, continue to wean down FiO2 and RR
   as tolerated
   .
   # Thrush:  Unable to follow swish and swallow directions therefore
   started on PO fluconazole.
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   - careful IVF to treat sepsis
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   - CK flat. Tropinin increase [**12-23**] renal failure.
   .
   # ESRD/HD:  Last dialysis yesterday.
   -          renal following
   -          will ask about repleting phos
   .
   # Diarrhea: Elevated WBC and bandemia.  Recent antibiotics.  Needs to
   rule out c diff.
   - c diff neg x1, resent.
   - oral vanc and flagyl
   .
   # Decubitus ulcer:  Improving per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] nursing stage 3
   - appreciate wound care recs
   .
   # Access: PIV x3, R subclavian HD acess, R a- line. To have mid line
   placed today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia. Broad coverage is needed due to previous treatment with vancomycin and cefepime. The source of infection is likely the lungs, and the patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past. Monitoring blood and urine cultures, sputum culture, and adjusting antibiotics accordingly is crucial.

2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to sepsis and recent midazolam administration. Close monitoring is necessary to assess any changes in mental status.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to pneumonia. Current oxygen saturation is well maintained on ventilator support. Weaning down FiO2 and RR as tolerated is recommended. ABG analysis should be continued"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 40.5 kg, 61-inch male who is currently admitted to the MICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he is experiencing tachypnea in the 40's. The patient has been moved from the general floor to the MICU due to his unstable condition.

The patient has been started on ASA and a statin. There is a recommendation from nephrology to initiate hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow and use hydral and isordyl in place of [**Last Name (un) 284**]/ACE to protect the kidneys. The patient is also being considered for a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient has experienced small amounts of blood from the trachea overnight. The patient's allergies include heparin agents, but the specific type is unknown. The last doses of antibiotics administered were meropenem on 2187-10-28 at 04:38 AM, metronidazole on 2187-10-29 at 02:00 AM, and vancomycin on 2187-10-29 at 04:00 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (ESRD/HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). He presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past, and current findings suggest aspiration pneumonia, including crackles on exam, sputum production from tracheal suction, leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray. The patient also has decubitus ulcers and diarrhea, but Clostridium difficile (C-diff) has been negative twice. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a widespread infection that causes systemic inflammation. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to pneumonia and poor cardiac function. Weaning off the ventilator and adjusting FiO2 as tolerated will be important in managing this complication.
3. CHF: The patient has systolic CHF with reduced ejection fraction. Optimizing heart failure medications and managing fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis: VS now stable except for fever.  Likely aspiration pneumonia,
   especially now with 3x GNR growing from sputum culture.  Patient has
   known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam,
   sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and
   abnormal CXR are all also consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover
   broadly given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.
   Also has decub ulcer and diarrhea. Cdiff negative x2.
   - 1 additional CDiff
   - follow up blood, urine, sputum culture
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for pneumonia, vancomycin for bacteremia
   from decub ulcer,  IV Flagyl and PO vanco for Cdiff
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on reduced vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.
   -          vanc/meropenem until culture and sensitivity comes back
   -          ABGs with respiratory alk, continue to wean down FiO2 and RR
   as tolerated
 consider changing to PSV today.
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   -          careful IVF to treat sepsis
   -          on B-blocker
   -          re-start ASA and [**Last Name (un) 284**] vs Hydralizine/Imdur (as per
   nephrology) if BP remains stable, restart statin
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Tropinin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   - optimize CHF medications
   .
   # ESRD/HD:  next dialysis scheduled for tomorrow unless otherwise
   indicated in the next 24h.
   -          renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Hydral/imdur over [**Last Name (un) 284**]/ACE for CHF treatment optimization
   .
   # Diarrhea: Elevated WBC and bandemia.  Recent antibiotics.  Needs to
   rule out c diff.
   - c diff neg x2, resent.
   - oral vanc and flagyl until 3x negative (b/c of high pre-test
   probability for Cdiff)
   .
   # Decubitus ulcer:  Improving per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] nursing stage 3
   -          appreciate wound care recs
   -          flexocele to limit contribution
   .
   # R flank rash: exam c/w zoster, although patient does not express pain
   (admittedly difficult to properly assess).
   - zoster precautions for staff
   .
   # Access: PIV x3, R subclavian HD acess, R a- line. To IR for picc
   tomorrow(?)
   .
   # FEN: TF restarted as per nutrition
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, PPI.
   .
   # Code: Full code, no central lines after discussing with family (wife

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and administer appropriate antibiotics.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms such as cough, fever, and worsening respiratory status is essential.

3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 3 decubitus ulcer, which requires regular turning, wound care, and prevention of fecal contamination to promote healing and prevent further complications.

4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, increasing the risk of developing C. diff infection. Monitoring for symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain is necessary.

5. Hypoxia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 10-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and decubitus ulcer. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and increased sputum production since the placement of a PICC line. He has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and renal nutrition. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but he has elevated white blood cell count and abnormal blood chemistry results. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination are not assessed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis progression: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bronchospasm.
3. Renal function deterioration: The patient's acute renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate compromised kidney function. Continued deterioration could lead to further renal impairment and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Pressure injury progression: The presence of a decubitus ulcer at admission suggests poor skin integrity. Without appropriate pressure relief and wound care, the ulcer may worsen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
   # Sepsis: VS now stable except for fever.  Likely aspiration pneumonia,
   especially now with 3x GNR growing from sputum culture.  Patient has
   known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam,
   sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and
   abnormal CXR are all also consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover
   broadly given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.
    Also has decub ulcer and diarrhea. Cdiff negative x2.
   - 1 additional CDiff
   - follow up blood, urine, sputum culture
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for pneumonia, vancomycin for bacteremia
   from decub ulcer,  IV Flagyl and PO vanco for Cdiff
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on reduced vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.
   -          vanc/meropenem until culture and sensitivity comes back
   -          ABGs with respiratory alk, continue to wean down FiO2 and RR
   as tolerated
 consider changing to PSV today.
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   -          careful IVF to treat sepsis
   -          on B-blocker
   -          re-start ASA and [**Last Name (un) 284**] vs Hydralizine/Imdur (as per
   nephrology) if BP remains stable, restart statin
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Tropinin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   - optimize CHF medications
   .
   # ESRD/HD:  next dialysis scheduled for tomorrow unless otherwise
   indicated in the next 24h.
   -          renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Hydral/imdur over [**Last Name (un) 284**]/ACE for CHF treatment optimization
   .
   # Diarrhea: Elevated WBC and bandemia.  Recent antibiotics.  Needs to
   rule out c diff.
   - c diff neg x2, resent.
   - oral vanc and flagyl until 3x negative (b/c of high pre-test
   probability for Cdiff)
   .
   # Decubitus ulcer:  Improving per daughter. [**Name (NI) **] nursing stage 3
   -          appreciate wound care recs
   -          flexocele to limit contribution
   .
   # R flank rash: exam c/w zoster, although patient does not express pain
   (admittedly difficult to properly assess).
   - zoster precautions for staff
   .
   # Access: PIV x3, R subclavian HD acess, R a- line. To IR for picc
   tomorrow(?)

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of infection with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and may worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to further complications such as hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.

4. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis. Chronic renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and anemia.

5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to antibiotic-associated colitis or Clostridium difficile infection. This can result in dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.

6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer, which is a pressure sore caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. This can lead to infection and potential complications if not properly managed.

7. Herpes zoster: The patient has a rash consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by reactivation of the"

   # Sepsis: VS now stable except for fever.  Likely aspiration pneumonia,
   especially now with 3x GNR growing from sputum culture.  Patient has
   known pneumonia with MRSA and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam,
   sputum production from trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and
   abnormal CXR are all also consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover
   broadly given recent treatment with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.
   Also has decub ulcer and diarrhea. Cdiff negative x2.
   - 1 additional CDiff
   - follow up blood, urine, sputum culture
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for pneumonia, vancomycin for bacteremia
   from decub ulcer,  IV Flagyl and PO vanco for Cdiff
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for pneumonia and vancomycin for bacteremia from a decubitus ulcer. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and provide appropriate care.

3. Hypoxia: The patient was experiencing hypoxia, which is most likely due to pneumonia. The patient is currently saturating well on reduced ventilator support, and efforts should be made to wean down FiO2 and RR as tolerated.

4. Thrush: The patient has thrush, which requires treatment with nystatin swish and suction.

5. CHF: The patient has chronic heart failure, and careful intravenous fluid management should be maintained. Optimization of CHF medications is recommended"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has a fever, likely aspiration pneumonia, and positive cultures for GNR. He also has leukocytosis, bandemia, and an abnormal chest X-ray, all of which are consistent with pneumonia. Given his recent treatment with vancomycin and cefepime, as well as hospitalization, broad-spectrum coverage is needed. The patient also has decubitus ulcers and diarrhea.

2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has hypoxia, most likely due to PNA. He is currently well-saturated on ventilator support but has a poor ejection fraction. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously.

3. Thrush: The patient has thrush, which needs to be treated with nystatin swish and suction.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Continued fever.  Likely aspiration pneumonia, especially now with 3x
   GNR growing from sputum culture.  Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA
   and klebsiella in the past.  Crakles on exam, sputum production from
   trach suction, leukocytosis, bandermia, and abnormal CXR are all also
   consistent with pneumonia. Need to cover broadly given recent treatment
   with vanc/cefepime and hospitalization.  Also has decub ulcer and
   diarrhea. Cdiff negative x3.
   - follow up blood, urine, sputum culture
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem and for pneumonia
   - no evidence of GPC on culture, therefore d/ced vanco today
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - Overnight and again this afternoon pt with BP drops to SBP 70s.
   improves with repositioning. Lightly partially do to change in level of
   A-line. Given 250cc bolus overnight and rapidly improved to
   hypertensive range. Pt positive for LOS, and today, no fever or change
   in HR to suggest sepsis. We ESRD reluctant to bolus IVF. Continue to
   monitor BP
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
    Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.  Tolerated PS
   for few hours this afternoon. Continue to wean as tolerated
   -          meropenem until culture and sensitivity comes back
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  ? BNP of
   8000 at OSH.
   -          careful IVF as above
   -          on B-blocker
   -          re-started ASA and  Hydralizine/Imdur (as per nephrology) if
   BP remains stable, restart statin. Hold BP meds tomorrow am for HD. IF
   BP continues to fluctuate cut back on BP meds. However, prefer to keep
   BP low given poor EF.
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Tropinin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   -          optimize CHF medications
   -          ASA
   .
   # DM: Glucose widely fluctuating
 RENAL FAILURE,
   # ESRD/HD:  next dialysis scheduled for tomorrow.
   -          renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Hydral/imdur over [**Last Name (un) 284**]/ACE for CHF treatment optimization,
   holding tomorrow am.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He has been experiencing fever since the previous day, which is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The presence of crackles on examination, sputum production from tracheal suction, leukocytosis, bandemia, and abnormal chest X-ray all suggest pneumonia. The patient has a history of pneumonia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and klebsiella in the past.
- The patient also has a decubitus ulcer and diarrhea. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out three times.
- He is hypotensive with blood pressure (BP) in the 70s, which improves with repositioning and fluid resuscitation. There is concern for sepsis, but the patient's recent treatment with vancomycin and cefepime, along with hospitalization, warrants broad-spectrum coverage.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is resolving with ventilatory support. His poor ejection fraction likely contributes to this condition"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, chronic coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, decubitus ulcer, herpes zoster, and diarrhea. On admission, the patient presented with altered mental status, not delirium, and is currently on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/54 mmHg to 156/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,759 mL and output of 12 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,747 mL. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sepsis and presence of ESBL Klebsiella in sputum culture indicate a high risk of infection. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is essential.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation support, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular"

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. The patient presented with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure chronic, thrush, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure acute, decubitus ulcer, herpes zoster, and diarrhea. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.7°C to 37.4°C, heart rate between 66-87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/29 mmHg to 140/54 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's physical examination revealed pupils that were round and minimally reactive to light, distant heart sounds, coarse breath sounds bilaterally with louder sounds on the left side, presence of a PEG tube, an excoriated rash along an approximate T10 dermatome, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal kidney function tests. 

The patient's current plan of care includes continued meropen"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Continued fever.   Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella
   in the past.  Sputum culture shows Klebsiella which is sensitive to
   amikacin and meropenem. Fevers have largely subsided and WBC have
   decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely secondary to positioning of
   A-line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid responsive) so unlikely to be
   due to sepsis.
   - follow up pending cultures
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem
   - vanco d/c yesterday (level today 20.5)
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - monitor fluid status, today HD
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
    Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.  Tolerated PS
   for few hours this afternoon. Continue to wean as tolerated
   -          Continue meropenem
   -          Consult PT/OT
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  On HD to
   take off up to 4L today?
   -          careful IVF
   -          on B-blocker
   -          ASA.Hydralizine/Imdur. Consider restarting statin prior to
   d/c.
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Troponin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   -          optimize CHF medications
   -          ASA

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. He is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and herpes zoster.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella in the past. His current sputum culture shows Klebsiella which is sensitive to amikacin and meropenem. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is most likely due to pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and continued weaning of ventilatory support as tolerated is necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli and does not follow commands. Monitoring his neurological status and ensuring adequate sedation and pain management are essential.
4. Chronic heart failure: The patient's poor left ventricular ejection fraction contributes to his hypoxia. Optimization of heart failure medications and careful fluid management are crucial.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly are"

   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Continued fever.   Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella
   in the past. Known to have VRE in past.  [**10-27**] Sputum culture shows
   Klebsiella with 2 separate lines isolate which was originally both
   sensitive to amikacin and meropenem.  Called today that one line is
   likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin. Fevers had largely subsided
   and WBC have decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely secondary to
   positioning of A-line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid responsive) so
   unlikely to be due to sepsis.
   - ID called for ESBL resistant to meropenom and amikican
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for now, length of treatment with abx to
   be determined
   - Was on IV vanco from [**10-26**] to [**10-30**]. stoped [**10-30**] [**12-23**] lack of GPC on
   cult. However, today coag positive staph also added to [**10-27**] sputum,
   restart Vanco with HD protacol
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - monitor fluid status, today HD
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family
   yesterday. Continue to monitor.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
    Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.  Tolerated PS
   for few hours this afternoon. Continue to wean as tolerated
   -          Continue meropenem
   -          Consult PT/OT
   .
   # Thrush:  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
   # CHF:  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  On HD to
   take off up to 4L today?
   -          careful IVF
   -          on B-blocker
   -          ASA.Hydralizine/Imdur. Consider restarting statin prior to
   d/c.
   .
   # CAD: Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Troponin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. He presents with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. His vital signs are stable, but he requires careful fluid management due to his chronic heart failure. The patient's recent medical interventions include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). He has also undergone multiple hemodialysis sessions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures should be continued to prevent further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to COPD. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be"

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic CHF, CAD, acute renal failure, decubitus ulcer, herpes zoster, and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a recurrent PNA caused by MRSA and Klebsiella. It is crucial to monitor the patient's vital signs, maintain adequate fluid balance, and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to PNA and poor EF. Weaning off ventilator support should be done cautiously while ensuring oxygenation and ventilation parameters are within normal limits.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be related to sepsis, renal failure, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurological function is necessary.
4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic CHF with a low EF. Management includes optimizing CHF medications, monitoring fluid status, and considering adjustments in"

   likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin. Coag positive staph also
   added to [**10-27**] sputum.  Fevers had largely subsided and WBC have
   decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely secondary to positioning of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure (EF 20%), ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD)/hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia. The patient presented with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella in the past. The current sputum culture shows Klebsiella with two separate lines of antibiotic sensitivity, but one line is likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin. There is also coag positive staph added to the sputum culture.

The patient's recent blood pressure has been hypotensive, but this is believed to be due to positioning of the arterial line and/or post-HD hypotension rather than sepsis. The patient has a fever overnight, and there is a new spike in the fever curve. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from the 40s to 6.7. The patient's platelet count has decreased from 99 to 56. There are abnormal cells seen on the differential. The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 28.

The patient is now in atrial flutter, which may have been triggered by changes in fluid status/hypotension or the new infectious process. The patient has oral candidiasis, which"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, CHF, CAD, renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and herpes zoster.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate ranging from 66-89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/28 mmHg to 158/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's current rhythm is atrial flutter with variable block, and his weight is 39.5 kg.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 32 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, and potassium levels of 5.6 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Klebsiella, which is sensitive to amikacin and meropenem. The patient is currently receiving IV meropenem.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with saturation well maintained on ventilator support. The patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's fluid status is being monitored closely, with IV fluids administered to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient is also on hemodialysis and receiving nutrition through tube feeds.

The patient's decubitus ulcer is improving, and the patient is being monitored for worsening diarrhea. The patient's herpes zoster rash is present but without pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: Despite the patient's current improvement, there is still a risk of sepsis progressing to involve organs such as the kidneys or liver.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen if there are any complications related to the ventilator or if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not adequately managed.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may further deteriorate if there is inadequate management of fluid status or if the underlying cause of renal failure is not addressed.

4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer needs close monitoring for worsening or infection. Proper wound care and pressure relief measures should be continued.

5. Diarrhea: Although the patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved, monitoring for worsening diarrhea is essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, recurrent pneumonia, and chronic medication use. He presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has recurrent pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella infection, which has led to septic shock. There is a new spike in fever curve, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is not responding to verbal stimuli, opens eyes to voice but does not follow commands, and shows decreased reflexes in all four extremities. This could be secondary to sepsis or an underlying neurological condition.
3. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 20%). He is currently saturating well on ventilator support.
4. Thrombocytopenia, chronic: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing from 99 to 56, indicating chronic thrombocytopenia.
5. Anemia, chronic: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 28, indicating chronic anemia.
6. Heart failure, systolic, chronic: The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure, which may worsen due to his"

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with A&P as above
   by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2802**]. Temp trending down, and he is back in NSR, although now
   some episodes of brady likely due to Sick Sinus. No hypotension and
   will continue beta blockade for now. ID has evaluated Klebsiella
 for
   now holding on Colistin but organism sensitivity is very ominous.  BP
   more stable on HD recently.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   PT no longer febrile.   Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and
   Klebsiella in the past. Known to have VRE in past.  [**10-27**] Sputum culture
   shows Klebsiella with 2 separate lines isolate which was originally
   both sensitive to amikacin and meropenem.  Called [**11-1**] that one line
   is likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin, however it is not ESBL.
   Coag positive staph also added to [**10-27**] sputum.  Fevers have largely
   subsided and WBC have decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely
   secondary to positioning of A-line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid
   responsive) so unlikely to be due to sepsis. New fever overnight. Diff
   on CBC today with multiple abnormal WBCs
   - ID called for ESBL Klebs and Non ESBL klebs resistant to meropenom
   and amikican. ID questions whether practically the 2^nd Kleb is not
   really ESBL.
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for now, length of treatment with abx to
   be determined. Will await ID recs for the need for any additional abx.
   - Was on IV vanco from [**10-26**] to [**10-30**]. stoped [**10-30**] [**12-23**] lack of GPC on
   cult. However, yesterday  coag positive staph also added to [**10-27**]
   sputum, restarted Vanco with HD protocol. However missed dose until
   today because he had no HD only now.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella in the past and has also had VRE in the past. The recent sputum culture showed Klebsiella with two separate isolates, both originally sensitive to amikacin and meropenem. However, one line is likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin. Coag-positive staph has also been added to the sputum culture. The patient's fever has largely subsided, and the white blood cell count has decreased.

The patient's blood pressure has been stable on hemodialysis recently, but there have been some dips that are likely due to positioning of the arterial line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid responsive). A new fever overnight was reported, and there is a difference in the complete blood count with multiple abnormal white blood cells.

The patient is being treated with IV meropenem, and the ID is waiting for sensitivity results to determine if additional antibiotics are needed. The patient is also on IV vancomycin, which was previously stopped due to lack of growth of gram"

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with A&P as above
   by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2802**]. Temp trending down, and he is back in NSR, although now
   some episodes of brady likely due to Sick Sinus. No hypotension and
   will continue beta blockade for now. ID has evaluated Klebsiella
 for
   now holding on Colistin but organism sensitivity is very ominous.  BP
   more stable on HD recently.

   [**11-2**] Physical exam
   Gen:  Not responding to verbal stimuli. Opens eyes to voice but not
   following commands.
   HEENT:  Pupils round and minimally reactive to light, MMM
   Heart:  S1S2 RRR, distant heart sounds
   Lungs:  coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
   Abdomen:  PEG tube in place. + BS.  Soft ND. R sided excoriated rash
   along approx T 10 dermatome and not crossing midline anteriorly or
   posteriorly.  Rash stable without  further clear secretions from
   lesions, skin open on area or rash on back but covered, some areas of
   erythema but no active superinfection noted.
   Ext:  Sacral decubitus ulcer w/covering bandage.  No edema.
   Neuro:  Unresponsive to verbal stimuli, not following commands.
   Decreased reflexes all 4 extremities.

   .
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD, systolic CHF EF 20%, ischemic/hemorrhagic
   CVA, ESRD/HD, recurrent PNA presents with septic shock, respiratory
   failure and altered mental status.
   .
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   PT no longer febrile.   Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and
   Klebsiella in the past. Known to have VRE in past.  [**10-27**] Sputum culture
   shows Klebsiella with 2 separate lines isolate which was originally
   both sensitive to amikacin and meropenem.  Called [**11-1**] that one line
   is likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin, however it is not ESBL.
   Coag positive staph also added to [**10-27**] sputum.  Fevers have largely
   subsided and WBC have decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely
   secondary to positioning of A-line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid
   responsive) so unlikely to be due to sepsis. New fever overnight. Diff
   on CBC today with multiple abnormal WBCs
   - ID called for ESBL Klebs and Non ESBL klebs resistant to meropenom
   and amikican. ID questions whether practically the 2^nd Kleb is not
   really ESBL.
   - renally dosed IV  meropenem for now, length of treatment with abx to
   be determined. Will await ID recs for the need for any additional abx.
   - Was on IV vanco from [**10-26**] to [**10-30**]. stoped [**10-30**] [**12-23**] lack of GPC on
   cult. However, yesterday  coag positive staph also added to [**10-27**]
   sputum, restarted Vanco with HD protocol. However missed dose until
   today because he had no HD only now.
   - flexocele in to limit fecal contamination of decubitous ulcer
   - IVF to keep MAP > 60
   - monitor fluid status, HD yesterday, bloused 750 cc o/n for
   hypotension
   -recultured yesterday, f/u results.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   :  Likely secondary to sepsis.  Reportedly responding to family.
   Continue to monitor.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
    Hypoxia:  Resolving.  Most likely due to PNA.  Currently saturating
   well on vent support.  Poor EF likely also contributing.  Continue to
   wean as tolerated. Attempt PS
   -          Continue meropenem
   -          Wean as tolerated
   # Hematology: On presentation WBC to 40s, now down to 6.7. [**11-1**] diff
   with abnormal cells. Thrombocytopenic on admission but has decreased
   from 99 to 56. No heparin given this admission given h/o heparin
   allergy.  Anemia stable at 28 close to same level on admission. Chronic
   multiple line suppression concerning for marrow process. [**Month (only) 11**] also by
   [**12-23**] drugs (meropenem and vanco) or infection. [**Month (only) 11**] also be [**12-23**] ESRD
   -Hematology consult appreciated. No specific recs, likely
   multifactoiral as stated above. To follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 547**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2803**] as outpt.
   -treand CBC
   -transfuse plts for plt < 20 or active bleeding
   # Atrial flutter: New onset yesterday but likely in afib in past given
   recent h/o embolic stroke. Rate controlled. Likely triggered by change
   in fluid status / hypotension vs fever and new infectious process
   -monitor rate
   - O/N back in sinus rythem. No anitcoag given h/o stroke.;
   .
 CANDIDIASIS, ORAL
   :  Nystatin swish and suction
   .
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   :  Currently does not appear to be volume overloaded.  On HD took off
   3L on [**10-31**]
   -    on B-blocker, should begin holding dose in am on HD days to
   facilitate increased dialysis.
   -          ASA
   -          d/ced .Hydralizine/Imdur  [**12-23**] hypotension to maximize HD
   -          Consider adding back ACE later  as it becomes more clear
   that RF is not recovering, damage likely permenant
   -          Consider restarting statin prior to d/c.
   .
 .H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   : Normal CK at OSH and elevated tropinin in the setting of renal
   failure.  EKG changes are most likely due to LVH with strain pattern.
   CK flat. Troponin increase likely [**12-23**] renal failure, although some
   demand ischemia cannot be r/o.
   -          optimize CHF medications

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Continued fever.   Patient has known pneumonia with MRSA and Klebsiella
   in the past. Known to have VRE in past.  [**10-27**] Sputum culture shows
   Klebsiella with 2 separate lines isolate which was originally both
   sensitive to amikacin and meropenem.  Called today that one line is
   likely resistant to meropenem and amikacin. Coag positive staph also
   added to [**10-27**] sputum.  Fevers had largely subsided and WBC have
   decreased.  Dips in blood pressure likely secondary to positioning of
   A-line and/or post-HD hypotension (fluid responsive) so unlikely to be
   due to sepsis. New fever overnight. Diff on CBC today with multiple
   abnormal WBCs

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent pneumonia. The patient presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 148/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and thrombocytopenia. Blood cultures have revealed growth of meropenem-resistant Klebsiella and MRSA. The patient has been restarted on vancomycin and meropenem is being dosed renally. The patient's urine output has been poor with only 300 mL in 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he remains on ventilator support. He is also experiencing atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled. The patient's chronic conditions include chronic anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. He is currently being optimized"

   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with A&P as above
   by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2802**]. Temp trending down, and he is back in NSR, although now
   some episodes of brady likely due to Sick Sinus. No hypotension and
   will continue beta blockade for now. ID has evaluated Klebsiella
 for
   now holding on Colistin but organism sensitivity is very ominous.  BP
   more stable on HD recently.
