   40yo G3P2 @ 20 wks gestation presenting with vaginal bleeding from
   placenta previa, transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting
   of significant blood loss requiring emergent hysterectomy.
   # Hypotension and Anemia:
   Most likely from severe hypovolemia in the setting of profuse vaginal
   bleeding and intraoperative blood loss.  Although her Hct was 34 on
   admission, her baseline is not known and is likely higher than that.
   Upon arrival in the ICU, her Hct is 23.  Would also consider the
   possibility of sepsis or infection, although time course does not seem
   suggestive and she has remained afebrile.  Her leukocytosis is most
   likely secondary to her bleed and multiple procedures.
   - Aggressive volume resuscitation with IV fluids and RBCs
   - goal CVP > 12, MAP > 60, Urine output > 30cc/hr
   - has 2 18 gauge PIVs; will place CVL
   - arterial line for BP monitoring
   - frequent Hct and INR checks
   - monitor coags and platelets with transfusions as she is likely to
   need FFP and platelets
   - wean dopamine gtt; transition to levophed if unable to wean off of
   dopamine
   - follow serial lactates
   # S/p D&E and TAH: done emergently given placenta previa c/b uterine
   atony and heavy bleeding.  Interesting to note that she had received
   heparin to prevent DVT prior to her flight, although unclear to what
   extent this may have contributed.
   - post-surgical wound care
   - pain control w fentanyl gtt
   - transition to PO pain regimen once stabilized
   - appreciate ob/gyn recs
   - Rhogam not indicated as pt is Rh positive
   # Mechanical ventilation:
   Patient remains intubated post procedure in the setting of her
   hemodynamic instability and need for aggressive volume resuscitation.
   - change to pressure support at 5/5 and monitor given no underlying
   parenchymal pathology
   - monitor serial ABGs
   - change sedation to versed and fentanyl for now
   - once she is volume resuscitated, would favor attempt to extubate
   today if respiratory status tolerates
   # Non-gap metabolic acidosis:
   Likely from normal saline volume resuscitation.
   - will use lactated ringers for now
   # FEN:  NPO pending likely extubation; aggressive lyte repletion
   (especially Mg and Ca) while receiving blood
   # Access:  18g PIV x 2, RIJ TLC, left arterial line
   # PPx:  subQ heparin; famotidine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa. She underwent an emergent hysterectomy in the setting of significant blood loss. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and required aggressive volume resuscitation with IV fluids and blood transfusions. Her initial hemoglobin (Hct) was 34, which decreased to 26. The patient also had leukocytosis, likely secondary to the bleed and multiple procedures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension and Anemia:
   - Aggressive volume resuscitation with IV fluids and RBCs
   - goal CVP > 12, MAP > 60, Urine output > 30cc/hr
   - arterial line for BP monitoring
   - frequent Hct and INR checks
   - monitor coags and platelets with transfusions as she is likely to need FFP and platelets
   - wean dopamine gtt; transition to levophed if unable to wean off of dopamine
   - follow serial lactates

2. Post-surgical wound care:
   - pain control with fentanyl gtt
   - transition to PO pain regimen once stabilized

3. Mechanical ventilation:
   - change to pressure support at 5/5 and monitor given no underlying parenchymal pathology
   - monitor serial ABGs
   - change sedation to versed and fentanyl for"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female who presented with vaginal bleeding from placenta previa at 20 weeks gestation. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of significant blood loss and required an emergent hysterectomy.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension and anemia, likely due to hypovolemia/bleeding and cardiogenic shock with an ejection fraction of 30%. Her hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing from 34 to 26. She is no longer on dopamine infusion and her heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits.

The plan of care includes fluid bolus as needed to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 12, mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60, and urine output greater than 30 cc/hr. Monitoring hemoglobin every 8 hours is recommended, and consideration should be given to vasopressin or phenylephrine infusion if hypotension worsens. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (CTX, cipro, flagyl) have been initiated until cultures are negative for at least 48 hours, and follow-up cultures are planned.

There is also a concern for Sheehan syndrome, which is characterized by hypopituitarism following severe blood loss and hypovolemic shock during or after childbirth. Further evaluation includes checking cortisol levels this morning and ordering an MRI to assess the pituitary gland."

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs and multiple interventions performed. The patient has a history of shock, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, pain control, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and tubes inserted. His laboratory results show abnormalities in several parameters, including leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock and elevated troponin levels indicate potential myocardial damage, which could contribute to ongoing hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances raise concerns about AKI.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging suggest the possibility of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT in critically ill patients.
6. Stress ulcer: The"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female who underwent an emergency hysterectomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient was in cardiogenic shock and required intubation but has now been extubated. She has a history of cardiomyopathy and is experiencing polyuria. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight for a total of 7 units. She has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 68-88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/61 mmHg to 109/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 0-23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 9,188 mL and output of 8,670 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 518 mL. She is receiving intravenous fluids and has received blood products.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 92 K/uL, platelet count of 158 K/uL, sodium level of 137 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, blood glucose level of 143 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. The troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for shock, further evaluation of cardiomyopathy, investigation of polyuria, management of post-operative pain, and close monitoring of ICU care such as nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, infection due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines, bleeding from recent surgery or blood transfusion, and organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury or cardiac dysfunction."
