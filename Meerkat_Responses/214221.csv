","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Upon admission, the patient was found to be acidic with an ABG (arterial blood gas) reading of 7.08/115/110. Ventilator settings were adjusted to increase the respiratory rate, and acidemia resolved. The patient required a large amount of sedation on AC (assisted control), so the ventilator mode was changed to pressure control. Throughout the night, the patient's ABG continued to look good, but by 4 AM, CO2 levels slowly crept up to 50.

The patient has an arterial line inserted on 02/21/2142 at 06:48 PM and blood cultures were obtained from the arterial line and venipuncture. A sputum culture was also induced on 02/22/2142 at 03:39 AM. The patient's medical history is obtained from medical records as she is unable to provide a history due to sedation. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient received infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (versed) and other ICU medications, including changes in medication doses at different times. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's temperature, heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name **]):
   Etiology likely S. Pneumo PNA in pt with underlying asthma and smoking
   hx. Respiratory acidosis has resolved over night with altered vent
   settings.
   -          mech vent changed to PS.   Will monitor closely with serial
   ABG.  As pt tolerates, goal should be to decrease FiO2 to 40%, then if
   tolerated, to decrease PEEP.  If pH begins to decrease or pCO2 begins
   to rise may need to switch back to AC with higher RR, and may need
   greater sedation to achieve this.
   -          Change sedation to methadone gtt
   -          Continue vanc, ctx (at increased dose), azithro for S.
   Pneumo double coverage and to cover atypicals
   -          Monitor CXR daily
   -          Goal fluid status is even

","The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient presented with an ABG of 7.08/115/110 and required increased respiratory rate (RR) settings, which resolved the acidemia. Ventilator settings were changed to pressure control due to the patient requiring large amounts of sedation on assist-control (AC) mode. The patient's arterial line was started at 06:48 PM on 02/21/21, and blood cultures were drawn at 07:15 PM. Sputum culture was induced at 03:39 AM on 02/22/21.

   Patient significantly improved in past 12 hours. Now on CPAP=10.
   Patient is generating tidal volumes of 700 on these settings. With PEEP
   at 10, O2 sats are still 99%. Will need to watch this over the next 30
   minutes. If O2 sats hold in this range, would decrease PEEP to 8. Would
   then try to reduce FIO2 to 0.4 and see if saturations hold. CXR
   suggests we have recruited lung quite effectively; question is whether
   she will de-recruit with lowering of PEEP. Begin weaning propofol. Will
   continue to require narcotics to prevent withdrawal given prior
   methadone use.
   Maintain antibiotics for pneumococcal pneumonia.
   Patient continues to have significant bronchospasm on exam. Will
   maintain high dose steroids as well as inhaled bronchodilators.
   Hct down to 30 consistent with her pregnancy. No evidence of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name **])
   See graph above: P/F ratio has been rising very nicely above 300,
   suggesting resolution of ARDS. RSBI this morning was 16. Pt becoming
   agitated when off propofol; during morning rounds we decided to prepare
   for extubation (had already stopped tube feeds at 7 am in preparation
   for this). As pt
s sedation was turned down slightly she continued to
   become agitated and was moving the ETT out by biting and coughing; she
   was extubated after OG tube was suctioned, finding only gastric fluid
   with no tube feed contents. At last check was tolerating extubation
   well, would expect her to be able to stay off of vent for future, based
   on rapid recovery from ARDS.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Gram stain c/w strep pneumo at [**Hospital 120**] Hospital (where pt originally
   presented and then left AMA with a Z-pack); strep pneumo growing out in
   cultures at [**Hospital3 **] (where pt was first diagnosed with ARDS
   and from where she was transferred to us). Attempted to contact
   [**Name (NI) 120**] to get sensitivities, but pt was not found in their computer
   system this am; will need to continue to follow [**Hospital1 **] cultures for
   sensitivities. Continues on azithromycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone;
   follow-up cultures; consider d/c vanco today based on likely community
   source, no prior reason to think she should have resistant strep.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Pregnancy, [**Doctor Last Name 124**]/Ob closely following. This AM OB resident recommended
   betamethasone for fetal lung maturation, and anesthesia assessment for
   surgical suitability, followed by fetal monitoring if C-section becomes
   viable.
   NARCOTIC DEPENDENCE
   Currently weaning off versed and propofol; yesterday made transition
   from fentanyl to methadone IV. Ultimately will want to make transition
   to home dose of maintenance methadone; would spend today focusing on
   weaning sedative agents and tomorrow to switching to PO methadone and
   then to lowering dose of methadone after that.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds while intubated; advance diet after extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a pregnant female with a chief complaint of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She was previously diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia at two different hospitals. She has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support in the ICU. The patient's condition has improved, with a rising PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicating resolution of ARDS. The healthcare team plans to extubate the patient as she is tolerating it well. The patient is also on various medications, including antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and glycopyrrolate for fetal lung maturation. She is being weaned off sedative agents and transitioning to oral methadone for narcotic dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Extubation failure: The patient may experience difficulty breathing and re-intubation may be required.
2. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Bleeding: Long-term use of anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding, especially during invasive procedures.
4. Hypotension: Due to the use of vasodilators and increased fluid volume, the patient may experience low blood pressure.
5. Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance is common during pregnancy and can lead to high blood sugar levels.
6. Delirium: Weaning off sedative agents may result in del"

   NARCOTIC ADDICTION
   Oxygenation improved. Patient with good RSBI this AM. Tube feeds
   stopped. Patient still has large dead space ventilation with PaCO2=57
   and VE=9L/min. The hypercapnia will facilitate getting her off the
   ventilator since it will reduce the total amount of breathing she needs
   to do for any given level of CO2 production. She also has a mild
   primary metabolic alkalosis, likely from her diuresis. I would diurese
   further now in anticipation of extubation.
   The CXR is slightly better. Patient remains febrile although WBC seems
   to be nearing normal range. Cultures non-revealing. Continue present
   antibiotics.
   Narcotic addition may be an issue as we try to reduce sedation and move
   to extubation. Patient now on IV methadone.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia. They have been receiving IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin) for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 124/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP with FiO2 of 0.4. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.9 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and mildly decreased bicarbonate level of 28.4%.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 310. These findings suggest respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and adequate oxygenation.

The patient's chest X-ray shows some improvement in right-sided infiltrates but also indicates that the endotracheal tube is positioned too high.

The plan moving forward includes continuing the current antibiotics, monitoring"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old pregnant female admitted to the ICU with ARDS and bilateral pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. She was extubated yesterday but continues to have altered mental status and agitation. Fetal monitoring had to be discontinued due to agitation, and she was started on Haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation. 

She received a second dose of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows metabolic alkalosis without respiratory compensation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.6 C (101.4 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/83 mmHg to 174/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her physical examination reveals crackles at bilateral lung bases and a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.5 K/uL, elevated troponin level of 226 K/uL, and slightly low platelet count of 204. 

Her other lab values are within normal limits, except for elevated lactate levels and significantly elevated LDH levels. She has been diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's pregnancy is being closely monitored, and she is receiving prophylactic treatment for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old pregnant woman at 29 weeks gestation, who was admitted to the ICU with presumed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent extubation yesterday but remains mentally depressed and experienced a seizure this morning. She has been agitated overnight and is suspected to have ICU delirium, for which haloperidol was recommended. Her past medical history includes pre-eclampsia, and her current symptoms include fever, altered mental status, and seizure. She has been receiving antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and is being treated for ARDS. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, fluctuating blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies reveal reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome (REPS). The patient's condition is consistent with eclampsia/pre-eclampsia, and an urgent cesarean section has been planned. She has been started on magnesium drip and labetalol drip. The patient is critically ill and is being prepared for transportation to the operating room.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient experienced a seizure, and there is a risk of further seizures due to her underlying condition of eclampsia/pre-eclampsia.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient developed hypertension requiring labetalol. There is a risk of further hypert"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female admitted to the ICU for eclampsia. She underwent an urgent C-section and remains intubated overnight on propofol with well-controlled blood pressure. The patient has a history of seizures, elevated liver function tests, proteinuria, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on MRI. She is currently on a magnesium drip, which will be continued for 24 hours. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is showing improvement in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Eclampsia: The patient's seizures and high protein levels, along with rising blood pressure and PRES on MRI, indicate eclampsia. The patient underwent a C-section for eclampsia, and post-operatively, her blood pressure is improving. The plan is to continue the magnesium drip for 24 hours.
2. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures consistent with eclampsia. An EEG will be obtained while decreasing propofol on vent. If there is no seizure activity or if the patient is responsive neurologically, extubation may be considered. Continuous EEG will be continued for at least 24-48 hours.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the patient is responsive neurologically when propofol is discontinued, extubation may be considered.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pregnant female who was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia and subsequent eclampsia. She underwent a successful cesarean section to deliver her baby, who is currently being cared for in the nursery. The patient is currently intubated and on a magnesium drip to manage her eclampsia. She is also being treated for community-acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she should be able to tolerate extubation reasonably well. She will be transitioned to oral methadone for opiate dependence management when extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued subclinical seizures due to eclampsia.
2. Respiratory distress or failure if extubation does not go as planned.
3. Infection from the arterial line or multi-lumen line.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
5. Stress ulcer due to the stress of being in the ICU.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a pregnant woman who has been admitted to the ICU. The note describes several events that occurred over the course of two days. 

Firstly, the patient experienced a seizure in the morning, for which she was given Ativan (lorazepam) intravenously. The seizure resolved after the medication was administered. 

Secondly, the patient's liver function tests (LFTs), uric acid levels, and urine protein levels were continuously monitored due to a high likelihood of eclampsia. Throughout the day, these levels continued to rise, indicating worsening eclampsia. 

Thirdly, the patient's blood pressure also increased throughout the day, which further supports the diagnosis of eclampsia. 

Fourthly, a CT scan of the head was performed, showing no evidence of any pathology. 

Fifthly, an MRI of the brain with MRA and MRV was obtained, revealing findings consistent with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). 

Given these findings, a decision was made to perform an emergency cesarean section (C-section) to treat the eclampsia. The surgery was uneventful, and the newborn received an APGAR score of 8 and was transferred to another hospital for further care. 

After the surgery, the patient returned to the floor intubated and on magnesium sulfate, which is used for the management of eclampsia. Her magnesium level was within the"

The patient was intubated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and received antibiotics for pneumonia. She has since been extubated and is showing improvement in her respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient has been treated with appropriate antibiotics for CAP. However, discontinuing antibiotics should be done carefully to prevent any potential relapse or antibiotic resistance. Monitoring for signs of infection and close follow-up are necessary.

2. Eclampsia: The patient experienced seizures due to eclampsia, which required an emergency cesarean section. Post-delivery, she received magnesium sulfate (Mg gtt) and has shown no further evidence of seizure activity. It is important to monitor blood pressure control for systemic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 with the use of antihypertensive medications such as hydralazine or labetalol. Proteinuria and edema should improve post-delivery.

3. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which may have contributed to her poor respiratory status. Tapering off prednisone should be done cautiously to avoid withdrawal symptoms or exacerbation of asthma symptoms.

4. [Name (NI) 367]: The etiology of this condition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation who was admitted for respiratory failure and pneumonia. She subsequently developed eclampsia and underwent a cesarean section. The patient has been extubated and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/80 to 164/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for her pneumonia, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. She also requires antihypertensive medication to manage her blood pressure due to eclampsia.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine. Liver enzymes are significantly elevated. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG shows a slightly alkalotic pH with adequate oxygenation.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, moist mucous membranes, symmetric chest expansion, and good air movement bilaterally. The patient is mildly tender over the site of her C-section.

The patient's neurological status is described as sleepy"

","Summary:
The patient is a female with a chief complaint of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). She has a history of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and is currently on antibiotics. She has been extubated successfully and her magnesium levels have been discontinued. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are rising, which could be a manifestation of HELLP syndrome, but her platelet levels remain within the normal range. She will undergo an ultrasound to check for any abnormalities. The patient also has a problem of pregnancy and is being closely followed by an obstetrician. She is on methadone maintenance and requires ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Due to ARDS, the patient may experience difficulty in breathing and maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of CAP, which increases the risk of developing secondary infections and complications such as sepsis.
3. HELLP syndrome: Rising LFTs and the presence of pregnancy suggest the possibility of HELLP syndrome, which is a severe form of preeclampsia characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count.
4. Eclampsia: Given the patient's pregnancy and the presence of high blood pressure, there is a risk of developing eclampsia, a serious complication characterized by seizures.
5. Blood clots: The patient may be at risk for deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old woman admitted to the ICU at 28 weeks pregnant with respiratory failure and pneumonia. She developed eclampsia and had an emergency C-section, after which she was extubated. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia that has improved since receiving ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as well as no further evidence of seizure activity post-emergent C-section. The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is now tolerating a regular diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia relapse: Despite the improvement with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, there is still a possibility of recurrent pneumonia due to the underlying respiratory condition.
2. Eclampsia recurrence: Although the patient had no further seizure activity, there is still a risk of eclampsia recurrence, especially considering her recent delivery.
3. HELLP syndrome: Although the patient does not have low platelets, it is unclear if there is an overlap syndrome with eclampsia and HELLP. This could potentially lead to complications such as liver dysfunction or kidney injury.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but there is still a risk of hypertension due to her recent eclampsia and C-section.
5. Opiate withdrawal: The patient has a history of oxycodone abuse and is on methadone maintenance. Tapering off meth"

The patient discontinued antibiotics and started a steroid taper. There was no evidence of hemolysis on labs, and a RUQ ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder, with no other remarkable findings. The patient's neurologic assessment did not indicate a need for anti-epileptic drugs. The patient's ALT levels are still increasing, but other liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked, and they are awaiting hepatitis serologies. The patient's blood pressure has improved, and they have tolerated a regular diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted with respiratory failure and pneumonia. She developed eclampsia and underwent an emergency C-section. The patient has been extubated and is now in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She is no longer febrile and her respiratory status is improving after receiving ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
- She maintains adequate oxygen saturation on room air.
- She has no further evidence of seizure activity and does not require long-term anti-epileptic drugs according to the neuro assessment.
- The proteinuria and edema should improve post-delivery, and blood pressure control for systolic blood pressure greater than 140 will be managed with hydralazine or labetalol.
- It is appreciated that OB and neuro recommendations have been provided.
- There is a possibility of asthma contributing to poor respiratory status, but it is uncertain if this played a significant role. Prednisone taper is recommended.
- The etiology of the patient's condition remains unclear, but it is considered possible overlap syndrome with eclampsia and HELLP syndrome despite the absence of low platelets. The RUQ ultrasound showed unremarkable results aside from some biliary sludging.
- The hemolysis workup showed normal total bilirubin, elevated haptoglobin (consistent with acute illness), and elevated LDH but not specific. The patient also has a history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old pregnant woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia. She developed eclampsia and underwent an emergency C-section. The patient has been extubated and is currently on a regular diet. Her blood pressure has improved, and she is tolerating oral intake without difficulty. The patient denies any abdominal pain or shortness of breath. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for occasional cough productive of yellow sputum.

24-hour events include discontinuing antibiotics and starting a steroid taper. No evidence of hemolysis is observed on labs. An RUQ ultrasound reveals sludge in the gallbladder, but otherwise, it is unremarkable. Per neuro, there is no indication for anti-epileptic drugs. ALT levels are still increasing, but other liver function tests have peaked. Hepatitis serologies are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/86 to 167/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's weight is 79.7 kg, and her height is 65 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 760 mL, with 580 mL taken orally, 180 mL via IV fluids, and a total output of 1,795 mL, including 620 mL of urine. Blood products totaling 620 mL have been transfused. The patient is no longer on mechanical ventilation, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, no tenderness, rigidity, or guarding. Crackles are heard on the right side of the chest, and no wheezes are noted. Neurologic examination shows an attentive patient with brisk and symmetric deep tendon reflexes.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). Other lab values are within normal limits. An RUQ ultrasound reveals sludge in the gallbladder, but no other abnormalities are observed. Doppler evaluation of the liver shows normal hepatopetal flow and waveforms, with patent hepatic veins and arteries.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient is no longer febrile, and her respiratory status is improving after receiving ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She should maintain adequate oxygen saturation while monitoring for any worsening symptoms.
2. Eclampsia: The patient has had seizures, which were managed with magnesium sulfate. No further seizure activity has been observed, and there is no indication for long-term anti-epileptic drugs, as per neuro assessment. An EEG can be discontinued, and the patient should not drive for six"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has experienced several medical complications, including seizure due to eclampsia, hepatitis (presumably HELLP syndrome), and bacterial pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate (85 bpm), blood pressure (132/70 mmHg), respiratory rate (17 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (91%). The patient's weight has decreased from 86 kg at admission to 79.7 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (22.2 K/uL), hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 26.2% to 28.2%, and platelet count (Plt) ranging from 207 to 243. Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), suggesting liver injury. Other lab results, such as creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and electrolyte levels, are within normal ranges.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound was performed to check for fatty liver. The arterial line was stopped at 05:00 PM on 02/26/2142. The patient is being treated with hydralazine and other ICU medications.

The patient's neurological examination reveals that she is"
