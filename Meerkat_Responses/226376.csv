","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a 5-day history of headache and was found to have a significantly elevated blood pressure ranging from 200-210. He was admitted to the MICU and initially treated with a nitroprusside drip. His current condition shows improvement with controlled blood pressure on labetalol, and he is off the nitroprusside since 10 pm. The patient continues to experience a headache without any vision changes or chest pain. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure within the target range of 140-160, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient initially presented with a very high blood pressure reading of 200-210, indicating a hypertensive emergency. However, his blood pressure is now controlled on labetalol, so this complication seems to have been managed effectively.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.5 at the primary care physician's office to 1.8. This rapid increase in creatinine suggests AKI. It could be due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) or other factors. Renal MRI was recommended by the outpatient nephrologist, and inpatient nephrology consultation may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a 5-day history of headache and was found to have severely elevated blood pressure (SBP in 200-210). He was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. The urine metanephrines were negative, ruling out pheochromocytoma. There were no chest pain, visual changes, or dyspnea. The opththalmologic exam was unremarkable. Nitroprusside was continued, and oral labetolol was started at a higher dose than his outpatient regimen. Lisinopril was held due to acute kidney injury (Cr. 1.8), which might be related to the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Renal MRI was recommended by the outpatient nephrologist. The patient's renal labs are being trended, and lisinopril has been held. Medications are being renally dosed, and urine electrolytes are being monitored. Further workup is being done in collaboration with outpatient providers. If the creatinine level continues to rise, inpatient nephrology consultation will be sought.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency or encephalopathy: The patient's initial presentation of severely elevated blood pressure and subsequent headache suggests the possibility of hypertensive emergency or encephalopathy. Prompt management with antihypertensive agents and close"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a 5-day history of headache and was found to have a blood pressure of 200-210, leading to admission to the MICU. The patient has been on a nitroprusside drip but has shown improvement in blood pressure after starting oral labetolol at a higher dose than his outpatient regimen. The patient's urine metanephrines were negative, ruling out pheochromocytoma.

The patient has developed acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.8, which was 1.5 at the outpatient office on Monday. This increase in creatinine might be due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor. Renal MRI was recommended by the outpatient nephrologist. The patient's electrolyte levels and other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/94 to 191/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on sinus bradycardia.

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is a headache, which is improving. They have a history of hypertension and were admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient received nitroprusside infusion, but it was discontinued after starting labetalol. There was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure from the 200s to the 140s. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/94 mmHg to 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with ABG results of ///28/. The physical examination shows sinus bradycardia, and the patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurological assessment is also not completed. Laboratory results show normal levels of creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient has been placed on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is discussed, and their disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of blood pressure control, development of DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient's"

   presented with 5 days of headache, found to have SBP in 200-210,
   admitted to MICU on nitroprusside drip.
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 13801**] initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2151-3-8**] with a new, dull,
   constant headache, was found to have BP 200/120, Cr. 1.5, aldosterone
   61, renin 1.9. Serum metaneprhine fraction was normal; 24-hr urine
   metanephrine pending. He was started on lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three
   days later, BP was still high, and his lisinopril was increased to 40
   mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] was added. Outpatient nephrologist
   suggested renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He
   went back to the PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was
   found to be unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache,
   he presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
   shortness of breath, weakness.
   .
   In ED, initial BP was 200-210/110-120, HR in the 50s. Exam, including
   optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was started on
   nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped quickly to 160.
   Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min. By transfer to MICU,
   his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one Percocet for his headache.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension presenting with a 5-day history of headache and high blood pressure ranging from 200-210/110-120 mmHg. He was initially treated with nitroprusside, which effectively controlled his blood pressure. The patient's medication regimen includes heparin, labetalol, and Tylenol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pheochromocytoma: The patient's presentation raises concern for pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor that causes excessive production of catecholamines leading to episodic hypertension. However, urine metanephrines were reportedly negative, which makes this diagnosis less likely.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.9, indicating possible AKI. The recent increase in creatinine might be due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril). Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could include renal artery stenosis (RAS) or primary hypertension.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of 350 mL over 24 hours, indicating potential dehydration. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary.
4. Hypertensive Encephalopathy: The patient's persistent headache and high blood pressure may suggest hypertensive encephalopathy, although the physical examination did not reveal any significant"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 13801**] initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2151-3-8**] with a new, dull,
   constant headache, was found to have BP 200/120, Cr. 1.5, aldosterone
   61, renin 1.9. Serum metaneprhine fraction was normal; 24-hr urine
   metanephrine pending. He was started on lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three
   days later, BP was still high, and his lisinopril was increased to 40
   mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] was added. Outpatient nephrologist
   suggested renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He
   went back to the PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was
   found to be unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache,
   he presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
   shortness of breath, weakness.
   .
   In ED, initial BP was 200-210/110-120, HR in the 50s. Exam, including
   optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was started on
   nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped quickly to 160.
   Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min. By transfer to MICU,
   his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one Percocet for his headache.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension presenting with a persistent headache. His blood pressure has been high, ranging from 200-210/110-120 mmHg. He was started on nitroprusside drip, which quickly controlled his blood pressure. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.8, and there are concerns about acute kidney injury possibly due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor. The patient's urine metanephrines were negative, ruling out pheochromocytoma. The plan includes continuing high-dose oral labetalol, monitoring for headache and pain control, holding lisinopril, and performing renal ultrasound with doppler to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. The patient's other medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension leading to target organ damage.
2. Acute kidney injury due to ACE inhibitor use or underlying renal pathology.
3. Renal artery stenosis causing secondary hypertension.
4. Pheochromocytoma, although urine metanephrines were negative.
5. Fluid overload or imbalances based on fluid balance sheet.
6. Possible medication side effects or interactions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension who presented with a 5-day history of headache and significantly elevated blood pressure ranging from 200-210/110-120 mmHg. He was initially treated with lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, but his blood pressure remained high. Labetolol was then added, but his blood pressure still did not improve significantly. He was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip, which quickly lowered his blood pressure to 160/100 mmHg. He also received one Percocet for his headache.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure ranging from 148/94 to 191/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, which has increased from 1.5 mg/dL at the PCP's office. Other lab values include glucose at 92 mg/dL, calcium at 9.1 mg/dL, magnesium at 2.5 mg/dL, and phosphate at 4.9 mg/dL.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-201 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and receiving medications for hypertension and renal failure. The patient's renal function is impaired as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and blood products. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly elevated, which may indicate a hypertensive emergency. If not managed promptly, this could result in end-organ damage, including cardiac complications, stroke, or other systemic effects.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and the use of prophylactic heparin. If a DVT develops, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening condition.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a headache and was found to have a systolic blood pressure of 200-210. The patient was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/97 mmHg to 201/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The cause of the hypertension is likely essential hypertension, and the renal ultrasound did not show any renal artery stenosis. The patient's headache seems to respond to blood pressure control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite treatment, indicating a potential risk of further complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute kidney injury, which may be due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor or other factors. Proper monitoring and management of renal function are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Renal artery stenosis: Although the renal ultrasound did not show any evidence of renal artery stenosis, it is still important to consider this possibility given the patient's presentation and follow-up imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a headache and was found to have significantly elevated blood pressure levels ranging from 200-210 mmHg. The patient was admitted to the MICU and placed on a nitroprusside drip to control his blood pressure. Currently, he is being managed with labetalol and his blood pressure is within the target range of 140-160 mmHg.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated since admission, with an increase in creatinine levels from 1.5 to 1.8 mg/dL. This may be attributed to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been diagnosed, and the patient's renal function is being closely monitored. Renal labs are being trended, and medications are being dosed accordingly. Further evaluation by an inpatient nephrologist will be sought if the patient's creatinine continues to rise.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/97 to 201/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with no new neurologic findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension leading to end-organ damage.
2. Acute kidney injury progressing to chronic kidney disease.
3. Infection due to immunosuppression or indwelling lines/catheters.
4. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Stroke or transient ischemic attack.
6. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
7. Liver dysfunction or failure.
8. Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 13801**] initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2151-3-8**] with a new, dull,
   constant headache, was found to have BP 200/120, Cr. 1.5, aldosterone
   61, renin 1.9. Serum metaneprhine fraction was normal; 24-hr urine
   metanephrine pending. He was started on lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three
   days later, BP was still high, and his lisinopril was increased to 40
   mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] was added. Outpatient nephrologist
   suggested renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He
   went back to the PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was
   found to be unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache,
   he presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
   shortness of breath, weakness.
   .
   In ED, initial BP was 200-210/110-120, HR in the 50s. Exam, including
   optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was started on
   nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped quickly to 160.
   Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min. By transfer to MICU,
   his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one Percocet for his headache.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension presenting with a persistent headache and extremely high blood pressure. He was initially prescribed lisinopril and later increased the dosage, but his blood pressure remained high. An outpatient nephrologist suggested an MRI for further evaluation of his elevated creatinine levels. He presented to the emergency department with unchanged blood pressure and was started on nitroprusside. His blood pressure was successfully lowered to 160, and he was transferred to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's extremely high blood pressure puts him at risk for a hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction or damage, which may be exacerbated by his uncontrolled hypertension.
3. Cerebral Hemorrhage: The patient's persistent headache raises concern for possible cerebral hemorrhage, especially considering his high blood pressure.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: Prolonged uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
5. Endocrine Abnormalities: The patient's elevated aldosterone levels suggest possible endocrine abnormalities, which may contribute to his hypertension and overall health risks.

Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and stabilize the patient's condition."

   admitted to MICU on nitroprusside drip.
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 13801**] initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2151-3-8**] with a new, dull,
   constant headache, was found to have BP 200/120, Cr. 1.5, aldosterone
   61, renin 1.9. Serum metaneprhine fraction was normal; 24-hr urine
   metanephrine pending. He was started on lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three
   days later, BP was still high, and his lisinopril was increased to 40
   mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] was added. Outpatient nephrologist
   suggested renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He
   went back to the PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was
   found to be unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache,
   he presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
   shortness of breath, weakness.
   .
   In ED, initial BP was 200-210/110-120, HR in the 50s. Exam, including
   optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was started on
   nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped quickly to 160.
   Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min. By transfer to MICU,
   his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one Percocet for his headache.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension who presented with a five-day history of headache and significantly elevated blood pressure ranging from 200-210/110-120 mmHg. The patient was initially started on lisinopril 20 mg qday but still had high blood pressure, so the dose was increased to 40 mg qday and labetalol 100 mg was added. Despite these treatments, the patient's blood pressure remained unchanged, and he was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. In the ICU, his blood pressure quickly decreased to 160 mmHg after starting nitroprusside, and he received one dose of Percocet for his headache. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 70s and blood pressure ranging from 155/97 to 201/130 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and he has a SpO2 of 98% on room air. His physical examination is unremarkable except for elevated blood pressure. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine level (Cr) from 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose level (Glucose). Other labs, including kidney function tests and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

The patient initially presented to his primary care physician (PCP) with a new, dull, constant headache. He was found to have a high blood pressure reading of 200/120 mmHg, elevated creatinine level of 1.5, and abnormal aldosterone and renin levels. Serum metaneprhine fraction was normal, and 24-hour urine metanephrine was pending. He was started on lisinopril 20 mg daily. Three days later, his blood pressure was still high, and the dose of lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily. An outpatient nephrologist suggested a renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He went back to the PCP's office the day of admission when his blood pressure was found unchanged; labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] was added.

The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension who presented with a 5-day history of headache. He was found to have a high systolic blood pressure ranging from 200-210 mmHg and was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. The patient initially presented to his primary care physician (PCP) with new-onset, dull constant headache and was found to have high blood pressure, elevated creatinine levels, aldosterone levels of 61, and renin levels of 1.9. Serum metanephrine fraction was normal, and a 24-hour urine metanephrine test was pending. The patient was started on lisinopril 20 mg daily, but his blood pressure remained high, so the dose was increased to 40 mg daily. Labetolol was also added. Outpatient nephrologist suggested a renal MRI for further work-up of his elevated creatinine levels. The patient returned to the PCP's office the next day with unchanged blood pressure, and labetolol was added. Due to persistent headache, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED). In the ED, initial blood pressure was 200-210/110-120 mmHg, and heart rate was in the 50s. The patient's creatinine level was 1.8. He was started on nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension.
- He presented with a severe headache and was found to have a systolic blood pressure of 200-210.
- He was admitted to the MICU and initially treated with a nitroprusside drip.
- His blood pressure is now controlled with medications including labetalol, amlodipine, and recently restarted nitroglycerin.
- The patient has a history of benign hypertension, but recently developed acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.9.
- The cause of ARF is likely due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor.
- Renal US ruled out renal artery stenosis (RAS).
- The patient also has a history of fever and neutropenia, but MRSA screen was negative.
- He is being monitored closely with regular renal labs and will require a renal biopsy for further evaluation and management.
- The patient's other conditions include hypertension, which is likely essential, and acute kidney injury.
- His vital signs are stable, with blood pressure controlled and normal oxygen saturation.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,085 mL and output of 2,775 mL over the past 24 hours.
- Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a headache and was found to have a blood pressure of 200-210 mmHg. He was admitted to the MICU and started on a nitroprusside drip. His blood pressure has been controlled with medication including labetalol and amlodipine. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. His renal ultrasound was negative for renal artery stenosis. He also has benign hypertension and is being monitored closely. The plan includes restarting the nitroglycerin drip, starting HCTZ, continuing labetalol and amlodipine, holding lisinopril, following up with a renal ultrasound, monitoring headaches and pain control, and arranging for a renal consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's initial high blood pressure of 200-210 mmHg indicates a hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL suggests acute kidney injury, possibly due to the initiation of an ACE inhibitor or other factors.
3. Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS): Although the renal ultrasound was negative for RAS, there is still a possibility of this condition causing the patient's renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension who presented with a headache and high blood pressure readings of 200-210. He was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. His current vital signs include a blood pressure of 150/98 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on multiple medications including labetalol, amlodipine, and HCTZ for hypertension, and his renal function is being closely monitored due to acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9. The patient's renal ultrasound did not show any signs of renal artery stenosis (RAS). He is also being treated for an infection with IV antibiotics and is receiving nutrition and glycemic control as per ICU protocol. The patient's code status is full code, and he is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Uncontrolled Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite medication, which increases the risk of further complications such as stroke, cardiac events, or organ damage.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function. If left untreated, AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.

3. Infection: Although the patient is receiving IV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed hypertension. He presented with a blood pressure reading of 200-210 and was admitted to the MICU on a nitroprusside drip. The patient's current medications include HCTZ, amlodipine, and labetalol. His vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. There is a possibility of renal artery stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, especially considering the high renin level. The patient is currently on heparin prophylaxis and a bowel regimen. His code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the medical floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal artery stenosis: This is a condition where there is narrowing of the renal artery, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the kidneys and cause renal failure.
2. Fibromuscular dysplasia: This is a condition that affects the walls of the arteries and can lead to abnormal growths, causing narrowing of the arteries, including the renal arteries.
3. Acute renal failure: The elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function, which can progress to acute renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Hypertension: Despite the current management of hypertension, there is still a risk of uncontrolled blood pressure, which can lead to complications such as stroke or"
