","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She presented with fever and multifocal infiltrates, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/40 to 150/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 14 mmHg. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels at 0.25, and slightly low platelet count of 212. Other lab values, including kidney and liver function tests, are within normal limits. 

The patient's urine output has been low, with only 347 mL in the past 24 hours. Chest X-ray shows diffuse multifocal bilateral areas of infiltrate, consistent with pneumonia. 

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia and atypical organisms. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She presented with fever and multifocal infiltrates, leading to intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation but still requires assisted ventilation due to significant secretions. The plan is to switch to assist control mode and continue sedation minimization. Additional measures such as suctioning thick secretions, removing extra tubing from the vent setup for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and administering nebulizers will be implemented.

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is low, which may be due to sepsis, hemoconcentration, or a discrete vascular lesion in the renal artery. Goals include maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) above 9-27 mmHg, administering 500-1000 mL fluid boluses as needed, monitoring urine output, and trending lactates on arterial blood gases (ABGs).

3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's lactate levels are normal, there is suspicion of sepsis based on the presence of fever and multifocal infiltrates. Cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

4. EKG Changes: The patient has evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)"

   # Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Respiratory status has improved with better
   oxygenation, although required more sedation on PSV; will switch to
   assist control. Continues to have significant secretions.  WBC has come
   down dramatically. Tidal volumes are small off of pressure support.
   Will need to do SBT's with extra tubing removed from the vent setup as
   possibly too much dead space for her. Airway resistance also likely
   high with some wheezing on exam and thick secretions being suctioned.
   Multifocal infiltrates on CXR.  Per HCP, pt had recent PNA though
   unclear if aspiration at baseline.

   # Hypotension/low urine output: Etiology likely multifactorial.
   Possibly due to sepsis but unlikely given normal lactate and absence of
   tachycardia.  CVPs around 10.  Some hct drop since admission but
   suspect hemoconcentration on admission.  Urine output may be varying
   with blood pressure, suggestive of a discrete vascular lesion in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She presented with fever and multifocal infiltrates, leading to intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she continues to have significant secretions and requires ongoing suctioning. Her WBC count has decreased, indicating a possible improvement in infection. The patient's tidal volumes are small, suggesting the need for removal of extra tubing from the ventilator setup to reduce dead space. Multifocal infiltrates on the chest X-ray indicate pneumonia, and the patient has recently had a previous pneumonia episode. 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and oliguria/anuria, with a possible etiology of sepsis but normal lactate levels and absence of tachycardia. Her CVP is around 10, and there has been a drop in hemoglobin since admission, which could be due to hemoconcentration or renal involvement. 

The patient's troponin levels are positive, indicating an NSTEMI. Statins have been started, and repeat EKG shows normal results. 

Other issues include anemia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and femoral hernia. Prophylactic measures include heparin for DVT and famotidine for stress ulcers. 

The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She presented with fever and multifocal infiltrates and is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues including oliguria/anuria, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/low urine output, NSTEMI, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: This refers to low urine output and can be a sign of kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's infection may progress to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates inadequate oxygenation, which can be caused by lung infections, pneumonia, or other respiratory conditions.
4. Hypotension/Low Urine Output: The patient's low blood pressure and reduced urine output suggest poor perfusion and possible organ hypoxia.
5. NSTEMI: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction is a type of heart attack that may occur due to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle. It is important to monitor the patient's EKGs and cardiac enzymes.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, indicating a potential need for blood transfusion or further investigation into the cause of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient self-extubated at 2 AM but was reintubated. The patient's urine output has decreased, and they have been given fluid boluses to increase central venous pressure (CVP); however, the patient's blood pressure remains low. The patient's oxygenation is acceptable, and their chest exam sounds better than yesterday. The patient's CXR shows worsening infiltrates, which may be a natural progression of the infection. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is drifting down but not at the transfusion threshold. The patient's lactate levels are normal, arguing against sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's low urine output could indicate acute kidney injury or inadequate renal perfusion.
2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's lactate levels are normal, the presence of pneumonia and decreased urine output may suggest an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition of respiratory failure could worsen if oxygenation decreases or if there is a further deterioration in lung function.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening infiltrates on CXR suggest ongoing infection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib and HTN who presented with fever and
   multifocal infiltrates, now intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure:  CMV o/n after another self-extubation
   yesterday, switched to PS this am with presence of airway obstruction
   on exam.  Plan SBT's with extra tubing removed from the vent setup as
   possibly too much dead space for her. Secretions difficult to assess-
   seemingly very thick and difficult to suction until after chest PT.
   Worsening multifocal infiltrates on CXR which may be progression of
   infectious process or compounded by likely possible aspirations after
   self-extubations
   - cont Vanc/Azithro, added [**Last Name (un) **] to cover for possible ESBL and cipro
   for double pseudomonas coverage
   - cefepime d/c yesterday
   - f/u blood and sputum cx
   - SBTs with removal of extra tubing
   - minimize sedation although not too low as patient has self extubated
   twice
   - increase standing nebs frequency to q2 and add steroids to relieve
   airway obstruction
   - consider bronch today to re-eval airways
   - VAP bundle
   .
   # Hypotension/low urine output: Resolved. Etiology likely
   multifactorial- possibly due to sepsis but unlikely given normal
   lactate and absence of tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been hypovolemic as CVPs
   responded to fluid boluses but still has low urine output.  EKG without
   significant change.  Today her CVP is varying greatly with respiration
   which suggests she is not fluid overloaded.  Goal for today, even
   volume status or 500cc negative.
   - goal CVP>[**9-27**]
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   - trend lactates on ABGs
   .
   # R hand cyanosis: Improving since last night, suspect small R radial
   artery thrombus after multiple A-line attempts yesterday.  Radial pulse
   found by Doppler.
   -monitor R hand cap refill, perfusion

   # NSTEMI: Troponins positive yesterday and trending down.  Statins
   started.   Repeat EKG normal. Suspect demand ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
- She presented with fever and multifocal infiltrates, leading to intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- She self-extubated once and required re-intubation.
- Her current condition includes oliguria/anuria, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/low urine output, right hand cyanosis, NSTEMI, anemia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and fecal incontinence.
- She has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 122/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.
- Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels.
- Imaging shows worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient's current plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia, monitoring blood and sputum cultures, performing spontaneous breathing trials with removal of extra tubing from the ventilator, minimizing sedation, increasing the frequency of nebulizer treatments, considering a bronchoscopy to re-evaluate airways, and implementing a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was admitted with fever and multifocal infiltrates, leading to intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing oliguria/anuria, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/low urine output, right hand cyanosis, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen if there is further deterioration in oxygenation or if the ventilation support is not adequate.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient currently does not have organ dysfunction, there is a risk of progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure if the infection is not controlled effectively.
3. Hypotension/low Urine Output: The patient's low urine output may indicate renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Monitoring the central venous pressure (CVP) and maintaining adequate fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Right Hand Cyanosis: The improvement in the patient's right hand cyanosis suggests a small radial artery thrombus. Continued monitoring for perfusion and capillary refill is necessary to assess the extent of ischemia.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are trending down, but ongoing monitoring"

   .
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib and HTN with multifocal pneumonia,
   hypotension and oliguria
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Most likely from multifocal pneumonia. Pt still
   hypoxemic on PS and was changed back to AC. Also appears fluid
   overloaded and may have mild pulm edema.
   - cont Vanc/ [**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro to cover for possible ESBL and for double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - d/c Azithromycin given QT prolongation on EKG and Legionella negative
   - Lasix 10mg IV
 will follow I/O with goal negative 500cc.
   - f/u blood and sputum cx
   - minimize sedation although not too low as patient has self extubated
   twice
   - continue standing nebs
   -Continue steroids to relieve airway obstruction
   -If pt not off ventilator by [**Last Name (un) 501**] [**2145-7-26**]
   .
   # Hypotension/low urine output: Pt with UOP 40-80cc/hr. Received 2.5L
   fluid overnight. CVP fluctuating. Etiology likely multifactorial-
   Sepsis unlikely given normal lactate and absence of tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been hypovolemic as CVPs responded to fluid boluses but still has
   low urine output.  Goal for today, even volume status or 500cc
   negative.
   - Decrease sedation as UOP improves when BP is higher
   - goal CVP>[**9-27**]
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   - trend lactates on ABGs
   .
   # Goals of care: Daughter here yesterday.
   -Will request daughter to come in today for family meeting to discuss
   goals of care
   -If not off ventilator [**Last Name (LF) 501**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] do tracheostomy
   .
   # R hand cyanosis: Improving since last night, suspect small R radial
   artery thrombus after multiple A-line attempts.  Radial pulse found by
   Doppler.
   -monitor R hand cap refill, perfusion
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponins trending down.  Statins started. Suspect demand
   ischemia.
   - Will stop following troponins
   - monitor EKGs
   .
   # Anemia: Slight Hct decrease (29
 27), likely dilutional given pt
   received 2L fluid.
   - monitor hct
   .
   # Afib: NSR currently. Pt not on any rate control agents at baseline
   and not anticoagulated per records.
   - monitor HR

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was admitted with multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, and oliguria.
- The patient required invasive ventilation but had to be switched back to assist-control (AC) mode due to hypoxemia and elevated PaCO2.
- She received a total of 2.5L of normal saline for low urine output and hypotension.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 83/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Physical examination reveals scleral edema, diffuse bilateral rhonchi with wheezes, regular heart rhythm, nondistended abdomen, cool extremities with slight capillary refill delay.
- Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.7, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 108 mEq/L, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L.
- Imaging shows worsening bibasilar infiltrates since the previous day, which may represent pneumonia or fluid accumulation, along with improvement in upper lobe infiltrates.
- The patient's current assessments and plans include olig"

   AIRFLOW OBSTRUCTION
   ========================
   Patient's ABGs improved with assist control. Airflow obstruction seems
   a bit better on exam now that steroids started.  Will also try to
   diurese today; BUN/creat ratio is low - will try to achieve negative
   fluid balance for the day of 0.5L.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Try to reduce sedation a bit; patient tends to urinate better when BP a
   little higher.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues, including acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, expiratory airflow obstruction, and anemia. The patient is currently on assisted control ventilation due to rising PaCO2 on pressure support ventilation. Oxygenation remains stable at FIO2=0.4. The patient has been hemodynamically stable with a WBC count down.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to acetaminophen, unknown allergies, and a history of antibiotic use. They are currently receiving midazolam (versed) and other ICU medications.

Vital signs and flow sheet data indicate that the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is high, respiratory rate is controlled, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg, fluid balance with an intake of 2,899 mL and output of 1,200 mL, and total fluid balance of 1,699 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart rhythm, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with coarse crackles and diffuse wheezes, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in extremities, warm skin, and purposeful movement with normal tone.

Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Imaging indicates bibasilar infiltrates with no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was admitted with multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, and oliguria. The patient made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision yesterday and is currently awaiting the arrival of her other daughter.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/39mmHg to 170/71mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, and glucose of 219 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's goals of care include terminal extubation today and pain management with morphine for comfort measures only (CMO). The plan for terminal extubation involves discontinuing mechanical ventilation and allowing the patient to breathe spontaneously. The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is likely due to multifocal pneumonia, and there have been no changes made to the ventilator settings overnight"
