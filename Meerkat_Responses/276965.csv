   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F w/ COPD, morbid obesity, TBM and failure to wean vent.
   #  Failure to wean/COPD/TBM: Tolerated PEEP 5 until she was turned and
   then became dyspnic, tachypnic and had to have PEEP increased. Likely
   that when in turning position her pannus caused her some difficulty
   expanding her lungs which then led to tachypnea/airtrapping.  Pt. does
   have significant dead space ~.58, so mostly COPD.
   - Sit upright/reverse trendelenberg
   - Nebs
   - Consider stent when PEEP lower, will d/w IP
   - Fluticasone
   - Prednisone home dose consider wean post extubation
   .
   #Anxiety: Well controlled currently
   - Continue seroquel for now
   .
   #DMII: Will be worse w/ seroquel, FSBS well controlled recently
   - Continue insulin regimen
   .
   #Trach pain
   - wean dilaudid
   - Tylenol
   .
   #Thrush:Improved.
   - Nystatin PRN
   .
   #HTN: Currently fairly well controlled
   - continue dilt/enalapril, would attempt to simplify regimen when
   extubated before d/c.
   .
   #Hypernatremia:
   - Increase rate of free water flush in TFs
   .
   #Anemia: Phlebotomizing downward
   - Limit blood draws
   .
   #Nutrition: Getting TFs through NGT

   # DISPO: ICU
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient tolerated a PEEP of 5 until she was turned and then became dyspneic and tachypneic, requiring an increase in PEEP. It is likely that the patient's pannus caused difficulty expanding her lungs during the turning position, leading to tachypnea and air trapping. The patient has significant dead space of approximately 0.58, suggesting that COPD is the main cause of her failure to wean.

Plan:
1. Sit upright/reverse trendelenberg: This position can help improve lung expansion and oxygenation.
2. Nebulizer treatments (Nebs): Administering nebulized medications can help manage COPD symptoms and facilitate weaning.
3. Consider stent placement when PEEP is lower: A stent may be necessary to address any obstruction caused by the patient's pannus.
4. Consult interventional pulmonology (IP): IP specialists can assist in managing airway issues.
5. Fluticasone: This medication can help reduce airway inflammation.
6. Prednisone home dose consider wean post extubation: Steroid therapy may be required to manage COPD symptoms after extubation.
7. Anxiety management: Continue using seroquel for anxiety control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, who has been tracheostomized after experiencing respiratory failure. She was transferred to the MICU yesterday and tolerated ventilator settings with a pressure support (PS) of 14/8 and passed the respiratory system assessment by monitoring (RSBI). However, she had to be put back on pressure control ventilation (PCV) with PS 18/8 due to hypertension and tachypnea. She improved with high-dose bronchodilators and increased ventilator support.

The patient has multiple allergies to certain medications. She is currently on several medications in the ICU, including metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), haloperidol (Haldol), and others.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/63 mmHg to 202/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight remains unchanged since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,020 mL and output of 1,780 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 240 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. Her set tidal volume (Vt) is 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure is also 24 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%. She has an RSBI of 54 and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals that she is awake, alert, and follows commands. She has diminished breath sounds on the right side, regular rapid respirations (RRR), and minimal edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), while her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of COPD with bronchodilators and fluticasone, addressing anxiety with trial doses of ativan and follow-up on mental status and anxiety, and correcting hypernatremia with increased free water boluses. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, furosemide, haloperidol, and others. Her recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low albumin levels. The patient's respiratory support mode has been changed multiple times due to hypertension and tachypnea, and she has shown improvement with the use of high-dose bronchodilators and increased ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Barotrauma: The patient's COPD and the need for high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may increase the risk of barotrauma, which can lead to lung injury. Regular assessment of her chest x-rays and respiratory status is essential.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient tolerated a PEEP of 5 cmH2O well throughout the day and night, and it was decided to increase the PEEP to 8 cmH2O and wean down the PS (peak inspiratory pressure) today.

The patient is currently on several medications including lorazepam (for anxiety), famotidine (for peptic ulcer disease), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other ICU medications. The patient also has allergies to sulfa, cephalexin, levofloxacin, and risedronate sodium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 151/64 to 93/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,052 mL and output of 3,430 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,378 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 300 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, morbid obesity, TBM (tuberculosis), and failure to wean from the ventilator.
- The patient tolerated PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) at 5 cmH2O until she was turned and then experienced dyspnea, tachypnea, and had to have PEEP increased. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty expanding her lungs due to her pannus (excessive fat tissue) when in the turning position.
- The patient has significant dead space ventilation of approximately 0.58, indicating mostly COPD-related issues.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/60 mmHg to 151/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,052 mL and output of 3,430 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,378 mL.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin for prophylaxis.
- The patient's labs show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and plate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's PEEP has been weaned to 5 cmH2O and tolerated without difficulty. She is also receiving various medications including lorazepam, famotidine, heparin sodium, insulin sliding scale, prednisone, seroquel, albuterol, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/69 to 93/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her temperature is within normal range. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 1,052 mL and output of 3,430 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,378 mL. The patient's respiratory support indicates that she is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 290 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 65 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 193 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated at 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is slightly decreased at 29.7%, platelet count (Plt) is within normal range at 415 K/uL, and creatinine (Cr) is within normal range at 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level (K+) of 5.3 mEq/L. The patient's assessment includes ongoing respiratory failure due to COPD, and she requires continued inhaled bronchodilators and home dose steroids. There are plans to increase PEEP from 5 to [**7-26**] and reassess compliance and comfort, as well as trial to decrease inspiratory pressure. The patient also has neuro anxiety, for which she is receiving seroquel and ativan 0.5mg prn. The patient's nutrition is being provided through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 25 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained through insulin sliding scale. The patient has PICC and arterial lines in place for prophylaxis against DVT and stress ulcers, respectively.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with COPD who has been intubated for respiratory failure. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube, and her PEEP has been weaned to 5 cmH2O without difficulty. She is receiving various medications including lorazepam, famotidine, heparin, insulin, prednisone, Seroquel, albuterol, and others. Her vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/69 mmHg to 93/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's recent imaging shows no significant abnormalities. She is being monitored closely in the ICU, with ongoing management of her respiratory failure and potential transfer for ventilator weaning. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and glycemic control issues."

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and failure to wean off the ventilator. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube, PEEP set at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and her SpO2 is 94%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 mmHg to 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety, which is currently well controlled with lorazepam. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, both of which are being managed with medication. The patient also has tracheal pain, improved thrush, hypernatremia, anemia, and nutrition concerns. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her creatinine and glucose levels are within normal limits, but her sodium level is slightly elevated at 146 mEq/L. Other lab values such as potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of thrush, icterus, or edema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and failure to wean from the ventilator. She is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation for two weeks. She is also experiencing anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypertension (high blood pressure), and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-136/65-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 98-125 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Obstruction: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which increases the risk of airway obstruction. This can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: Due to prolonged intubation and immobility, the patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Symptoms may include fever, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygen saturation.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with COPD who was admitted to the ICU due to an exacerbation and possible tuberculosis (TBM). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 161/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is awake, alert, and follows commands. Her chest examination shows clear anterior fields, and she has a rapid shallow breathing pattern. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors should be administered.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring other nos"

   #  Failure to wean/COPD/TBM: Doing well on 16/10.  NIF -40 suggests
   resp muscle weakness.  Likely from 2 week ventilation.
   - Plan for bronch today, IP to see if she needs a stent
   - Nebs
   - Fluticasone
   - Prednisone home dose consider wean post extubation
   -NIF low at 23 yesterday, no other signs of  muscular weakness so
   likely just due to extended intubation but will monitor for other signs
   of weakness. If that occurs, consider EMG/NCS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and failure to wean from the ventilator. She is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 148/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on endotracheal ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient has several medical complications, including anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and airway obstruction. These conditions require specific management plans as outlined in the assessment and plan section of the note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD symptoms, further respiratory distress, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential complications related to long-term ventilation such as muscle weakness and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and ongoing management of her various medical conditions to ensure her safety and well-being."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Key points from the note include:
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, with decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and increased tidal volume (Vt).
- The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 96%, indicating good oxygenation.
- The patient's respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 53, which suggests the possibility of impending respiratory failure if PEEP is above 10 cmH2O.
- The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/78 mmHg, but this may be due to the use of vasopressor medication.
- The patient's heart rate, temperature, and white blood cell count are within normal limits.
- The patient's serum sodium level is elevated at 145 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.
- The patient has a history of anxiety, which is currently well-controlled with lorazepam.
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II and her blood sugars are well-controlled with insulin.
- The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, and it is planned to perform bronchoscopic evaluation today"

The patient is awake and alert, with clear lung fields and regular heart rhythm. She has a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics, keflex, levaquin, and actonel. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 98 to 125 mg/dL. Other lab values such as BUN, creatinine, and liver function tests are within normal range. 

The patient's current medications include heparin for DVT prophylaxis, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and chronic prednisone. The patient is being managed for COPD, possible TBM, anxiety, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts her at risk for developing VAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and failure to wean off the ventilator. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Airway obstruction: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which increases the risk of airway collapse and obstruction. This can be exacerbated by factors such as increased secretions or swelling.

2. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and immobility, she is at a higher risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum, is essential.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots. The use of pneumatic boots and subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis is a good measure, but regular assessment for symptoms like calf pain, swelling, or shortness of breath should be done.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia (high sodium levels). Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is crucial to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

5. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently well"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note includes several important details.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on 2179-11-22 at 12:46 PM. During this procedure, the patient was placed back on valsartan and discontinued from enalapril. The bronchoscopist and intensivist did not identify any interventions to be performed. The patient's swallowing ability needs to be evaluated further, and they were tried on a PM valve with decent results. It is planned to contact the speech therapist again to assess the patient's ability to swallow.

The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), keflex (cephalexin monohydrate), Levaquin (levofloxacin), and Actonel (risedronate sodium). The last dose of antibiotics was administered.

The patient received various infusions and ICU medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. Other medications were also given, with changes made to the medical and family history.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and more. The patient's weight, height, total intake and output, and blood product transfusions are also documented.

The respiratory support information indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV via"

   show that airways would benefit from stent as TBM is more distal. NIF
   low at 23 on [**11-21**], no other signs of  muscular weakness so likely just
   due to extended intubation but will monitor for other signs of
   weakness. If that occurs, consider EMG/NCS.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and failure to wean from the ventilator. She is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation with a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 74-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/80 mmHg to 200/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety, hypernatremia (high sodium), hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and airway obstruction. She is also at risk for complications such as failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheomalacia/bronchomalacia, and muscular weakness due to extended intubation. 

Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. She has a PICC line and an arterial line in place for ICU care. The plan is to discharge her to rehab once she recovers and follows up in a few months."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent intubation and tracheostomy. The patient attempted a test for weaning from the ventilator yesterday but required being put back on the ventilator due to increased work of breathing. The patient has allergies to sulfa, Keflex, Levaquin, and Actonel. She is currently on several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, insulin sliding scale, fluticasone, albuterol/atrovent, diltiazem, Lipitor, ASA, vitamin D, lasix, and valsartan. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

24-hour events:
The patient had an episode of IP bronchospasm yesterday due to bronchomalacia, but no intervention was possible. She also attempted a trial of spontaneous breathing (TM trial) yesterday, which resulted in an immediate increase in work of breathing and required her to be put back on the ventilator.

Vital signs:
Her current temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate is 74 bpm, blood pressure is 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. Her weight is 114.4 kg.
