","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. She presented to the ICU with urethral bleeding and a recent history of urethral polyp excision. The patient experienced hypotension and required blood transfusion. She was transferred to the ICU for further management and received empiric ciprofloxacin coverage due to gastrointestinal manipulation.

24-hour events include urine culture and nasal swab tests, as well as a pelvic ultrasound that revealed a hematoma. The patient had a Foley catheter placed with irrigation of a large clot and vaginal packing. She was hypotensive and experienced recurrent bleeding, leading to a drop in hematocrit from 25% to 20%. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and was transferred to another hospital unit for further management.

The patient's medical allergies include amoxicillin, dilantin, adhesive tape, atenolol, lisinopril, and sulfa. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current urethral bleed. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/49 to 135/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with MMP presents with hematuria in setting of recent urethral
   polypectomy.
   Agree with managing hematuria with close h/h monitoring, with
   transfusion goal > 24, maintaining ;large bore PIV access, holding
   plavix. Her hypotension resolved with IVF and blood and she remains HD
   stable.  Urology and uro gyn are following.  As her foley is clotted,
   will need larger foley or 3 way for continuous irrigation.  Keep NPO as
   may go to OR for more definitive management of probable
   post-polypectomy urethral bleed.  Will continue empiric antibx coverage
   for pos u/a given manipulation of GU system and high risk for
   bacteremia.  F/u cx data.  Will change maintenance IVF from NS  to LR
   given [**Female First Name (un) **].  Cr remains at baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical problems, currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with hematuria and has a history of bleeding 7 days after a polypectomy from the urethra. The bleeding is likely from the urethra or bladder. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday and her hemoglobin level has increased appropriately. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient also has bacteriuria, which may be due to contamination or a true infection. She is currently on ciprofloxacin 500mg every 24 hours.

Her blood pressure is stable, and she is being continued on her home dose of amlodipine for hypertension.

The patient has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.0-1.3. Her current creatinine level is 0.7, likely due to pre-renal causes from poor oral intake. She is receiving intravenous fluids and will be monitored closely. If her creatinine level worsens, she will undergo urine electrolyte analysis and renal ultrasound.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not currently anticoagulated due to a past subdural hematoma. She is being paced and will continue to be monitored on telemetry.

The patient has hypothyroidism, stable on home levothyroxine.

ICU care includes NPO status for possible surgery, glycemic control"

The patient is hemodynamically stable, but her Hct should be rechecked every 6 hours. A Foley catheter has been placed for tamponade, and Plavix has been held. 

The patient also has bacteriuria, which may be a true infection or contamination after manipulation in the emergency department (ED). She received ciprofloxacin (Cipro) 500mg every 24 hours and will be followed up on urinary culture (UCx). 

Her blood pressure is stable, and she is continuing with her home dose of amlodipine. She has chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.0-1.3), which has worsened to 0.7. This is likely pre-renal due to poor oral intake, and she is currently receiving intravenous fluids (IVF). If her creatinine does not improve after IVF, she will be evaluated for urine electrolytes and renal ultrasound. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated due to a past"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including hypertension, anemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with hematuria, which is likely due to bleeding from the urethra or bladder. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable. Foley catheter has been placed for tamponade, and Plavix has been held. The patient is also being monitored for possible surgery in the morning and is on NPO status.

She has a history of bacteriuria, but it is unclear if it is a true infection or contamination after manipulation in the emergency department. She did receive ciprofloxacin in the ED, and plans include repeating urine analysis and urine culture in the morning. The antibiotic given for bacteriuria has been held, and follow-up urine culture is planned.

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, and she will continue with her home dose of amlodipine. Her chronic kidney disease is at baseline levels of 1.3, and she is expected to trend back to baseline. She will continue to receive IV fluids overnight and if her condition worsens, urine electrolytes and renal ultrasound will be done.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated due to a past subdural hematoma. She is being paced and will be monitored on telemetry.

","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with multiple medical problems, presenting with hematuria. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, anemia, acute blood loss secondary to hemorrhage, bacteriuria, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent a polypectomy from the urethra and started on Plavix two days prior to the bleeding. A Foley catheter was placed to tamponade the bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped to 20 today but increased to 23 after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC). The plan is to transfuse additional one unit of pRBC overnight to maintain a target Hct of over 24 and recheck the Hct in the morning. The Foley catheter will be continued for tamponade, and Plavix will be held. The possibility of surgery in the morning is being considered, and the patient will be kept nil per os (NPO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to a drop in her Hct levels. This can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Further blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain adequate Hct levels.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has positive urine analysis results, which could indicate a UTI. However, it is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypothyroidism. She presents with hematuria following a urethral polyp excision and restarting Plavix. 

The patient has been stable overnight with a stable hematocrit level. She has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and has had her Foley catheter replaced with a larger one due to small clots and bloody return. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.7Â°C (96.2Â°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/41 mmHg to 169/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hematuria. 

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with crackles in the chest, and diminished peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologically, she is alert, attentive, and follows simple commands.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with multiple medical problems. She underwent a cystoscopy with polypectomy and experienced hypotension with low urine output post-procedure. The patient received fluid boluses and responded slightly, and one unit of blood was transfused to increase her blood pressure. Her bicarb level was low, so an arterial blood gas (ABG) was drawn.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/35 mmHg to 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on AV pacing.

The patient's weight has increased from 44.5 kg at admission to 50.7 kg currently. Her fluid balance shows a total input of 4,705 mL and output of 1,225 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,480 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 4.6 to 6.2 thousand/mm3, hematocrit levels between 27.7% and 33.7%, platelet count ranging from 87 to 114 thousand/mm3, creatinine levels between 0.7 and 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 72 and 92 mg/dL, and various electrolyte levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44.5 kg (admission) / 50.7 kg (current) adult who was admitted with an altered mental status, post-op cystoscopy, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns regarding potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has an altered mental status, but it is described as not being delirium. However, delirium is still a potential complication that should be monitored for.
2. Infection: Given the prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines, the patient is at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although prophylaxis measures are in place, the patient is still at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of acute anemia secondary to blood loss. While the bleeding has been controlled, ongoing monitoring is required to prevent further complications.
5. Medication adverse effects: Some of the medications the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and anemia who underwent cystoscopy with polypectomy in the late afternoon. Post-procedure, she experienced hypotension and low urine output, which were initially managed with fluid boluses but required a blood transfusion to improve blood pressure. Her bicarbonate level was low, prompting an arterial blood gas analysis. The patient has multiple allergies and is currently on several medications, including antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and antihypertensives. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, although her blood pressure remains on the lower side. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with oxygen supplementation. Her weight has increased since admission. Fluid balance shows an input-output discrepancy. Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has altered mental status but is not delirious. She has a history of anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, and is currently on full code status in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation suggests ongoing hemodynamic instability, which may"

","The patient is an elderly female with multiple medical problems who underwent a cystoscopy with polypectomy. Post-procedure, the patient experienced hypotension and low urine output. The patient received LR fluid boluses and responded slightly, but then required a blood transfusion to increase blood pressure. The patient's bicarb level was low, so an ABG was drawn.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, bacteriuria, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. The anemia is believed to be due to acute blood loss from the urethra or less likely bladder, as there is ongoing hematuria. The patient has received 2 units of PRBCs and is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient also has bacteriuria, but it is unclear if it is a true infection or contamination. The patient has been on ciprofloxacin 500mg q24h since the ED. The patient's hypertension is currently stable, and she is being continued on her home dose of amlodipine.

The patient's chronic kidney disease has returned to baseline at 1.3 after IVF, but her current BUN is at 0.7. This is likely pre-renal due to poor oral intake. The patient is NPO in the ICU.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical problems who underwent a cystoscopy with polypectomy. Post-procedure, she experienced hypotension and low urine output. She received fluid boluses and responded slightly, and then a unit of blood was transfused which increased her blood pressure. Her bicarbonate level was low, so an arterial blood gas (ABG) was drawn.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/48 to 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's weight is 50.7 kg, and she has received a total of 4,705 mL of fluids including 4,355 mL of intravenous fluids, 350 mL of blood products, and 1,211 mL of output including 1,100 mL of urine. 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 25, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 77%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 14. 

Physical examination findings include an elderly female appearing frail but normal airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), clear lungs, no jugular venous distention (JVD) or cervical lymph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical problems who presents with hematuria following a recent urethral polypectomy. She was hypotensive after cystoscopy but has now stabilized. Her hematuria has resolved and her vital signs are stable. She has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, but her condition is not consistent with sepsis as she remains afebrile without leukocytosis and has normal lactate levels. The plan is to continue monitoring her hemodynamic status, aim for a transfusion goal of >24, maintain large bore peripheral intravenous access, and hold Plavix. The patient's respiratory status is good, but there is evidence of vascular congestion on imaging. She has both metabolic acidosis (NAG and MG) with appropriate respiratory compensation on ABG, likely due to being NPO and receiving normal saline. Monitor electrolytes and urine output. Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with cipro, given manipulation of the genitourinary system, although her urine culture is negative. Additional urology recommendations. In the ICU, the patient is on two peripheral intravenous lines, boots, advanced diet, and full code status. The rest of the plan is outlined in the resident's note. The patient is stable for transfer to the [Female First Name (un)] floor. Total time spent: 40 minutes.
