","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures, who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a catheter and subsequent operative repair. The patient's current conditions include gross hematuria, diarrhea, suprapubic pain, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and seizures. The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities and previous admissions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although the blood pressure is slightly elevated. The patient is receiving various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Given the patient's history of bladder ruptures and current symptoms of gross hematuria and suprapubic pain, there is a risk of developing a UTI. Monitoring for signs of infection and conducting cultures are important to prevent and manage this complication.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and rectal pain raise concerns for C. diff infection, especially considering the recent antibiotic use. Testing for C. diff and implementing appropriate treatment strategies are necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Pressure Ulcers: The presence of a stage II decubitus ulcer indicates a risk for developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning, wound care, and preventing prolonged periods of immob"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. The patient has gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder. He is currently being managed with suprapubic irrigation, and his Hct levels are stable. The patient is also experiencing suprapubic pain, which is believed to be secondary to cystitis and/or post-operative pain. He is being monitored for pain and follow-up cultures are planned. The patient's labs indicate anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels. His baseline Hct is 25-27. Active tissue and stool studies are being conducted, and he is starting iron supplementation with a bowel regimen. His heart rate and rhythm are abnormal, showing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is being continued on metoprolol tartrate IV prn. The patient's renal function has been impaired since May 31st, with creatinine levels as high as 2.3 and now decreasing to 1.4. This is believed to be due to gentamicin toxicity precipitated by infection/sepsis during his previous admission. His blood pressure is slightly elevated, and he is being continued on metoprolol tartrate. The patient has diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c of 7.1 in 2012. He is being continued on lant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who underwent operative repair for an intraperitoneal bladder rupture. The patient was sent from another hospital for bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hematuria: The patient has gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder due to previous ruptures. The hemoglobin level is stable, so it is reassuring. However, further clarification with urology regarding the setup of the three-way catheter is needed. The plan includes running the CBI through the suprapubic catheter, performing q 1-hour bladder checks, and deferring antibiotics.
2. Suprapubic Pain: The patient's pain may be secondary to cystitis and/or post-operative pain. Monitoring pain and following up with cultures is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels. The patient was transfused 1U PRBC for a hematocrit of 20 with an appropriate response (25). The plan includes active T&S, Fe repletion, monitoring Hct, and checking for guaiacol stools.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR on EKG. Continuing metoprolol via G-tube is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who underwent operative repair for an intraperitoneal bladder rupture. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation hospital due to bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. The patient's current condition includes gross hematuria, tenuous bladder, stable hematocrit, suprapubic pain, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, liquid stool/anal discomfort, renal failure, hypertension, and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient presents with gross hematuria, which may indicate a possible urinary tract infection or bleeding from the bladder rupture site. Close monitoring and further evaluation by urology are recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient's labs indicate anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels. It is necessary to continue monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels, initiate iron repletion therapy, and perform ongoing transfusion and stool guaiac testing.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which requires continued management with metoprolol through the gastric tube.
4. Liquid Stool/Anal Discomfort: The patient is experiencing liquid stools and anal discomfort. Holding the bowel regimen, rechecking optimal bowel feeds, and considering anoscopy are recommended. Additionally, checking for Clostridium difficile infection and providing nutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. The patient has gross hematuria and tenuous bladder control. His hemoglobin levels are stable. The patient also has suprapubic pain, which may be secondary to cystitis and/or post-operative pain. Other issues include anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure, hypertension, and a history of seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient's gross hematuria and history of bladder ruptures increase the risk of further bleeding and potential complications related to the urinary tract.
2. Suprapubic Pain: The patient's suprapubic pain could lead to discomfort and potential complications such as urinary tract infections or worsening cystitis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels requires further investigation and management to prevent worsening anemia and associated complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's history of renal failure requires careful monitoring of kidney function and avoidance of nephrotoxic substances to prevent further deterioration.

24-hour events include:
- Urology: The patient had a central line infection (CBI) which was discharged as urine clear and tolerated well.
- GI: The patient experienced profuse liquid stools. A consultation with surgery revealed a posterior anal fissure. Measures were taken to keep the stool soft, avoid rectal tube use, and apply topical nitroglycerin as needed. A bag was placed on the rectum to prevent decubitus ulcer formation. Stool samples were sent for Clostridium difficile.
- Neuro: The patient's Dilantin level remained low. Neurology prescribed an IV infusion of 500 mg of Dilantin, which the patient tolerated well. The infusion was completed at 2:30 am, and plans were made to recheck the levels in the morning.
- Post transfusion HCT stable
- Lantus decreased due to low am blood sugar

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin, oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Ritalin, and remeron.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who was admitted to the ICU due to bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. The patient presented with gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder. The patient's Hct (hematocrit) is stable. The patient has been managed with operative repair of an intraperitoneal bladder rupture and insertion of a suprapubic tube and Foley catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient's history of bladder ruptures increases the risk of recurrent bleeding and hematuria.
2. C. difficile diarrhea: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and may require discontinuation of certain antibiotics.
3. Anal fissure: The patient has developed an anal fissure, which can cause pain and may require surgical intervention.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels. This may require ongoing management and supplementation.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient is experiencing AFib/RVR, which can lead to poor perfusion and potential complications such as stroke.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated since May 31st, indicating possible renal failure. This requires careful monitoring and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures, who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter. The patient has gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder due to previous ruptures. His hemoglobin levels are stable. The urology recommendations include running the catheter through the suprapubic catheter, performing q1 hour bladder checks, and deferring antibiotics.

The patient is experiencing suprapubic pain, which is likely secondary to cystitis and/or post-operative pain. Pain monitoring and follow-up cultures are recommended.

The patient has anemia, with labs indicating anemia of chronic disease but low iron levels. He received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells and responded appropriately with a hematocrit level of 25%. Active transfusion and iron repletion, as well as monitoring the hematocrit level and stool guaiac, are advised.

The patient is diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on EKG. Metoprolol administration via G-tube is continued.

The patient has liquid stool and anal discomfort. The bowel regimen is held, and optimal bowel feeds are rechecked. Anoscopy is recommended prior to placement of Flex-o-seal. Clostridium difficile testing is also recommended.

The patient's renal function has been impaired since May 31st, with creatinine levels ranging from 1"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures, who underwent operative repair for an intraperitoneal bladder rupture and had insertion of a suprapubic tube and Foley catheter. He was admitted to the ICU due to bleeding from a three-way catheter and suprapubic catheter, complicated by Clostridium difficile (c. dif) infection. The patient's current condition includes hematuria, suprapubic pain, non-gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, c. dif with anal discomfort, renal failure, hypertension, and seizures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient has gross hematuria, which may be due to his tenuous bladder and history of ruptures. Close monitoring of Hct levels and urology recommendations are necessary.
2. Suprapubic Pain: The patient experiences pain in the suprapubic region, which could be secondary to cystitis and/or postoperative pain. Pain monitoring and follow-up cultures are recommended.
3. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has low serum HCO3 levels, likely caused by c. dif and high stool output. Treating the underlying c. dif is essential.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to chronic disease but with low iron levels. He has received blood transfusions and should continue to be monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a three-way catheter and subsequent complications. The patient underwent operative repair for an intraperitoneal bladder rupture on [**2176-6-4**] and had a suprapubic tube and Foley catheter inserted. The patient's current conditions include gross hematuria, tenuous bladder, suprapubic pain, non-gap acidosis, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Clostridium difficile infection (c. dif), anal fissure, renal failure, hypertension, and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria: The patient presents with gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder, indicating a risk of further bleeding or urinary tract infection.
2. Suprapubic Pain: The patient's suprapubic pain may be secondary to cystitis and/or postoperative pain. Monitoring pain levels and following up with cultures are recommended.
3. Non-gap Acidosis: The patient has low serum bicarbonate levels, suggesting non-gap acidosis. Treating the underlying c. dif infection is essential in addressing this condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's labs indicate anemia of chronic disease with low iron levels. Blood transfusion has been administered, and monitoring hemoglobin levels is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y.o. M with a history of bladder ruptures x 2, s/p intraperitoneal
   bladder rupture managed by operative repair on [**2176-6-4**] with insertion of
   suprapubic tube and foley catheter, sent from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab for bleeding
   from 3-way catether and suprapubic catheter course now complicated by
   c. dif.
   > Hematuria: Pt with gross hematuria and tenuous bladder given history
   of ruptures.  Reassuringly Hct stable.  Now off CBI
   - appreciate urology recs
   - Run CBI through suprapubic catheter
   - q 1 hour bladder checks
    > Suprapubic Pain: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to cystititis and/or post
   operative pain
   - monitor pain
   - f/u cultures
   > Non gap acidosis: with low serum HCO3 likely [**3-4**] c. dif and high
   stool output.
   - treat underlying  c. dif
   > Anemia: Labs in [**2176**] c/w anemia of chronic disease but iron low.
   Recent baseline Hct 25-27. Transfused 1U PRBC for Hct of 20 with
   appropriate response (25).  Transfused an extra unit [**7-10**].
   - monitor Hct
   > Afib with RVR: on EKG
   - continue metoprolol via G tube
   > c. dif / anal discomfort : Has anal fissue (conservative managemt)
   and now c. dif positive
   -treatment for c. dif with metronidazole
   - banana flakes
   - nutrition recs
   > Renal Failure: Since [**2176-5-31**], Cr has been as high as 2.3 and now
   decreasing to Cr 1.4.  At previous admission, thought to be due to
   gentamicin toxicity precipitated by infection/sepsis.
   - trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications
   > Hypertension: Slightly elevated
   - continue metoprolol tartrate
   > Seizures: Occured on recent admission to ICU in [**2176-5-31**] where EEG
   showed possible non-convulsive status epilepticus.  Was to follow up
   with neurology
   - continue phenytoin 125 mg po TID
   - monitor phenytoin
   - seizure precautions

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of bladder ruptures, who underwent operative repair of an intraperitoneal bladder rupture and insertion of a suprapubic tube and foley catheter. He was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from a 3-way catheter and suprapubic catheter, complicated by c. diff.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hematuria: The patient has gross hematuria and a tenuous bladder due to his history of ruptures. His Hct is stable, and he is off CBI. Urology recommendations should be appreciated, and CBI should be run through the suprapubic catheter. Q1 hour bladder checks should be performed.

2. Suprapubic Pain: The patient experiences pain in the suprapubic region secondary to cystitis and/or postoperative pain. Pain should be monitored, and follow-up cultures should be done.

3. Non-gap acidosis: The patient has low serum HCO3 likely due to c. diff and high stool output. The underlying c. diff should be treated.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, but iron levels are low. He has received a transfusion of 1U PRBC for a Hct of 20, with an appropriate response (25). An extra unit should be transfused on [**7-10**]. Hct should be monitored.

5. Afib with RVR:"
