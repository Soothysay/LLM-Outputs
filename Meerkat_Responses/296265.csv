   RBC scan to localize bleeding.  While at  tagged RBC scan, he had start
   of a continuous large BRBPR.  He became tachycardic and his BP dropped,
   necessitating start of pressors.   Massive transfusion protocol
   initiated.  I was present in nuclear medicine to evaluate him along
   with ICU resident.  He then went to IR where [**Female First Name (un) 2712**] bleeding seen.  In IR,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who is currently admitted to the ICU for GI bleed and blood loss anemia. The patient experienced another episode of BRBPR (blood-tinged or brownish red vomit and/or blood-tinged or dark red stool) this morning after undergoing an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) procedure. No source was found for the bleeding during the EGD and flexible sigmoidoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/68 to 127/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress noted during the general appearance assessment. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender. Neurological examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 7.7 K/uL, platelet count of 145 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21.3 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose level of 98 mg/dL, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and chloride level of 98 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include several issues. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and a recent seizure. The primary concern is GI bleed/blood loss anemia, for which a tagged red blood cell scan is planned to localize the bleeding site and potentially guide angiographic intervention. The patient is also at risk for alcohol withdrawal, and benzodiazepines will be administered based on CIWA scores. Other issues are managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further bleeding, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, infections due to invasive procedures and devices, organ dysfunction (such as renal or hepatic), and potential cardiovascular complications related to the patient's history of EtOH abuse and current critical illness."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse.
- He presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and blood loss anemia.
- The patient experienced another episode of blood-tinged respiratory secretions per rectum (BRBPR) this morning after an endoscopy, with no source found.
- He received a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan to potentially direct an angiographic solution to the GI bleed.
- The patient had a continuous large BRBPR, leading to tachycardia and hypotension, necessitating the start of pressors.
- A massive transfusion protocol was initiated, and the patient received 30 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of platelets.
- He underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure where a puncture of the aortic wall was performed, requiring balloon tamponade for hemostasis.
- Vascular surgery evaluated the patient but did not perform any further repair at that time.
- The patient has been seen several times by general surgery throughout the course.
- He is critically ill, requiring close monitoring and multiple interventions to manage his condition.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin.
- Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 145 K/uL.
- The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and he is on vasopressin and pantoprazole infusions.
- The plan includes frequent Hct checks, potential angiographic solution to the GI bleed, monitoring for signs of alcohol withdrawal, and close observation by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing episodes of GI bleeding pose a significant risk for continued blood loss and potential complications such as hypotension, shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's drop in blood pressure and tachycardia indicate potential hypovolemia due to blood loss, which can lead to hypovolemic shock if not promptly managed.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to alcohol abuse and critical illness increases the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infections.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse raises concerns for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest with symptoms like agitation, seizures, and autonomic instability.
5. Organ dysfunction: Prolonged hypotension and inadequate perfusion can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular collapse.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of bleeding, including one after an endoscopy procedure. Despite the endoscopy, no source of bleeding was found.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate ranging from 84-104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/68 mmHg to 127/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 145 K/uL, normal glucose level of 98 mg/dL, slightly elevated potassium level of 6 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving vasopressin and pantoprazole infusions, as well as other ICU medications as per the resident's orders. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia ("
