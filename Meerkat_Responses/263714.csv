","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleeding, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, leukopenia, tachycardia, fevers (and hypotension), positive peritoneal and blood cultures for gram-negative organisms, lactate level of 7.2, likely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), known urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient is receiving antibiotics to cover gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes. The patient's other medical issues include anemia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, ESLD, hyperbilirubinemia, altered mental status (AMS), and portal vein thrombosis. The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including vasopressor support, intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, proton pump inhibitors, and lactulose. Potential medical complications that can arise include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleeding and later complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has tachycardia, fevers, and hypotension, with white blood cell count up to 6. Peritoneal and blood cultures positive for gram-negative bacteria. Lactate levels are elevated at 7.2. There is a suspicion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient is already receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics to cover gram-negative organisms, including multidrug-resistant strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBLs), but these may be missed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has rising creatinine levels and low urine output. This is likely due to pre-renal causes related to sepsis and hypotension rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is concern about the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in the setting of cirrhosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. The patient developed hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient's condition has been improving, with reduced pressor requirements, no fever, and falling lactates from 7 to 2.8. The source of sepsis is positive peritoneal and blood cultures for gram-negative organisms. The patient is currently on day 3 of Zosyn to cover gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis from multiple possible sources, as indicated by positive peritoneal and blood cultures for gram-negative organisms. The patient is responding well to treatment with Zosyn.
2. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient has rising creatinine levels and low urine output. This is likely due to prerenal etiology given the response to fluids and low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa). In the setting of cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), there is concern about the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient will undergo fluid challenges with albumin and assess urine output response with a goal of 30 cc/hr.

   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.
   #. Sepsis: Improving, off pressors.  Afebrile, with lactates falling
   from 7-> 2.4.  Source: peritoneal and blood cultures positive for
   Klebsiella and GNR anaerobes.  GN and anaerobes.
   - Levophed prn MAP >60
   - narrow coverage to ceftriaxone
   - daily surveillance cultures until negative X 72 hrs
   - avoid IVF as he currently has pulmonary edema
   - trend daily lactate
   - f/u cultures
   - hold BP meds
   # ESLD: worsening coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin but hold spironolactone, lasix,
   nadolol
   - Goals of care:address with  is pt a transplant candidate?
   # Oliguric acute renal failure: 1.2 -> 2.2 : Cr rising with low UOP.
   Unresponsive to fluids.  Low FeNa, low urine sodium, in setting of
   cirrhosis and SBP, concern about HRS.  Maintain BP.
   - continue thru day 3 of albumin
   - start midodrine and octreotide
   - hold fluid, hold albumin given acute pulmonary edema and respiratory
   distress
   - continue lasix
   - tx underlying sepsis
   - renal dosing of meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   #Respiratory distress - pulmonary edema from volume resucitation vs
   ARDS in setting of acute sepsis.  Supporting pulmonary edema is his
   stable O2 saturday Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%).
   - Pulm edema - attempt diuresis with lasix boluses.  avoid IVF.
   - ARDS - if pulmonary status continues to worsen, and pt requiring
   increased O2, strong suspicion should be given to ARDS with urgent
   intubation
   # Anemia: Transfused one unit with no bump in Hct.  Jump in Hct
   yesterday likely due to lab error or volume shifts and back to
   baseline.   Differential is GI source (has portal gastropathy on prior
   EGD) versus DIC (lower suspicion as platelets stable).
   - trend coags
   - trend hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue PPI
   - maintain active T+S
   - tranfuse for HCt < 21.
   # h/o variceal bleed - Pt may require NG tube given reduced mental
   status and ability to take po.  Continuing only essential medications
   orally.  NG tube was deferred yesterday given h/o varicies and risk of
   rupture.
   - d/w Liver re: placement of NG tube
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - maintain INR< 3 and platelets>50
   # Coagulopathy: INR jumped from 2 to 5.2. Platelets stable.  In the
   setting of concurrent thrombocytopenia, anemia, fibrinogen low,
   +schistos, rising Tbili, low hapto concern for DIC, although difficult
   to evaluate in setting of cirrhosis and sepsis.
   -Follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   -FFP to maintian INR <3 given recent GI bleed, acute blood loss anemia
   - Transfuse platelets < 50
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy versus delirium secondary to
   underlying infection.  Now complicated by acute respiratory distress
   which may be causing an acute delirium.
   -Continue lactulose (was held this AM secondary to 3 L of stool output)
   - tx of respiratory distress
   #Electrolyte abnormalities
   -1) Hypernatremia - likely due to heavy GI diuresis with lactulose.
   Would like to give free water boluses orally in [**Doctor Last Name **] of through IV
   given volume over load state and pulmonary edema.  4L free water
   deficit.
   - encourage po fluid intake
   - NG tube to administer fluids
   2)Hypokalemia -  Also thought to be [**1-4**] to agressive GI output from
   lactulose and contraction alkalolsis.  Continues to require lactulose
   for hepatic encephalopathy.
   - continue aggressive repletion.
   3)Hypercalcemia - 12.04 corrected calcium.  Would treat with aggressive
   IVF, but will defer this tx in the acute setting given tenuous
   repiratory function.   Ddx broad, most likely hyperparathyroidism or
   malignancy.
   - check PTH with AM labs
   - if respiratory status stable - would  aggressively diurese
   4) Anion  gap acidosis - Combination of poor lactate excretion and
   acute renal failure.
   - follow lactates
   - trend AG
   - follow renal function
   #Hyperbilirubinemia - elevation of direct and indirect bilirubin.
   Elevation of direct bilirubin suggests hemolysis, perhaps as coponent
   of DIC.  FDP pending.  U/S  on [**9-3**] showed stable thrombosis of the
   left portal vein.  The main portal vein and right portal vein
   demonstrate patency with very slow flow.  Also cholithiasis.
   - trend daily liver enzymes and Bili
   - low threshold to repeat abdominal u/s
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Documented at OSH and previous ultrasounds at
   [**Hospital1 1**]. INR > 5; no anticoagulation indicated.
   # FEN: TID lytes / NPO given mental status

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed and subsequently developed multiple complications. 

The patient's current conditions include dyspnea (shortness of breath), sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure (acute), and hypotension (not in shock). The patient also has a history of variceal bleed, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's chest X-ray revealed bilateral fluffy infiltrates. Fluid cultures grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and GNR anaerobes. 

The patient's treatment plan involves narrow-spectrum antibiotics, daily surveillance cultures, avoiding intravenous fluids due to pulmonary edema, and close monitoring of lactate levels. The patient is also receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, midodrine and octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), diuretics for pulmonary edema, and renal dosing of medications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, coagulopathy, and electrolyte abnormalities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. He developed hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and sepsis from multiple sources, including peritoneal and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella and GNR anaerobes. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with the following diagnoses: dyspnea (shortness of breath), sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure (acute renal failure), and hypotension (not shock).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection becomes dysregulated. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and there is a concern for ARDS, a serious lung condition that can develop after severe infections or injury. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and is associated with high mortality rates.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. This condition can result in confusion, altered mental status, and coma if not properly managed.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol use and cirrhosis. He was admitted with septic shock due to Klebsiella SBP/bacteremia and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes worsening pulmonary edema, hypotension, altered mental status, and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening pulmonary edema as indicated by the CXR and clinical picture. If left untreated, this can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is making oral intake risky for aspiration. If not managed properly, hepatic encephalopathy can worsen, leading to increased confusion, altered levels of consciousness, and potential coma.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels. If not appropriately managed, hypercalcemia can cause various complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure. If not addressed promptly, this condition can progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

5. Infection: Despite being off pressors, the patient is still at risk of developing new infections due to his compromised immune system. Infections can worsen sepsis and lead to organ dysfunction.

It is crucial to closely monitor and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. He developed hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and was transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. He is currently improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling. The source of infection is identified as peritoneal and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to multiple sources of infection, including peritoneal and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Continuous monitoring of mental status and urine output is recommended. Pressors may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Surveillance blood cultures should also be conducted.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic abnormalities, infection, hypotension, and concern for hemorrhage. A CT head should be performed, and lactulose should be given for hepatic encephalopathy. Inability to take oral medication may necessitate rectal administration.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, but urine output is adequate at 123 cc/hr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed and subsequently developed hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed.

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is improving as indicated by being off pressors, afebrile, and with falling lactate levels. The source of infection appears to be peritoneal and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy has been changed to ceftriaxone.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, but urine output is adequate at 123cc/hr. The fractional excretion of urea (FE urea) is 44%, suggesting prerenal etiology with a possible component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Given the patient's cirrhosis and recent episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), there is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), but it is unlikely at this time.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 151, with a free water deficit of 3.3L. The patient received 2L"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of EtOH (alcohol) abuse and cirrhosis.
- He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by Klebsiella SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and bacteremia.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- His examination and chest X-ray show signs of ongoing pulmonary edema.
- The patient is currently stable and off pressors.
- His serum creatinine level is stable, indicating continued efforts at diuresis.
- He is still concerned for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema.
- The patient has delirium/encephalopathy and a poor mental status.
- He has hypernatremia and hypercalcemia.
- The patient is anemic and will have serial Hcts (hematocrits) to monitor.
- Other issues include potential DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening sepsis/septic shock: The patient is still at risk for complications related to his initial infection, including further deterioration in organ function and potential septic shock.
2. Progression of acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, leading to worsening kidney dysfunction and potential need"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.
   -TRALI seems less likely: last transfusion [**9-18**], progression of CXRs,
   looks too bad to be 4 days out: will need blood bank consult tomorrow
   for investigation
   #. Sepsis: Improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling
   from 7-> 2.0.  Source: peritoneal and blood cultures positive for
   Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Urine Cx negative.  On ceftriaxone, day 5 of
   abx.  Will need to complete 2 wk course after first negative blood
   culture.
   -Continue abx as above
   -f/u surveillance blood cxs
   -hold BP meds, including diuretics
   #Hypoxia - Last blood gas 7.38, 32,  69 on 5 L O2 NC.  Underlying CXR
   suggestive of diffuse upper lobe disease bilaterally; CT confirms
   diffuse bilateral disease, w/ predilection for upper lobes and apices
   in ""crazy pavement pattern"" with interlobar thickening, although some
   involvement of RL lobe w/ ground glass pattern.   Diff dx is alveolar
   hemorrhage vs infectious process vs transfusion related lung injury.
   -For possibility of TRALI:  Generally, TRALI starts within 1-2 hrs of
   tranfusion and has occurred within 6 hours of transfusion and resolves
   in average of 4 days. Received 2 U on [**9-15**] unit on [**9-18**], and 1
   unit on [**9-19**]. Abnormalities picked up on CXR on [**9-19**] in evening, seem
   less significant on morning of [**9-19**].  What makes this less likely is
   that his CT is quite poor w/ continued diffuse disease 3 days after
   suspected insult, however, it is not unheard of for a minority of
   patients to have persistent disease within 1 wk of insult.  Tx is
   supportive: there is insufficient data to recommend steroid
   administration, so would hold off on steroids, especially since
   infection is on differential.
   -Given infectious etiology is a possibility, currently expanded
   coverage to vancomycin + ceftriaxone.  On day 2 of vanc, would complete
   8 day course for vanc, 2 week course for ceftriaxone.
   -Ruling out influenza
   -Started lasix drip yesterday; unclear if CT could be consistent w/
   pulmonary edema, is +7 L, clinically has extremity edema; would
   continue diuresis w/ goal of -1 L today as renal function continues to
   improve.  Follow Is and Os tonight, and repeat Cr; if elevation,
   consider D/c drip.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Diff dx is hepatic encephalopathy versus
   delirium from underlying infection vs vascular event.
   - Give lactulose for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue vancomycin + ceftriaxone to tx underlying infection
   - F/u surveillance cultures, urine cultures
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.2 -> 1.8 -> 1.4.  FE Urea 44%, renal
   consult obtained: likely prerenal etiology but also some component of
   ATN, given hx of hypoTN.  Hepatorenal less likely given response to
   fluids.
   -asked renal about RBC casts in urine, given high number of RBCs and ?
   of pulm hemorrhage; they felt RBCs were present but not dysmorphic, no

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. The patient's condition has been complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and sepsis from multiple possible sources.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling from 7 to 2.0. Source of sepsis is positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in peritoneal and blood cultures. The patient is currently on ceftriaxone and will need to complete a 2-week course after the first negative blood culture.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 138, indicating respiratory distress. The chest X-ray and CT scan show diffuse upper lobe disease bilaterally with a ""crazy pavement"" pattern. This finding suggests alveolar hemorrhage, infectious process, or transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is less likely given the persistent disease on CT scan 3 days after suspected insult. Supportive treatment is recommended.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated. Free water flushes are being continued, and additional free water will be given if the sodium level is above 150.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.
   -TRALI seems less likely: last transfusion [**9-18**], progression of CXRs,
   looks too bad to be 4 days out: will need blood bank consult tomorrow
   for investigation
   #. Sepsis: Improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling
   from 7-> 2.0.  Source: peritoneal and blood cultures positive for
   Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Urine Cx negative.  On ceftriaxone, day 5 of
   abx.  Will need to complete 2 wk course after first negative blood
   culture.
   -Continue abx as above
   -f/u surveillance blood cxs
   -hold BP meds, including diuretics
   #Hypoxia - Last blood gas 7.38, 32,  69 on 5 L O2 NC.  Underlying CXR
   suggestive of diffuse upper lobe disease bilaterally; CT confirms
   diffuse bilateral disease, w/ predilection for upper lobes and apices
   in ""crazy pavement pattern"" with interlobar thickening, although some
   involvement of RL lobe w/ ground glass pattern.   Diff dx is alveolar
   hemorrhage vs infectious process vs transfusion related lung injury.
   -For possibility of TRALI:  Generally, TRALI starts within 1-2 hrs of
   tranfusion and has occurred within 6 hours of transfusion and resolves
   in average of 4 days. Received 2 U on [**9-15**] unit on [**9-18**], and 1
   unit on [**9-19**]. Abnormalities picked up on CXR on [**9-19**] in evening, seem
   less significant on morning of [**9-19**].  What makes this less likely is
   that his CT is quite poor w/ continued diffuse disease 3 days after
   suspected insult, however, it is not unheard of for a minority of
   patients to have persistent disease within 1 wk of insult.  Tx is
   supportive: there is insufficient data to recommend steroid
   administration, so would hold off on steroids, especially since
   infection is on differential.
   -Given infectious etiology is a possibility, currently expanded
   coverage to vancomycin + ceftriaxone.  On day 2 of vanc, would complete
   8 day course for vanc, 2 week course for ceftriaxone.  Need to increase
   dose of ceftriaxone for SBP doses until 5 total days of abx for SBP are
   complete, can then return to regular doses of ceftriaxone to complete 2
   wk course.
   -Ruling out influenza, legionella
   -Started lasix drip yesterday; unclear if CT could be consistent w/
   pulmonary edema, is +7 L, clinically has extremity edema; would
   continue diuresis w/ goal of -2 L today as renal function continues to
   improve.  Follow Is and Os tonight, and repeat Cr and continue diuresis
   as long as Cr is not rising.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Diff dx is hepatic encephalopathy versus
   delirium from underlying infection vs vascular event.
   - Give lactulose for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue vancomycin + ceftriaxone to tx underlying infection
   - F/u surveillance cultures, urine cultures
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.2 -> 1.8 -> 1.4.  FE Urea 44%, renal
   consult obtained: likely prerenal etiology but also some component of
   ATN, given hx of hypoTN.  Hepatorenal less likely given response to
   fluids.
   -asked renal about RBC casts in urine, given high number of RBCs and ?
   of pulm hemorrhage; they felt RBCs were present but not dysmorphic, no
   casts, so suspicion for GN very low
   - Continue to monitor UOP, almost 125 cc/hr
   - tx underlying sepsis; avoid nephrotoxic agents, avoid hypotension
   -trend daily creatinine
   .
   #Hypernatremia
   -Continue free water flushes 250q4
   -50 cc of D5W this AM; follow Na tonight and give additional free water
   if > 150
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable.  Differential is GI source (has portal
   gastropathy on prior EGD) versus DIC (lower suspicion as platelets
   stable).  Transfused 1U PRBC with appropriate Hct bump, now stable.
   - trend hct daily
   - Continue PPI
   - maintain active T+S
   - tranfuse for HCt < 21 or dropping.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis. He presented with septic shock secondary to Klebsiella SBP/bacteremia and acute renal failure, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome. His current condition includes respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening diffuse infiltrates, which could indicate ongoing pulmonary edema.
2. Transfusion reaction: The patient received a blood transfusion, and there is a possibility of a transfusion reaction.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is currently experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Infection: The patient initially presented with septic shock caused by SBP/bacteremia, indicating a risk of further infections.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms, such as diffuse infiltrates on imaging and hypoxemia, suggest the possibility of ARDS.
6. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of AST and ALT, indicating possible hepatitis.
7. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, which can worsen if not managed"

   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal

   .
   #Hypoxia - Last blood gas 7.29 39 76  on ASSIST w/ TV 550, PEEP of 5,
   FiO2 of 50%.  Initial abnormalities seen on CXR from [**9-19**]; chest CT
   showed bilateral upper lobe involvement w/ interlobar thickening and
   airspace disease in ""crazy pavement"" pattern that has progressively
   worsened over last four days, now appears to involve the entire lung
   field bilaterally.  Diff dx is infectious pneumonia versus alveolar
   hemorrhage vs transfusion related lung injury versus pulmonary edema.
   BAL yesterday was nonbloody making alveolar hemorrhage less likely;
   TRALI less likely given worsening rather than resolution; so most
   likely causes are infectious and/or pulmonary edema.
   -Currently on vancomycin + ceftriaxone: would expand coverage to
   include pseudomonas and atypicals: switch ceftriaxone to cefepime and
   add ciprofloxacin.
   -Clinically has extremity edema; Stopped lasix drip as UOP seems to
   have dropped off and Cr has risen from 1.4 -> 1.9.  Unable to diurese
   given oliguria.  Need resolution of oliguria per below for further
   management of pulm edema.
   .
   #Oliguria and renal failure:  Cr has risen from 1.4 -> 1.9.  Not
   responsive to fluid boluses last PM.  UOP has decreased to 35 cc/hr.
   FeNa ~ 10 and UNa is 124, suggestive of ATN possibly secondary to
   sepsis.   Unlikely to respond to further fluids given likely ATN.
   -Would follow Is and Os today
   -Avoid nephrotoxins, hypoperfusion
   -If still not making urine by end of day, consider renal input.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling
   from 7-> 2.0.  Source: peritoneal and blood cultures positive for
   Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Urine Cx negative.  On ceftriaxone, day 5 of
   abx.  Will need to complete 2 wk course after first negative blood
   culture.
   -Continue abx as above
   -f/u cxs
   -hold BP meds
   .
   #Altered mental status: Diff dx is hepatic encephalopathy versus
   delirium from underlying infection vs vascular event.
   - Give lactulose for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue abx as above
   - F/u cxs
   .
   #Hypernatremia
   -Continue free water flushes 250q4
   -Continue 75 ccs D5W/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drifting down from 29 -> 26. Differential is GI source
   (has portal gastropathy on prior EGD) versus DIC  (although less likely
   given absence of schistos), INR increasing.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guiaic all stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient has been intubated due to increasing respiratory distress and had a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) that was non-bloody but positive for proteinaceous material. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone), and the coverage will be expanded to include pseudomonas and atypicals. 

The patient also has extremity edema, and the lasix drip has been stopped as the urine output (UOP) seems to have dropped off and creatinine (Cr) has risen from 1.4 to 1.9. The patient is oliguric, and further management of pulmonary edema is needed. The patient's renal function is worsening, with a rise in Cr from 1.4 to 1.9, and the FeNa is 10, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) possibly secondary to sepsis. 

The patient's sepsis is improving, off pressors, afebrile, with lactates falling from 7 to 2.0. Source control has been achieved with the removal of an infected source.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, oliguria, renal failure, sepsis, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, and coagulopathy. The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, albumin for volume resuscitation, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and continuing liver recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may lead to further respiratory distress or complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Oliguria and renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and rising creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. This could progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
3. Sepsis: The patient's known spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia with Klebsiella Pneumoniae suggest an ongoing infection. If not treated effectively, it could result in septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion may be due to hepatic encephalopathy or delirium caused by underlying"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. He has been complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and sepsis from multiple possible sources. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, oliguria and renal failure, sepsis, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, coagulopathy, and ESLD. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system as a result of ESLD and sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been initiated, but further monitoring and adjustments may be necessary based on culture results.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment with lactulose is recommended to manage this condition.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has shown signs of oliguria and renal failure, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent the progression of AKI.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), suggesting a risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation factors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.
- The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxia, oliguria and renal failure, sepsis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, anemia, coagulopathy, and ESLD.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 107/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and renal function parameters.
- Imaging studies reveal improvement in right lung airspace disease.
- The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, hypotension, and altered mental status.
- The patient's treatment plan includes continuing ceftriaxone, albumin for volume resuscitation, avoiding fluids, monitoring urine output, and avoiding nephrotoxins.
- Additional assessments and plans include suspected pulmonary infection, peripheral eosinophilia, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, coagulopathy, and ESLD.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient's current medical complications include hypernatremia, dyspnea, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), and hypotension (not in shock).

The patient's lab results show elevated sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. The plan is to continue free water flushes and D5W infusion to correct this.

The patient also has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit level. The source of anemia could be portal gastropathy, as indicated by the elevated international normalized ratio (INR). The plan includes monitoring hemoglobin levels, continuing PPI therapy, and transfusing for Hct <21 or further precipitous drop.

The patient has coagulopathy, which is stable. Daily coagulation tests will be performed.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including sepsis, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 105/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of sodium, potassium, and liver enzymes. The white blood cell count is within normal range, but there is a slight increase in eosinophils. The platelet count is low. Renal function tests indicate renal failure.

Imaging shows opacity in the left lower lobe of the lungs, which could be due to infection or pulmonary edema. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for blood, making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage less likely.

The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications including hypernatremia, dyspnea, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, renal failure, and hypotension. They have initiated appropriate treatments such as broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuresis, fluid resuscitation"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and subsequently transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient's current conditions include hypernatremia, dyspnea, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, renal failure, and hypotension. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including sepsis caused by multiple possible sources, acute renal failure, hypoxia, peripheral eosinophilia, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, coagulopathy, and ESLD. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, persistent hypoxia, development of multi-organ dysfunction due to sepsis, progression of hepatic encephalopathy, further decline in coagulation status, and complications related to ESLD. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing ceftriaxone, diuresis based on renal function, monitoring urine output, avoiding nephrotoxins and hypoperfusion, completing a two-week course of antibiotics after the first negative blood culture, monitoring for helminth infection and other infectious causes of pulmonary disease related to eosinophilia, administering lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and managing hypernatremia, anemia, coagulopathy, and ESLD accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for variceal bleeding and managed in the MICU for sepsis. The patient has respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. There are signs of possible renal failure and hypernatremia. Imaging shows improvement in pulmonary infiltrates. The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and lactulose. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of pulmonary eosinophilia and potential drug-related reactions. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation support. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been transferred to the MICU for management of sepsis. Infection control measures should be in place to prevent nosocomial infections. Monitoring for signs of septic shock is crucial.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. Continued monitoring of neurologic status and management with lactulose is essential.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by oliguria and elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and serum electrolytes is necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, dyspnea, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 120/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and albumin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening infection or organ dysfunction.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. It is crucial to monitor the patient's urine output, avoid nephrotoxic medications, and ensure adequate fluid resuscitation while avoiding fluid overload.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is"

   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.  Now stabilized
   and off of sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging
   mental status.
   #Altered mental status: Off of sedation over the weekend with little
   improvement in mental status.  Our diff dx is persistent sedation due
   to residual medications in the setting of liver failure vs hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Delirium due to underlying infection now seems less
   likely.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications.
   - Give lactulose and rifaximin for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue abx as above
   #Hypoxia
 Now on pressure support with minimal vent settings, much
   improved from previously requiring assist control.  While he has
   adequate respiratory effort to be extubated, he remains too sedated to
   have a gag reflex.  The patient
s CT showed interlobar thickening and
   airspace disease of unclear significance.  Main Ddx is infection vs
   pulmonary edema.  His CXR is improved but has residual, diffuse
   perenchymal disease.
   - Continue ceftriaxone- Day [**7-16**]  (Day 1= [**9-20**]  - day of first
   negative culture)
   - Diuresis per renal function
   # ESLD: Patient has end stage disease with significant ascites,
   coagulopathy and bilirubinemia.
   - Follow liver recs
   - He will have a paracentesis today for increasing abdominal
   distension.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin but hold spironolactone, lasix,
   nadolol

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. 
- The patient is now stabilized and off sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging mental status.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, dyspnea, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure, and hypotension.
- The patient's CT scan showed interlobar thickening and airspace disease of unclear significance. The main differential diagnosis is infection versus pulmonary edema. 
- The patient's CXR is improved but has residual, diffuse perenchymal disease.
- The patient has end-stage liver disease with significant ascites, coagulopathy, and bilirubinemia.
- The patient's oliguria and renal failure are being managed with diuretics.
- The patient had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia with Klebsiella Pneumoniae. 
- The patient's peripheral eosinophilia is being investigated for possible causes such as helminth infection or drug reaction.

   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.  Now stabilized
   and off of sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging
   mental status.
   #Altered mental status: Off of sedation over the weekend with little
   improvement in mental status.  Differential: persistent sedation due to
   residual medications in the setting of liver failure vs hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Delirium due to underlying infection now seems less
   likely.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications.
   - Give lactulose and rifaximin for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue abx as above
   #Hypoxia
 Now on pressure support with minimal vent settings, much
   improved from previously requiring assist control.  While he has
   adequate respiratory effort to be extubated, he remains too sedated to
   have a gag reflex.  CT showed interlobar thickening and airspace
   disease of unclear significance.  Main Ddx is infection vs pulmonary
   edema.  His CXR is improved but has residual, diffuse perenchymal
   disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. He is now stabilized and off sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging mental status.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and potential complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient remains sedated and has not shown significant improvement in mental status despite being off sedation. The differential includes persistent sedation due to residual medications in the setting of liver failure versus hepatic encephalopathy. Delirium due to underlying infection seems less likely.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is now on pressure support with minimal vent settings, much improved from previously requiring assist control. He remains too sedated to have a gag reflex.

   57 yo M with h/o of alcoholic ESLD, admitted for evaluation of variceal
   bleed, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred
   to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources.  Now stabilized
   and off of sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging
   mental status.
   #Altered mental status: Off of sedation over the weekend with little
   improvement in mental status.  Differential: persistent sedation due to
   residual medications in the setting of liver failure vs hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Delirium due to underlying infection now seems less
   likely.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications.
   - Give lactulose and rifaximin for HE, if unable to take PO, give PR
   - Continue abx as above
   #Hypoxia
 Now on pressure support with minimal vent settings, much
   improved from previously requiring assist control.  While he has
   adequate respiratory effort to be extubated, he remains too sedated to
   have a gag reflex.  CT showed interlobar thickening and airspace
   disease of unclear significance.  Main Ddx is infection vs pulmonary
   edema.  His CXR is improved but has residual, diffuse perenchymal
   disease.
   - Continue ceftriaxone- Day [**7-16**]  (Day 1= [**9-20**]  - day of first
   negative culture)
   - Diuresis per renal function

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD), admitted for evaluation of variceal bleeding, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient is now stabilized and off sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has not improved much despite being off sedation. Differential causes include persistent sedation due to residual medications in the setting of liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and delirium due to underlying infection. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to identify the cause and provide appropriate management.

2. Hypoxia: The patient now requires pressure support with minimal vent settings and has shown improvement from previously requiring assist control. There is a concern for infection versus pulmonary edema. The CT scan shows interlobar thickening and airspace disease of unclear significance. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and management should be based on the results.

3. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease with significant ascites, coagulopathy, and bilirubinemia. Negative paracentesis suggests no active infection in the ascitic fluid. Ursodiol has been increased. Ongoing monitoring and management of liver function, along with following up on liver recommendations, are crucial.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted for evaluation of variceal bleed. He was later transferred to the MICU for sepsis from multiple possible sources. The patient has been stabilized and is now off sedation with improving respiratory status but lagging mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is still impaired despite being off sedation. This could be due to residual medications in the setting of liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has shown improvement in respiratory status but still requires minimal ventilator settings. There is interlobar thickening and airspace disease on CT, indicating possible infection or pulmonary edema.

3. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease with significant ascites, coagulopathy, and bilirubinemia. Negative paracentesis indicates no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have normalized, and urine output is good. However, there is a concern for renal failure, and Lasix gtt is being continued.
