","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and a positive family history for heart disease. He presented with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed occlusion in the mid-LAD artery. Post-cath echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has risk factors for ACS, including a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a significant smoking history. He presented with NSTEMI and had an unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch during cardiac catheterization. 
2. Prostatitis: The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently taking bactrim and flomax. He was unable to void after the cardiac catheterization, requiring Foley catheter placement with greater than 1L urine output.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's post-cath creatinine level is elevated from 1.0 to 1.3. He received intravenous contrast with computed tomography angiography (CTA) at the outside hospital and with cardiac catheterization. Cardiac index is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and smoking, who presented to the ICU with an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, but the PTCA was unsuccessful due to occlusion. Post-cath echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient also has a history of prostatitis and is currently on bactrim and flomax. He received IV contrast during the CTA at OSH and cardiac catheterization, leading to acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3 (baseline 1.0). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's risk factors for ACS include hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and smoking history. The unsuccessful PTCA of the diagonal branch of LAD further increases the risk of complications related to coronary artery disease.
2. Reduced Ejection Fraction (EF): The post-cath echocardiogram showed an EF of 30%, indicating moderately-to-severely depressed LV systolic function. This increases the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and smoking, admitted to the ICU for NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Post-cath echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient is currently receiving integrilin, Plavix, heparin, beta-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor. Further management includes cardiac rehabilitation, monitoring urine output, and avoiding fluids and further diuresis due to pulmonary hypertension and elevated wedge pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has risk factors including a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a significant smoking history. The unsuccessful PTCA of the diagonal branch of LAD increases the risk of further ischemic events.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The post-cath creatinine level of 1.3 indicates a potential decline in renal function. The patient received IV contrast with CTA at OSH and cardiac cath, which can contribute to acute renal failure.
3. Prostatitis: The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently taking bactrim and"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's low ejection fraction and previous myocardial infarction increase the risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen due to ongoing ischemia, contrast-induced nephropathy, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and smoking, who was admitted to the ICU for an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD), but the PTCA was unsuccessful. Post-cath echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient is currently on multiple medications including integrilin, Plavix, heparin, metoprolol, lisinopril, lipitor, and Bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient already experienced an NSTEMI and had a blocked LAD artery. There is a risk of further ischemic events if not properly managed.
2. Heart Failure: With an LVEF of 30%, the patient has reduced systolic function, which puts him at risk for acute systolic congestive heart failure. Monitoring I/Os and using t/c lasix for diuresis if needed are important to manage this condition.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   48 yr old white male with occluded LAD with significant thrombus which
   was treated with thrombectomy and [**Year (4 digits) **].  Peak CK 4800.   EKG with ASMI
   with some STE but no gross change compared with post PCI EKG.  Echo
   reviewed.
   Physical Examination
   No rub or murmur.
   Groin intact.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will slowly advance beta blocker.
   Continue integrilin for 48 hrs.
   With large AMI and apical akinesis, will continue heparin and
   transition to coumadin.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

   on:[**2175-4-1**] 11:42 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a 30 pack-year smoking history. He was admitted to the ICU with NSTEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization, where an occlusion in the mid-LAD was identified. Unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal was performed. Post-cath echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has risk factors for ACS, including hyperlipidemia, borderline DM, positive family history, and smoking. He underwent cardiac catheterization with unsuccessful PTCA and has reduced EF with regional wall motion abnormalities.
2. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's LVEF is now 30% following MI with new wall motion abnormalities. He is euvolemic and oxygenating well on RA (room air).
3. Prostatitis: The patient has a history of prostatitis and was unable to void post-cath, requiring Foley catheter with greater than 1L urine output. He is able to void without problem overnight.
4. Acute Renal Failure"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a 30-pack-year smoking history.
- He was transferred from the other hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the mid-LAD for occlusion.
- The patient also had an unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch.
- Post-catheterization, an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall.
- The patient's peak creatine kinase (CPK) level was 4861, and his blood pressure is low, ranging from 80-90 mmHg.
- The patient's heart rate is at goal in the range of 50-60 beats per minute.
- The plan includes continuing integrilin infusion for a total of 48 hours, discontinuing heparin this morning, continuing Plavix and aspirin for at least one year, initiating warfarin for apical akinesis, decreasing metoprolol dose, starting an ACE inhibitor if blood pressure tolerates, continuing lipitor 80mg daily, and consulting physical therapy for cardiac rehabilitation at discharge.
- The patient is also diagnosed with acute systolic congestive heart failure with a new wall motion abnormality (WMA), currently euvolemic and oxygenating well on room air.
- Monitoring intake and output (I/Os) is recommended, and titrating lasix for diuresis if the patient develops shortness of breath or evidence of volume overload.
- The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently on Bactrim and flomax.
- He was unable to void post-catheterization, requiring a Foley catheter with greater than 1L urine output.
- Continuing flomax and bactrim is advised.
- The patient has a fever overnight with a maximum temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, which is likely related to Foley placement in a patient with chronic prostatitis.
- Trending the fever curve, following up with a urine culture, and continuing bactrim are recommended.
- The patient has acute renal failure post catheterization with a creatinine level of 1.3 (baseline 1.0).
- The patient received intravenous contrast with computed tomography angiography (CTA) at the other hospital and during cardiac catheterization.
- Avoiding fluids for now due to pulmonary hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, avoiding further lasix, and avoiding nephrotoxic medications while renally dosing as indicated are advised.
- The patient also has borderline diabetes with mildly elevated blood sugars and a hemoglobin A1c level of 5.8.
- The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and should continue with an H2 blocker.
- The patient is on a heart-healthy diet and needs repletion of electrolytes as needed.
- The patient is currently on heparin, bowel regimen as needed, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- The patient has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other relevant comments."

   physical examination shows borderline BPs on Metoprolol but a clear
   lung examination.   His LVEF is moderately depressed (LVEF = 30%) by
   echocardiography.  We have initiated aspirin, clopidogrel, beta
   blockers, coumadin, and statin therapy and begun a trial of ACE
   inhibitors (as limited by hypotension).  He seems very motivated for
   ongoing risk factor modification and I would be happy to follow him in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and a positive family history of heart disease. He presented with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed occlusion in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery and unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch. Post-catheterization echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome - The patient has risk factors for ACS, including a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a significant smoking history. He underwent cardiac catheterization with unsuccessful PTCA, indicating ongoing ischemia.
2. Heart Failure - The patient's EF is moderately depressed at 30%, and there is evidence of systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum. This increases the risk of acute systolic congestive heart failure.
3. Prostatitis - The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently on Bact"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and a recent myocardial infarction (MI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but had unsuccessful PTCA of the diagonal branch. Post-cath echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient's peak CPK level was 4861, and his heart rate is at goal in the 50-60 range, although his systolic blood pressure (SBP) is low in the 80-90 range.

The patient has been started on several medications including Plavix, H2 blocker, atorvastatin, metoprolol, ranitidine, tamsulosin, Bactrim, and coumadin. The goal is to reduce ischemia, anti-platelet therapy, and anti-coagulation. The patient's urine output has been good with no signs of volume overload or distress. His respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen, but no mechanical ventilation is required.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as mildly elevated liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a significant smoking history. He was admitted for NSTEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed occlusion in the mid-LAD. Post-cath, the patient experienced acute systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient also has a history of prostatitis and acute renal failure due to IV contrast administration during cardiac catheterization. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has risk factors for ACS, including hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and smoking history. The recent occlusion in the mid-LAD during cardiac catheterization indicates ongoing ischemia, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
2. Antiplatelet Therapy: The patient is already on Plavix and Integrilin for antiplatelet therapy. However, there is a potential complication of bleeding due to the use of these medications.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient is prescribed Coumadin for apical akinesis. Monitoring of INR levels is crucial to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: With an ejection fraction of 30%, the patient is at risk for worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid overload. Monitoring I/Os and administering lasix for diuresis"

However, there was unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch. The post-cath ECHO showed reduced EF and regional wall motion abnormalities, indicating ongoing ischemia.
2. Acute Renal Failure - The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0, which has increased to 1.3 and now 1.5. This rise in creatinine is concerning for acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy from the IV contrast used during the cardiac catheterization and CTA.
3. Prostatitis - The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently taking bactrim and flomax. He developed urinary retention post-cath, requiring Foley catheter placement. The presence of dysuria and mild fever raises concern for a urinary tract infection (UTI) related to the Foley catheter.
4. Gout Flare - The patient is experiencing an active gout flare, particularly affecting his right knee, right toe, and left ankle. He reports that this is similar to previous gout flares. The involvement of the left knee with a large effusion but without tenderness or erythema is also noted.
5. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure - The patient's LVEF has decreased to 30% post-MI, indicating reduced cardiac function. He is now presenting with new wall motion abnormalities consistent with acute systolic CHF. The patient is euvolemic and saturating well on room air.
6. Borderline Diabetes - The patient reports being told by his primary care physician that he has borderline blood sugars. His fasting blood sugar is 105, and his HbA1c is within normal limits at 5.8.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information or testing may be required to fully assess the patient's condition and potential complications."

He was admitted for NSTEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the mid-LAD for occlusion. Post-cath ECHO showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient's peak CPK level was 4861.

The patient's current medical issues include acute coronary syndrome, acute systolic congestive heart failure, prostatitis, fever, acute renal failure, hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, GERD, gout, and food eaten normally.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3F, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 87/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion, colchicine, Tylenol #3 for pain relief, and other ICU medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, and a positive family history for cardiovascular disease. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. A mid-LAD occlusion was found, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the diagonal branch was attempted but unsuccessful. Post-cath echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and anterior free wall. The patient's peak creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was 4861.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has risk factors for ACS, including hyperlipidemia, borderline diabetes, positive family history, and a significant smoking history. Treatment goals include reducing ischemia, anti-platelet therapy, and anticoagulation.
2. Prostatitis: The patient has a history of prostatitis and is currently taking bactrim and flomax. He developed urinary retention post-cath and required Foley catheter placement with greater than 1L urine output.
3. Fever: The patient experienced a mild fever overnight, which may be related to Foley placement in a patient with chronic prostatitis. Urinalysis is negative"
