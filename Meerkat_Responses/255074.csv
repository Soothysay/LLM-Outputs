","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia requiring CPAP, likely secondary to congestive heart failure. The patient has resistant hypertension, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and acute pulmonary edema.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) due to non-adherence to diet and diastolic dysfunction. Diuretic therapy has helped improve oxygenation.
2. CHF: The patient has acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. She will benefit from afterload reduction and diuresis therapy.
3. Resistant Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. Her goal blood pressure is 120-140 mmHg.
4. Agitation: The patient is agitated on the BiPAP machine. She previously received Ativan 0.5 mg daily at home.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were elevated during her last admission, and currently it is 3.3 mg/dL, likely due to poor forward flow. Diuretic therapy will be monitored, and urine output will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), right subclavian stenosis, and recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. The patient presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to congestive heart failure due to non-adherence to diet and diastolic dysfunction. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 162/81 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP support. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, and increased creatinine level. The electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm with no acute changes. 

The patient's current medications include nitro drip for blood pressure control and diuresis, lasix for diuresis, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam for agitation, and other medications for hypertension management. 

The patient's plan includes optimizing medical management of diastolic CHF, monitoring for autodiuresis, maintaining strict intake and output measurements, daily weights, and afterload reduction with hydralazine and nitro gtt.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, fluid overload state, hypertension, progressive renal failure, and agitation. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxia, congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and agitation. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including CPAP for respiratory support, diuretics for fluid overload, and antihypertensive medications. The patient's renal function has worsened, and there is a concern for resistant effusions and the need for dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have desaturations requiring CPAP. Etiology is a combination of CHF and impaired renal function resulting in fluid overload state.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's pressures are generally less than 130/90 unless agitated. She is managed with maxed out Isosorbide, hydralazine, ISMN, clonidine patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, and hydralazine. Complications include maintaining strict intake and output (I&Os), daily weights, and a low sodium diet.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine has been elevated during the last admission, currently at 4"

   ED w/ SOB, in fluid overload state with hypertension, progressive renal
   failure (rising Cr) and continued agitation
   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.
   - Today's ekg shows normal qt, will check again tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, fluid overload state, hypertension, progressive renal failure, and continued agitation. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and agitation. She is also being considered for dialysis due to fluid overload and failing renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have desaturations requiring CPAP. This could be due to the combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and impaired renal function resulting in a fluid overload state. The etiology of the hypoxia is multifactorial, and the patient may require elective endotracheal intubation for improved ventilation and sedation for MRA.

2. CHF: The patient's pressures are generally below 130/90 unless agitated. She is being managed with a maximum dose of Isosorbide, hydralazine, ISMN, clonidine patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, and hydralazine. Supportive care, strict intake and output (I&Os), and consideration of adding lobetalol instead of metoprolol should be continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a stroke. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to acute-on-chronic renal failure and fluid overload state.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for sedation during an MRA and for tiring on CPAP. The hypoxia is likely due to a combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and impaired renal function resulting in fluid overload.

2. CHF: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which is being managed with rate control and afterload reduction. Medications such as clonidine patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, Isosorbide, and hydralazine are being used to optimize heart function. The patient also has a moderate right pleural effusion.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient is now anuric with a creatinine level of 4.4. This is likely due to pre-renal azotemia caused by IVF depletion and the administration of Lasix. The patient may require hemodialysis for fluid overload and renal failure.

4. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing excessive beta-blockade, sed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke presenting with acute diastolic heart failure, oliguria/anuria, pulmonary edema, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is a result of chronic heart failure and impaired renal function leading to fluid overload. This condition can worsen without proper management.

2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's diastolic heart failure may lead to further exacerbation of congestive heart failure symptoms, including shortness of breath, fluid retention, and increased cardiac workload.

3. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. If left untreated, it can progress to end-stage renal disease and require dialysis.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral parenchymal opacities on imaging may suggest the presence of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be considered based on the preliminary sputum gram stain and respiratory culture results.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest due to intubation increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, should be"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke and presented with shortness of breath. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute oliguria/anuria, pain control, heart failure (diastolic), altered mental status, and pulmonary edema. 

The assessment and plan include optimizing rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure, considering therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions, considering dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal function, managing chronic pain, managing acute pain, and managing altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening heart failure, further decline in renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and use of prophylactic heparin, and potential complications from long-term use of medications such as clonidine, amlodipine, metoprolol, and lasix.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Frequent assessments of urine output and electrolyte levels should be performed. The patient's pain should be managed appropriately, and efforts should be made to improve her mental status through"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke. The patient presented with acute respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and hypoxic respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and optimization of oxygen delivery are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Fluid overload state with falling renal function: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine from baseline. Close monitoring of fluid balance and consideration of dialysis may be required to manage fluid overload and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure (CHF) and impaired renal function suggest the possibility of diastolic heart failure. Rate control and afterload reduction strategies should be continued to optimize cardiac output and manage fluid retention.

4. Resistant effusions: The patient has resistant pleural effusions, and therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis may be considered to manage these effusions.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has had episodes of bradycardia, which could be due to excessive beta-blockade with medications or"

He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and noted to be in a fluid overload state in the setting of CKD and worsening renal function. The patient was intubated for respiratory support in the setting of frequent desats with CPAP.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced autodiuresis of 1.5L without lasix in the setting of stable Cr of 4.7 from baseline in high 2, low 3. He also had standing haldol 0.5 mg for agitation in an attempt to wean from fentanyl and midazolam, with PRN doses recommended by psychiatry with ECG monitoring for QT interval.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 167/48mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination revealed no wheezing or rales in the lungs, regular rate and rhythm with a left parasternal systolic murmur, non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and well-perfused extremities with trace edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload state in the setting of CKD and worsening renal function. The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desats with CPAP. He has a history of recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently experiencing shortness of breath.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient's current marginal respiratory status on CPAP and need for intubation indicate the possibility of hypoxic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation levels are necessary.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload state in the setting of CKD. Close monitoring of fluid balance, daily weights, and strict input/output measurements should be maintained to prevent further fluid accumulation.
3. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's presentation suggests CHF, as evidenced by his known diastolic heart failure and current symptoms of dyspnea. Afterload reduction, strict I/O management, and dietary modifications should be implemented to manage this condition.
4. Resistant Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension with labile pressures ranging from 120 to 180 systolic. Afterload reduction and adjustment of antihyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload state, and subsequently intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. The patient has been experiencing autodiuresis without Lasix in the setting of stable creatinine levels. He is also experiencing agitation, which has been managed with Haldol IV PRN with ECG monitoring. Other medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. The patient's renal function has worsened, and he has been autodiuretic with stable creatinine levels. Long-term hemodialysis is being considered for fluid control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated for marginal respiratory status on CPAP. There is a potential complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's known diastolic heart failure is being treated with afterload reduction for fluid overload state. There is a potential complication of worsening cardiac function or cardiogenic shock.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is low, indicating anemia. There is a potential complication of further blood loss or development of severe anemia requiring transfusion.

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient currently intubated for
   marginal respiratory status on CPAP and for MRA to r/o RAS
 negative.
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   -try psv today, plan for extubation tomorrow
   - could also consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for
   resistant effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will continue
   fent and midaz boluses but change to q2h.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise
   -greatly appreciate renal recs
   -pt seems to be autodiuresing this am, will hold off on more lasix but
   plan for TBB of -1Liter, use lasix boluses prn (120IV)
   .
   ## Bradycardia: DDx excessive beta blockade with meds vs. sedation vs.
   increased ICP (note patient has HTN and old strokes)
   -CT head without contrast to evaluate for ICH reassuring
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   -will restart bblocker as no bradycardia since yesterday morning

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and was found to be in a fluid overload state due to CKD and worsening renal function. The patient required intubation for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations while on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for marginal respiratory status on CPAP and for mechanical ventilation to rule out right-sided heart failure (MRA). He continues to receive optimized rate control and afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure, and plans for extubation tomorrow are mentioned.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient was managed with clonidine patch, amlodipine, metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine, to control heart rate and afterload reduction. Supportive care is being provided, including strict intake/output monitoring, maintaining systolic blood pressure between 150-160 mmHg, and daily weights. A low sodium diet is also recommended.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension with labile pressures ranging from 120-180 systolic. Medications include clon"

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.    Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.   Respiratory status stable on face mask and nasal cannula.
   CXR shows pulm edema.
   Holding diuresis given renal failure.
   - repeat CXR
   - optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion
   - cardiology consulted
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion shows some improvement as
   evidenced by improvement in renal function.    She has history of MR,
   which is evident on exam and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does
   not support this), and may be a contributing factor to her worsening
   pulmonary edema.
   - Pt has isolated systolic hypertension, which is improving, but
   medically optimizing hypertension and cardiac output could benefit her
   renal function and prolong hemodialysis
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ## Anemia: HCT continues to [**2125**]6.5
 25.2
 23.8 in the setting of
   falling all cell lines (WBC
s and platelets). Today Hct is 24.3,
   stable.
   - NG aspirate guaic negative
   - no BM
 guaic stool, bowel regimen to facilitate this test.
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT this evening
   - IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   - d/c fentanyl, should be used for agitation.
   - may  need to uptitrate haldol with discontinuation of fentanyl
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP
   of 1200cc.   Anticipate renal function should continue to improve with
   improved renal perfusion.   MRA performed confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of  improving
   - hold Lasix for now
   - consider long term HD for ultimate fluid control

The patient presented with acute onset dyspnea and was found to be in fluid overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desats with CPAP.

During the 24-hour period, the following events occurred:
- EKG was performed at [**2126-8-19**] 08:24 AM.
- Non-invasive ventilation was stopped at [**2126-8-19**] 03:30 PM.
- Sputum culture was taken at [**2126-8-19**] 04:13 PM.
- The patient was extubated with a post-extubation arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.34, PaCO2 53 mmHg, PaO2 122 mmHg, and HCO3- 30 mEq/L.
- Renal recommendations included starting a phosphate binder when the patient is no longer NPO and starting aldactone 25 mg if potassium remains lower end of normal. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8048**] will return tomorrow for HD discussion.

   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.   Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.  Respiratory status stable on
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion as evidenced by improvement in
   renal function.
   - re-adjust BP medications, titrate to improve afterload reduction
   potentially add lobetalol, and hydralazine
   - maintain strict I/O

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and noted to be in fluid overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. The patient required intubation for respiratory support due to frequent desaturation events while on CPAP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (with a range of 63-88 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 140/36 mmHg to 184/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a range of 12-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been extubated and is now on room air with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. Her ventilation parameters show a spontaneous tidal volume of 360 mL (with a range of 360-450 mL), peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 244.

The patient's physical examination reveals no"

   24 Hour Events:
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and
   w/ continued clonidine patch
   -cardiology recs:  treat BP with imdur 60 [**Hospital1 **], hydral 10 mg q6 hrs, can
   continue amlodipine, and can uptitrate labetolol to get HR 50s-60s.
   Will also probably benefit from lasix long term.  Suggest trying to

   dose of lopressor; labetolol was uptitrated to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> TID.
   Returned to sinus rhythm within ~1 hr of flipping into afib with HRs
   back in the 80s. Throughout night had multiple reversions to afib with
   HRs in 130s-140s: esmolol drip started with bolus of 250 mcg/kg then
   running at 150 mcg/kg/min given persistence of tachycardia; HRs
   improved to 60s-70s, BP in the 150s, satting in mid 80s.  ABG at 5 AM

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).  Currently on labetalol 100
   TID and on esmolol drip running at 150 mcg/hr with HRs back in sinus
   and BPs in the 150s systolic.
   -Obtain 2D echo to evaluate for worsening of systolic function; per
   echo in early [**2126-7-23**], had mild LVH, normal systolic function, no
   valvular disease
   -Optimize BP control with labetalol + can add Imdur 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] per cards
   recs
   -Rate control with labetalol and esmolol
   -Per CHADS2: she scores 4:  should be started on coumadin.  INR is
   currently 1.3.    Currently in sinus but if reverts back to atrial
   fibrillation, consider starting anticoagulation.
   .
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.  CXR shows florid pulm edema. Received lasix
   120 mg IV X 1 yesterday with diuresis of ~.8 L.   Creatinine improved
   from 4.1 to 3.9.   Got another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat
   creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - not diuresing much with lasix boluses; consider adding metolazone to
   lasix;  slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might
   be room for further diuresis
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving end organ
   perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement in renal
   function.    She has history of MR, which is evident on exam and prior
   ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and may be a
   contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Given that could be secondary to MR, need to continue afterload
   reduction.  On amlodipine, hydral only being given if SBP > 180, also
   on labetalol and esmolol drip.   Further diuresis with lasix +
   metolazone may prove useful.  Can put on standing hydralazine.  Should
   repeat echo to evaluate mitral valve function.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  EKG being repeated this AM to look for QT
   prolongation.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - ECHO - shows mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg
   - slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might be
   room for further diuresis
   - optimize volume status with slower diuresis, goal
 500cc /day
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replaceme.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, addition of metoprolol 25mg tid,
   titrating esmolol down as HR has normalized.
   - start heparin w/o bolus for anticoagulation, will discuss with family
   regarding long term anticoagulation
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   -  Discontinue amlodipine,
   - Continue labetolol, lasix, started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol
   25tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increase hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   - f/u retic count
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.

   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with shortness of breath in the setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib), acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), oliguria/anuria, pain control (acute and chronic pain), heart failure (diastolic), acute altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema due to chronic MR, exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has new-onset paroxysmal AFib with unclear etiology. It could be triggered by hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/worsening valvular dysfunction.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline creatinine levels range from 2.2-2.9 during his last admission. His current creatinine level is 4.0. Further improvement in renal function may be achieved with continued diuresis.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has improved from 4.7 to about 4."

- Imaging studies reveal a large pleural effusion on the right side and evidence of pulmonary edema, which has improved from the previous day's chest X-ray (CXR).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) ranging from 66 to 121 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 99 to 178 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18-38 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and temperature (T) ranging from 35.9 to 36.3 degrees Celsius.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary edema and fluid overload may lead to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is exacerbated by her chronic mitral regurgitation and high afterload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a new onset of paroxysmal AF, possibly triggered by hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, or worsening valvular dysfunction.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to prolonged renal ischemia or pre-renal azotemia.
4. Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has a history of MR, which can contribute to her worsening pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
5. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain management for acute and chronic pain.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels are stable, but further evaluation of her reticulocyte count is needed.
7. Agitation: The patient is agitated, and sedation with haloperidol (Haldol) has been initiated to manage agitation and avoid the use of benzodiazepines.
8. Goals of Care: The patient's son does not want to pursue long-term ventilation without"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -Given difficult to control, consider cardioversion, talk w/ cards,
   although getting outside of window of opportunity to cardiovert w/o
   anticoagulation
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].

   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -f/u cards recs, look back to see if hx of afib, ablation candidate?
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident. The patient presented with shortness of breath in the setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function. Mitral regurgitation has limited treatment options outside of repair or replacement. The patient's recent chest X-ray shows improving pulmonary edema.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing hydralazine and labetalol to reduce afterload, as well as metoprolol and isosorbide. The esmolol drip is being titrated down. The goal is to maintain a daily fluid intake of 500 cc.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with an unclear etiology, likely related to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/worsening valvular dysfunction. Electrolytes have been within normal limits, and the patient is currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID and metoprolol increased to 75 mg TID. The esmolol drip is being titrated down as the heart rate normalizes.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note include congestive heart failure with mitral regurgitation, resistant hypertension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic mitral regurgitation, and acute on chronic renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation. This is likely due to pulmonary edema, possibly caused by chronic mitral regurgitation and fluid overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may be triggered by hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, or worsening valvular dysfunction.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, potentially due to acute tubular necrosis from prolonged renal ischemia. Optimization of diuresis regimen is necessary to improve renal perfusion.
4. Chronic Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has a history of chronic mitral regurgitation, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Yesterday D/C
d labetalol, esmolol drip. Pressures this AM
   are 170/70; needs much improved systolic control.  Can push up
   hydralazine (currently on 25 q8) -> can go to 50 mg q8.  Reducing
   afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and improving
   her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.  Could
   consider switching from metoprolol to labetalol, since labetalol will
   provide better BP control.   Further diuresis only important for
   afterload reduction rather than taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily
   without any lasix, so would not aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 50 mg q8
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   - Currently on metoprolol 100 mg, can consider switch to labetalol at
   higher dose (max dose of labetalol is 1600 mg/day!); continue
   amiodarone to maintain sinus.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; check afternoon HCT, especially since
   started on heparin IV yesterday.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving
   any fluids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient presents with shortness of breath, fluid overload, and worsening renal function. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function. The patient's mitral regurgitation has limited treatment options outside of repair or replacement. A chest X-ray from yesterday shows improving pulmonary edema. The patient's net fluid balance is negative 0.5 liters, and her creatinine level remains stable at 3.9.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, which is likely secondary to chronic mitral regurgitation exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level during her last admission was 2.2-2.9, and it has improved from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis. Further improvement can be achieved with continued diuresis and afterload reduction.
3. Agitation: The patient is agitated, and psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. The patient has wrist restraints"

   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain except at IV site when potassium given.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 PULMONARY EDEMA:  As above.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr staying around 4.0. Repeat urine
   lytes.  Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as
   above.
 ANEMA:  Hct slightly decreased, will check pm hct given she has been
   started on heparin. Guaiac all stools.

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. He was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) due to fluid overload and worsening renal function.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate ranging from 55 to 119 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/45 mmHg to 201/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels. Other lab results indicate imbalances in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.

The patient's medical conditions include anxiety, atrial fibrillation (AFib), respiratory failure (acute), oliguria/anuria, pain control (acute and chronic), heart failure (diastolic), altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and hypertension (resistant).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's SOB and low oxygen saturation indicate the possibility of respiratory failure,"

 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 PULMONARY EDEMA
   Assessment/Plan:
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2123**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2126-8-24**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   .
   (#) Hypoxia: improving; patient already down to 6LNC in the ICU.
   Evidence of volume overload on CXR.  Patient also had emesis and,
   though he is not at especially high risk, may have had an aspiration
   event.  He has not gotten an extra large amount of volume aside from
   the 4 units total of FFP.  He has now received lasix 20, then 40 mg IV
   though is urine output is only 20 cc over the last three to four
   hours.  (Of note, he did have 300 cc urine recorded in flow sheet at 11
   pm last night.)  Despite to putting out urine, the patient does report
   feeling better.  Low suspicion for PE or other pathology.
   -- cont to wean oxygen and diurese as tolerated
   -- aspiration precautions if he continues to vomit
   -- antiemetics PRN
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context
   of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.  Has been nauseaus since
   admission likely from RP bleed.  Pt has no h/o ETOH abuse, liver
   disease which would be concerning for ascities.  no known ulcer
   disease; denies upper bleed such as epistaxis and dental bleeding.
   - NPO; IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain active T&S
   - Maintain Hct > 25 given large degree of drop from baseline (though
   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2123**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2123**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2123**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2121**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 319**]
   [**2125**].
   -HISS
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 851**] [**Location (un) 684**] of [**Last Name (un) 294**] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for
   kidney disease
   .
   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.
   - furosemide according to BP parameters
   -hold metoprolol and valsartan, reasses if needed
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

2. Possible UGIB: The patient had an episode of guaiac-positive emesis in the context of severe cough and post-tussive emesis. NPO status should be maintained, and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be administered. Active temperature and serial troponin measurements should be maintained.
3. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a broad differential diagnosis for the retroperitoneal bleed, including renal malignancy, pyelonephritis/abscess, vascular disease, or rupture of renal cyst. Uro"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY:  Still think this is a sigificant component of anxiety,
   possible sundowning contributing to decompensations at night.  Consider
   Geriatrics consult to help guide us on this.
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA:  Gently IVF hydration overnight.  Given urine
   electrolytes with Na < 10, this is likely prerenal.  Gentle hydration
   as she still has poor po intake.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus bradycardia.
   Discontinue amiodarone as per cardiology.   Hold on starting diltiazem
   for now. On IV heparin, PTT 104, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT
   this afternoon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 PULMONARY EDEMA: Increased Fi02 requirements in setting of anxiety,
   hypertension.  Likely related to exacerbation of her underlying
   diastolic dysfunction.  CXR not significantly changed.  Had increased
   hydralazine dosing yesterday, continue 75 QID.  Will continue to
   monitor in ICU given labile blood pressures and escalating Fi02
   requirements.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr stable 3.8. Repeat urine lytes.
   Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as above.

 ANEMA:  More than adequate bump to transfusion 1 u pRBCs yesterday.
   Spuriously low.  Guaiac all stools on heparin.  Check daily hct.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing increasing Fi02 requirements, suggesting a worsening respiratory status. This could be due to pulmonary edema caused by significant mitral regurgitation (MR), diastolic dysfunction, and suboptimal afterload reduction.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, indicating possible renal dysfunction. The serum creatinine levels are stable but still elevated, suggesting ongoing renal impairment.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 10.1 g/dL, indicating anemia. A transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has already been administered.

4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output is decreased, which may be related to prerenal causes such as dehydration or hypovolemia.

5. Anxiety and altered mental status: The patient is experiencing anxiety and agitation, which could contribute to decompensation at night. There is also a mention of possible sundowning, which is a phenomenon where patients with dementia or cognitive impairment experience increased agitation in the evening.

6. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): Although the patient currently appears to have sinus bradycardia, there was a previous episode of AFIB. The amiodarone was discontinued per cardiology recommendation, and the heparin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. He was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled hypertension. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress, anxiety, and elevated blood pressure. He was placed on BiPAP overnight due to persistent hypoxia and now has worsening chest X-ray and decreasing urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and worsening renal function may lead to hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Partial collapse of the right lung: The worsening opacity in the right lower and middle lobes on the chest X-ray suggests partial collapse of the right lung.
3. Delirium: The patient's agitation and labile hypertension may contribute to delirium.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient likely developed AFib/RVR as a result of myocardial infarction and decompensated heart failure.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's stable creatinine level with decreased urine output indicates acute on chronic renal failure.
6. Agitation: The patient continues to experience agitation, which may require further management.
7. Goals of care: The patient and his son do not want to pursue long-term ventilation without foreseeable improvement."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. He was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled hypertension. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress associated with anxiety and elevated blood pressure. He has been placed on BiPAP overnight for persistent hypoxia and has worsening chest X-ray and decreasing urine output.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's blood pressure is labile and difficult to control, and he is currently on a combination of antihypertensive medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 168/46 to 235/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on BiPAP. His current laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular pulses assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not assessed. The chest X-ray shows worsening opacities in the right lung fields, consistent with partial collapse and pleural effusion.

The patient's current plan includes continuing anti-h"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. He was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. Despite maximal afterload reduction and fluid management, the patient continues to experience issues with pulmonary edema and requires respiratory support.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, which is likely caused by mitral regurgitation exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and worsening renal function.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely as a result of mitral regurgitation and decompensated heart failure. Amiodarone was initially started but discontinued due to concern for QTc prolongation associated with anti-psychotics.
3. Resistant Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension with very labile pressures ranging from 120 to 240 systolic. The hypertension often worsens with agitation and delirium, but improves with sedation.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute worsening of chronic renal failure, with improving creatinine levels but still insufficient urine output. The patient appears clinically dry and is receiving goal-directed fluid management.
5. Agitation/Delerium: The patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal sleep"

She was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. Despite maximal afterload reduction and fluid management, the patient continues to experience issues with pulmonary edema and requires respiratory support.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 215/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a soft left systolic ejection murmur. Her general condition is comfortable, but she has continued pulmonary edema and delirium.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and stable creatinine levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are abnormal but stable.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypertension. The plan includes continuing current hypertension regimen with PRN hydralazine, BiPAP, deferring additional diuresis, and optimizing heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son
 issue of anticoagulation needs to be
   address
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   - - f/u metanephrines for consideration of pheo
 this seems unlikely
   given normal HR and lack of additional stigmata a/w catecholamine
   excess
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   7L for [**Location 4982**] goal I & O
s are even today
   ##. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - continue to follow Geriatrics recs
   ##. Goals of care
 hopeful family meeting today to discuss GOC with
   son, patient may not fully understand the implications of DNR/DNI.
   Renal is aware and is available to attend.

   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes

   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was admitted with complaints of dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. Despite being maximally afterload reduced and fluid negative, she continues to experience issues with pulmonary edema and requires respiratory support.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema caused by mitral regurgitation (MR) exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and worsening renal function.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient likely developed atrial fibrillation with RVR as a result of MR and decompensated heart failure. Amiodarone was initially started but then discontinued due to concern of QTc prolongation in association with anti-psychotics. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes out.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension with very labile pressures ranging from 120 to 240 systolic. This hypertension often worsens with agitation and delirium, but improves with sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old individual with resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, leading to the decision of making them DNR/DNI with palliative care arrangements for home BIPAP and dilaudid PCA with home hospice. The patient's current medical issues include hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and poor renal function, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response likely resulting from mitral regurgitation with an element of decompensated heart failure, and acute on chronic renal failure. Other concerns include agitation, acute kidney injury, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation. This can result in further deterioration of the patient's condition and potentially lead to cardiac arrest or brain damage.
2. Resistant systolic hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure is difficult to control, which increases the risk of complications such as hemorrhagic stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
3. Pulmonary edema: Fluid accumulation in the lungs can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Poor renal function: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body. This"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. The patient's condition has been worsening, leading to a decision of palliative care and home hospice arrangements.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and worsening renal function could lead to inadequate oxygenation, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which can further exacerbate underlying hypertension and increase the risk of complications.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient has a history of AFib with RVR, which is likely due to mitral regurgitation (MR) and decompensated heart failure. This condition may lead to irregular heart rhythm and potentially serious cardiac events.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is poor, and there is a concern for acute deterioration. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity of medications, and other complications.

5. Agitation and delirium: The patient's abnormal sleep-wake cycles and delirium can make it challenging to manage their condition and may increase the risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications associated with agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   # Disposition: now DNR/DNI with palliative care making arrangements for
   home BIPAP and dilaudid PCA with home hospice
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and poor renal function. Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Patient has resistant systolic HTN and is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **]
   reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and we are unable to improve
   BP control.
   - continue current HTN regimine
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema results from physiology
   and not fluid status
   # AF with RVR:  likely resulted from MR with element of decompensated
   HF. Amiodarone initially started but then discontinued for concern of
   QTc prolongation w/ anti-psychotics. Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate and BP control
   - defer anticoagulation as not c/w long term GOC
   #. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delirium and improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   -8.5L for [**Location 4982**] defer additional diuresis
   #. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - update Geriatrics re: goals of care
   #. Prophylaxis: PPI, needs bowel regimine
   #. Access: a-line, PICC
   #. Code: DNR/DNI
   #. Communication:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 738**] [**Known lastname 739**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8441**]) - Health Care Proxy

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old individual with resistant hypertension in the setting of pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. They have been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, unknown allergies, and a rash from Lasix (Furosemide). The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**2126-8-27**] at 08:17 AM.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including Heparin Sodium, Morphine Sulfate, and Hydromorphone (Dilaudid). They are also on other ICU medications, but the specific names are not mentioned in the progress note.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 56 bpm (51-61 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 197/52 mmHg (98/86-129/76 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (18-36 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on high-flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's weight is currently 51.2 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 52.3 kg. Their height is 60 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1061"
