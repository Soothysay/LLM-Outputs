   This 88M with h/o CAD, CHF, DM, and prior DVT presents with rigors,
   n/v.
   .
   * Septic shock
   Hypotension most likely secondary to sepsis, with suspected underlying
   pneumonia. However pt also has pyuria, so a GU source is another
   possible source. Pt reports n/v raising question of GI source, but
   abdomen is benign and LFTs, lipase fairly unremarkable.
   - Appears well volume resuscitated currently (targeting CVP 8-10)
   - Continue levophed MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, needs to have foley placed
   - Follow up urine, blood, sputum cultures
   .
   * Pneumonia
   Respiratory status improved this AM
   Pt coming from home without recent hospitalizations since the winter,
   therefore more highly resistant organisms less likely. Sputum ~10 years
   prior in OMR with M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae. Further back, he did
   have Sternotrophomonas. GI symptoms raise question of legionella.
   History and chest film less suggestive of a viral pna (eg influenza).
   - Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin
   - Sputum gram stain and cx
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Follow up cultures and CIS
   .
   * [**Name (NI) **]
   Pt with mildly elevated transaminases and total bilirubin, priors from
   [**4-15**] were within normal limits. Might have mild hepatic congestion
   given CHF. [**Month (only) 8**] also reflect systemic infection. Think cholangitis or
   acute viral hepatitis much less likely.
   - Add on direct bilirubin
   - Continue to follow daily
   - Obtain RUQ/ US
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Review of OMR shows prior plts in the low 100's; he is slightly down
   from baseline today. Think DIC less likely, though must be vigilant in
   setting of sepsis. Fibrinogen WNL
   - Continue to follow CBC daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with rigors, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia, as well as urinary tract infection (UTI) and possibly gastrointestinal (GI) source. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires respiratory support. He also has mild hepatic congestion and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lung pneumonia, which may progress and require more aggressive treatment, including possible intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. UTI: The patient has a suspected urinary tract infection, which could become more severe if not properly managed.
4. GI Infection: Although less likely, the patient's GI symptoms raise the possibility of a GI infection, such as Legionella, which could also lead to sepsis.
5. Hepatic Congestion: The patient has mildly elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating hepatic congestion. This condition could worsen if the patient's heart failure exacerbates.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and a previous deep vein thrombosis. He presents with rigors, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and septic shock, likely secondary to the pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved since the morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock due to suspected pneumonia. It is important to continue aggressive management of his condition, including fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has mildly elevated transaminases and total bilirubin levels, which could indicate hepatic congestion or systemic infection. Further evaluation, including direct bilirubin measurement and RUQ/US, is recommended.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but this may be within his baseline range. Monitoring the CBC daily and ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is necessary.
4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure, and his medications should be adjusted accordingly. Holding beta-blockers and diuretics is appropriate in the setting of hypotension.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD should be managed with continued use of ASA and statins. Holding beta-blockers is appropriate due to the hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 88M with h/o CAD, CHF, DM, and prior DVT presents with rigors,
   n/v.
   .
   * Septic shock
   Hypotension most likely secondary to sepsis, with suspected underlying
   pneumonia. However pt also has pyuria, so a GU source is another
   possible source. Pt reports n/v raising question of GI source, but
   abdomen is benign and LFTs, lipase fairly unremarkable.
   - Appears well volume resuscitated currently (targeting CVP 8-10)
   - Continue levophed MAP>65, wean as tolerated this AM
   - Follow urine output, needs to have foley placed
   - Follow up urine, blood, sputum cultures
   .
   * Pneumonia
   Respiratory status improved this AM
   Pt coming from home without recent hospitalizations since the winter,
   therefore more highly resistant organisms less likely. Sputum ~10 years
   prior in OMR with M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae. Further back, he did
   have Sternotrophomonas. GI symptoms raise question of legionella.
   History and chest film less suggestive of a viral pna (eg influenza).
   - Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin
   - Sputum gram stain and cx
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Follow up cultures and CIS
   .
   * [**Name (NI) **]
   Pt with mildly elevated transaminases and total bilirubin, priors from
   [**4-15**] were within normal limits. Might have mild hepatic congestion
   given CHF. [**Month (only) 8**] also reflect systemic infection. Think cholangitis or
   acute viral hepatitis much less likely.
   - Add on direct bilirubin
   - Continue to follow daily
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Review of OMR shows prior plts in the low 100's; he is slightly down
   from baseline today. Think DIC less likely, though must be vigilant in
   setting of sepsis. Fibrinogen WNL
   - Continue to follow CBC daily
   .
   * CHF, chronic, diastolic
   Holding BB and lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with rigors, nausea, and vomiting. The patient is currently in the ICU due to suspected septic shock secondary to pneumonia. He is already on norepinephrine and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he appears to be well-volume resuscitated. Foley placement has been planned to monitor urine output. Cultures for urine, blood, and sputum have been ordered. Antibiotics have been continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already suspected to have septic shock, which is a serious complication of an infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lung pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status and may require additional interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, indicating a potential risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and his renal function needs to be closely monitored. AKI can occur due to sepsis and inadequate perfusion.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes and total bilir"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and prior deep vein thrombosis. He presents with rigors, nausea, and vomiting. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, requiring vasopressors and fluids. Initial concern was a pulmonary source of infection due to right-sided infiltrate, but now there is suspicion of a gastrointestinal infection or translocation from the GI/biliary tract. The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, including Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci. He also has pneumonia, which is improving with antibiotics. His liver function tests are mildly elevated but trending down without intervention. There are concerns about underlying liver disease given low albumin, elevated INR, and ascites. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is currently dealing with septic shock and polymicrobial bacteremia. There is a risk of further infections due to his immunocompromised state and indwelling lines/tubes.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Additionally, there is evidence of renal impairment (elevated creatinine) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient presents with rigors and a history of strictures requiring cystoscopic placement of a coude foley catheter.
- Admit blood cultures show GNR and GPC bacteremia, with one of the GNR also being enteric. Antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin.
- SBP trended down overnight, and a 500cc LR bolus was given without an increase, so NE was restarted.
- RUQ ultrasound showed no biliary ductal dilation.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1C (96.9F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 109/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient's lungs have few rales on the right side without wheezing, and they are clear bilaterally.
- The abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present.
- Extremities are warm with bilateral edema palpable pulses.
- The patient is alert and awake, answering appropriately, but has difficulty hearing.
- Labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Chest X-ray shows an old pleural plaque with tracking effusion and decreased right-sided infiltrate.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and prior deep vein thrombosis. He presents with rigors and nausea, and has been diagnosed with septic shock, pneumonia, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving vasopressors, antibiotics, and other supportive care. He has been placed on a diabetic diet and his glycemic control is being managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible pulmonary infection. If not appropriately treated, it can progress to worsening respiratory failure or develop into a more resistant infection.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible liver injury or inflammation. If left untreated, it may lead to liver dysfunction or failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent bleeding events.
5. Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:"

   .
   * Septic shock
   Continues to require small doses of vasopressors, though is clinically
   improved from admission and urine output adequate.
   Initially concerned for pulmonary source given R sided infiltrate
   versus GU infection given pyuria on presenting UA.  The presence of
   polymicrobial bacteremia was unexpected, and suggesting either:
   contamination from skin flora (less likely), or translocation from
   GI/biliary tract. RUQ ultrasound yesterday unremarkable.
   - Appears well volume resuscitated currently (targeting CVP 8-10)
   - Continue levophed MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - Follow up urine and blood cultures, attempt to obtain sputum if
   possible
   - Continue vancomycin for enterococcus, drop zosyn and cipro,  change
   to ceftriaxone for GNR coverage (and CAP)
   - Discuss with family whether he has has had a colonoscopy previously
   - CT abd r/o asbcess

   * Pneumonia
   Respiratory status now much improved, with adequate sats on room air.
   - Antibiotics as above for now, attempt to obtain sputum
   .
   * Transaminitis
   LFTs mildly elevated at admission, but trending down without specific
   intervention.
   Pt with mildly elevated transaminases and total bilirubin, priors from
   [**4-15**] were within normal limits. Might have mild hepatic congestion
   given CHF. [**Month (only) 8**] also reflect systemic infection. Think cholangitis or
   acute viral hepatitis much less likely
 RUQ ultrasound fairly
   unremarkable. Question whether he may have some underlying liver
   disease give low alb and plts, elevated INR, ascites; u/s did not
   comment on cirrhosis specifically

   * Thrombocytopenia
   Slightly down from admission, previously running in the low 100
s. Nl

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname **] has needed pressor support overnight again. He is now
   weaned off levophed and O2 too. He reports a change in his bowel habits
   over the past month (constipation) preceeding this presentation with
   sepsis. He has GNR in blood (
) and enterococcus too. He will benefit
   from an abdominal CT scan today in light of this. We will also check an
   echo today to ensure that his valves are without vegetation. He will
   need ICU level care until he has had no signs of worsening hemodynamic
   instability.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with rigors, nausea, vomiting, and pyuria on presenting urine analysis. He was initially concerned for pulmonary or genitourinary infection, but the presence of polymicrobial bacteremia suggests either contamination from skin flora or translocation from the gastrointestinal/biliary tract. The patient has been well volume resuscitated, with targeted central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10. He continues to require small doses of vasopressors, and his urine output is adequate. He is currently on antibiotics for enterococcus and gram-negative rods (GNR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with rigors, nausea, vomiting, and bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection. The presence of polymicrobial bacteremia suggests a severe infection that could lead to sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The initial concern for a pulmonary source given the right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray indicates a possible pneumonia. The respiratory status has improved, but there is still a need to obtain sputum for culture.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has slightly low platelet count, which might be due to underlying liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with rigors and was unable to have a coude foley catheter placed at the bedside due to a history of strictures. A cystoscopic placement was performed by urology. The patient also had bacteremia with Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs. Blood cultures showed GNR, with one of the three also showing GPC. Sensitivity results are pending. The patient was given changes in antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's serum bilirubin trended down overnight, so normal saline bolus was given without an increase in SBP. The patient's RUQ ultrasound did not show biliary ductal dilation. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The presence of GNR and GPC bacteremia suggests an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and watch for any signs of sepsis or worsening infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be related to sepsis, heart failure, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate fluid management is necessary.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray"

","Summary:
The patient is a pleasant elderly man who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been weaned off pressors and clinically improved. However, the micro has not been fully specified, and there are some findings on the CT scan that need further evaluation. The patient's allergies and last doses of antibiotics are documented. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 109/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on NRB, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg. The patient is mildly tachypneic and has bilateral rales in the lungs, more prominent on the right side. There is also a soft systolic murmur at the apex and a well-healed sternotomy scar. The abdomen is soft and nontender with bowel sounds, and there are signs of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with edema and hyperpigmentation on the right lower extremity. Neurological examination reveals alertness and no gross deficits. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell"

   * Pneumonia- Respiratory status now much improved, with adequate sats
   on room air.
   -prn inhalers for wheezing which may be related to some element of
   cardiogenic edema given pos fluid balance
   -ABX as above
   -follwup imaging to assess effusion. If develops fevers, decompensates
   will pursue drainage
   * Thrombocytopenia- Slightly down from admission, previously running in
   the low 100

   Assessment and Plan
   * Septic shock- lungs, GI, GU tracts as possible sources with
   bacteremia
   - Appears well volume resuscitated currently (targeting CVP 8-10), off
   pressors
   - Follow up urine and blood cultures, attempt to obtain sputum if
   possible
   - Continue vancomycin for enterococcus, ceftriaxone for GNR coverage
   (and CAP)
   * Pneumonia- Respiratory status now much improved, with adequate sats
   on room air.
   -prn inhalers for wheezing which may be related to some element of
   cardiogenic edema given pos fluid balance
   -ABX as above
   -follwup imaging to assess effusion. If develops fevers, decompensates
   will pursue drainage
   * Thrombocytopenia- Slightly down from admission, previously running in
   the low 100
s. Nl fibrinogen arguing against DIC. [**Month (only) 8**] have some
   underlying liver disease as above which could be contributory.
   - Continue to follow CBC daily
   * CHF, chronic, diastolic- Holding BB and lasix in the setting of
   hypotension
   * CAD- Continue [**Month (only) 119**] and statin, holding BB as above. Tropn low level
   elevation consistent with priors in OMR.
   * DM- Hold home glipizide, cover with sliding scale goal
   fingersticks<150
   * BPH with h/o urethral stricture
   -Foley placed by urology, DC when off pressors and BP stable

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR bacteremia, as well as multilobar pneumonia. He has been weaned off pressors and is currently stable. The patient has a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia with a urethral stricture. He is currently on multiple medications including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and medications for his chronic conditions. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, and his respiratory support is minimal. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows mild bowel wall thickening and a loculate right effusion with a rim suggesting plaque versus empyema. The patient's condition is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and targeted antibiotic therapy based on blood culture results. He will continue to be monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's current condition is septic shock due to bacteremia and multilobar pneumonia. It is important to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
