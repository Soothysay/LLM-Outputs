   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   77W recent NSTEMI requiring 3 stents [**8-29**]. This was complicated by
   cadiogenic shock requiring balloon pump for 3 days. She was ultimately
   transferred to rehab.
   In rehab has experienced hemoptysis and persistent CP. Today dyspnea
   worsened and referred to ER. In ER she was hypotensive and CXR showed
   right pneumomonia. She was placed on levophed. An echo showed EF 20%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent NSTEMI requiring stent placement, cardiogenic shock treated with balloon pump, and subsequent hemoptysis and persistent chest pain in rehab. She presented to the ER with worsening dyspnea and was found to have right pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires norepinephrine infusion for hypotension.

Review of systems shows cardiovascular symptoms including chest pain, respiratory symptoms such as cough and hemoptysis, and no other significant findings. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 68-75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/37-78/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure is within normal range at 10 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1591 mL, output of 740 mL, and a positive balance of 851 mL.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, crackles in the right chest, soft abdomen, no lower extremity edema, and clubbing. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, troponin T of 1.93 ng/mL, glucose of 230 mg/dL, and other lab values"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and atrial fibrillation. She was initially treated with a balloon pump and later experienced hemoptysis and persistent chest pain. She was referred to the emergency room for worsening dyspnea and found to have right pneumonia. An echo showed an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion and other ICU medications. She has a history of allergies to no known drugs, recent antibiotic use, and significant medical history including myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with right pneumonia, which indicates a possible hospital-acquired infection.
2. Shock: The patient's hypotension may be related to infection in the setting of a depressed ejection fraction. She will continue to receive levophed and gentle hydration.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation issues are presumed to be due to excess coumadin. Vitamin K will be given to address this.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely due to potential medication effects and underlying conditions.
5. Recent myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy: The patient's recent MI and cardiomyopathy will require ongoing management with antiplatelet therapy (ASA and pl"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB, found to be hypotensive.
   # Hypotension:  This is mostly likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia
   in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.  In
   addition, U/A is equivocal.  As far as cardiogenic reasons for shock,
   EF is 20% on prelim ECHO read and reportedly stable per son-in-law.
   Unlikely to have restent thrombosis or second ACS event as CK, CK-MB
   are flat.  Trop is likely coming down.  Unfortuantely, there are no
   records from [**Hospital3 1004**] available yet.  Patient may also be slightly
   volume depleted.
   - bcxs, ucx, sputum cx, c. diff
   - broaden coverage for HAP with vanc/zosyn
   - trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - follow up final ECHO
   - IVFs, difficult to have CVP goal given recent massive MI
   - cont. levophed
   - needs aline
   .
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Unlikely to be C. diff
   given co-treatment of levaquin with flagyl.
   - check c. diff
   - hold on c. diff treatment for now
   .
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just massive anterior MI.
   - serial CEs, EKGs
   - cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.
   - follow coags
   - vitamin K 10 mg IV
   - hold coumadin
   - FFP if actively bleeding
   .
   # Elevated Creatinine:  Cr at [**Hospital3 1004**] was 1.5.  Unclear what it was
   prior to that admission.
   - will get PCP records

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for 3 days and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath, hypotension, and reports of diarrhea. She has a preliminary ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and pneumonia suggest a possible septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of recent massive NSTEMI and subsequent stent placement indicates underlying CAD. There is a risk of further ischemic events or complications related to her coronary arteries.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's poor EF and history of cardiogenic shock, there is a possibility of recurrence. This can be particularly concerning if the patient's cardiac function deteriorates further.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's recent use of Flagyl and symptoms of diarrhea raise suspicion for CDI. If confirmed, appropriate treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent worsening of the condition.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) may indicate hepatic dysfunction, potentially due to"

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI (based on q-waves and severly depressed
   ef, record pending) at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents IABP x 3 days for
   cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin,
   presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in septic shock
   requiring pressors
   # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock,
   but will continue to rule out MI given worsened status this am.
   - F/U cultures
   - SWITCH vanc/zosyn to vanco/cefepime/cipro
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; needs a-line

   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI, who presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock, requiring pressors. Her current condition indicates distributive shock, likely caused by right lower lobe pneumonia poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction post recent myocardial infarction. There is also a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection contributing to her symptoms. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumonia. If not properly managed, the infection can spread to other organs, leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing put her at risk for developing ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's acutely depressed ejection fraction post recent myocardial infarction increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, which can occur if the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDIFF): The patient's marked leukocyt"

   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   Off pressors with CVP of 12.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.
   - Continue albuterol MDI (not tolerated nebs)
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Pt intubated due to persistent resp distress and high WOB.
   Oxygenation adequate, will check ABG
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.
   - Follow coags
   - Check to see if on SQ heparin at rehab to explain elevated PTT
   - Hold coumadin
   - Check DIC labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, for which she underwent stenting. She also had pneumonia treated with antibiotics and cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient presents now with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea. She is hypotensive and hypoxemic. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia and poor left ventricular ejection fraction from the recent massive NSTEMI. Pressors have been weaned off with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12. 
   - Follow-up cultures should be obtained.
   - Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
   - Trend C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and serial electrocardiograms (EKGs).
   - Obtain records from Hospital3.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with an asthma flare. 
   - Continue albuterol metered-dose inhaler (MDI) instead of nebulized treatments due to intolerance.
   - Start steroids for the asthma flare.
   - Intubation was performed due to persistent respiratory distress and high work of breathing (WOB). Oxygenation is adequate,"

   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB, found to be hypotensive.
   # Hypotension:  This is mostly likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia
   in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.  In
   addition, U/A is equivocal.  As far as cardiogenic reasons for shock,
   EF is 20% on prelim ECHO read and reportedly stable per son-in-law.
   Unlikely to have restent thrombosis or second ACS event as CK, CK-MB

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, for which she underwent 3 stents placement and experienced cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. The patient presents from rehabilitation with increasing shortness of breath, found to be hypotensive. She has been diagnosed with septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumonia, poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from the recent massive NSTEMI, and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock from RLL pneumonia: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock caused by right lower lobe pneumonia. This condition can worsen if not properly managed with antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is only 20%, indicating reduced heart function. This may lead to further cardiac complications and poor perfusion to vital organs.
3. C. diff infection: The patient reports diarrhea and may have developed C. diff infection. If not treated appropriately, it can cause severe colitis and complications.
4. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of massive NSTEMI and poor EF, there is a possibility of recurrent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, three stents, cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for three days, and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. The patient presents from rehab with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea. She is hypotensive and hypoxemic upon examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from the recent massive NSTEMI. The patient may also have developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection given her symptoms of diarrhea while being treated with Flagyl. Pressors have been weaned off, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 12.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare. She is experiencing difficulty tolerating nebulized albuterol and requires alternative methods of administration. Steroids should be started, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is needed for further evaluation.

3. Diarrhea: The patient reports a week-long history of diarrhea, which could be due to C. diff infection. However, it is unlikely since she recently took Flagyl. The elevated white blood cell (WBC) count prompted the initiation of oral vancom"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with respiratory distress and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of anterior septal STEMI, for which they received stents in the left anterior descending artery. They also have a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 35, indicating possible heart failure or fluid overload. The patient was on levophed and dopamine at outside hospital (OSH) to support blood pressure and cardiac output.

The patient has a high white blood cell count (WBC) of 37.5, which suggests an infection. They were treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with levofloxacin and given Flagyl empirically for Clostridium difficile given diarrhea. The patient still required neomycin overnight.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI (based on q-waves and severly depressed
   ef, record pending) at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents IABP x 3 days for
   cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin,
   presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in septic shock
   requiring pressors
   # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock,
   but will continue to rule out MI given worsened status this am.
   - F/U cultures
   - SWITCH vanc/zosyn to vanco/cefepime/cipro
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; needs a-line
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea:  Empiric CDIFF covg given marked leukocytosis with PO
   vanco. f/u cdiff tox x2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes trending down
   suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively stable, some
   rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed as above
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI (heart attack), coronary artery disease, and septic shock. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, anxiety, and septic shock. The patient had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, and required pressors for septic shock. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to her hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing.

2. Septic shock: The patient is in septic shock requiring pressors for hemodynamic support. She has signs of distributive shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, and poor peripheral perfusion. The source of infection seems to be right lower lobe pneumonia, but Clostridium difficile infection may also be contributing.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI): The patient had a recent STEMI and underwent stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. She also has a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. There is concern for recurrent MI or worsening cardiac function.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia"

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and serial CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic
   shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; A-LINE attempts failed, will trend serial ABGS and
   venous gases
   - will attempt to wean PSV from [**11-24**] to [**9-24**], RSBI 28, goal extubate
   tomorrow if tolerates wean
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  Empiric CDIFF covg given marked leukocytosis
   with PO vanco. f/u cdiff tox x2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed as above; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resuming

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. She has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was previously treated with three stents and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. The patient also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levoquin, and presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea. She is still requiring vasopressors for septic shock. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 78 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. Her temperature is 37.6Â°C. 

Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 69 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 24/10 mmHg, and cardiac output (CO) of 4.2 L/min. 

The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,619 mL and output of 1,325 mL, resulting in a balance of 294 mL. 

Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 37.5 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 4 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 1.93 ng/mL. Other lab values indicate kidney dysfunction, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral pulses or skin assessment. Neurological assessment is also not performed. 

The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. The assessment suggests that the patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia with some contribution from asthma, as well as possible left ventricular failure from ischemia. The patient's septic shock is likely caused by right lower lobe pneumonia, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that acute coronary syndrome is not contributing to her current condition. However, there are still 80% lesions in the mid and distal left anterior descending artery (LAD), along with a 90% circumferential lesion that have not been intervened upon. 

The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis raise concerns for Clostridium difficile infection, for which she has been empirically covered"

   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Genlte IVF + wean pressors

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Now intubated.
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history including a recent massive NSTEMI, three stents, cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) due to recent massive NSTEMI. The patient may also have developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, although she recently took Flagyl, which is used to treat C. diff.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare. She is now intubated and receiving respiratory support.
3. Diarrhea: The patient reports one week of diarrhea, which could be C. diff. An elevated white blood cell count prompted the initiation of oral vancomycin (PO vanc).
4. Chronic CAD with recent STEMI and EF 20%: The patient has chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and reduced EF. There are no acute ischemic changes on the EKG,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   Off pressors with CVP of 12.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.
   - Continue albuterol MDI (not tolerated nebs)
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Pt intubated due to persistent resp distress and high WOB.
   Oxygenation adequate, will check ABG
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.
   - Follow coags
   - Check to see if on SQ heparin at rehab to explain elevated PTT
   - Hold coumadin
   - Check DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, three stents, cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump, and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She presents with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with multifactorial hypotension due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia and poor left ventricular ejection fraction from the recent massive NSTEMI. She also has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare, for which she has been intubated. Additionally, the patient reports a week of diarrhea and has an elevated white blood cell count, prompting the initiation of oral vancomycin. Further tests are needed to confirm Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's cardiac status is complicated by coronary artery disease, recent STEMI, and now reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 20%). There are no acute ischemic changes on EKG, and the patient is currently in sinus rhythm. Other issues include coagulopathy with elevated PTT, and potential complications such as acute kidney injury and stress ulcers. The patient is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare.
3. Clostridium difficile infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI (heart attack) that required stent placement and was complicated by cardiogenic shock. She also had pneumonia treated with antibiotics, and now presents with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is multifactorial and may be due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia, poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI, and possibly Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. 

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has likely pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

3. Diarrhea: The patient reports a week of diarrhea, which could be due to C. diff infection. Elevated white blood cell count prompted the initiation of oral vancomycin.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and had a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%). There are no acute ischemic changes on the current EKG, and the patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and serial CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic
   shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes

   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who recently experienced a STEMI and underwent stenting and IABP for cardiogenic shock. She was also treated for pneumonia with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presented with increasing shortness of breath, diarrhea, and is now in septic shock. She was intubated due to increased work of breathing. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to a recent pneumonia with some contribution from asthma. There is also a concern for LV failure from ischemia, but this is less likely given the normal CVP.

2. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumonia, which is poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction following a recent myocardial infarction. Clostridium difficile infection may also be contributing to the condition.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which recently led to a STEMI. Although she underwent stenting and IABP, she now has an ejection fraction of 20%, indicating significant cardiac damage.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI, which can occur in the setting of sepsis, hypotension,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. She had a recent STEMI and underwent stent placement and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy for cardiogenic shock. The patient also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and she presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She is currently in the ICU requiring pressors for septic shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia if not properly managed.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to further hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD with a recent STEMI. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or worsening heart failure due to compromised coronary arteries.
4. Diarrhea/Leukocytosis: The patient is experiencing diarrhea and leukocytosis, which could be signs of Clostridium difficile infection. Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent complications such as sepsis or bowel perforation.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), s/p (status post) 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for 3 days and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presents from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, likely due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor ejection fraction from recent massive NSTEMI. The plan includes following up on cultures, continuing vancomycin/cefepime/cipro (adjusting doses based on improved creatinine), discontinuing C. difficile coverage given no stool output here, and gently increasing intravenous fluids while weaning off pressors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), three stents, cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for three days, and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She presents from rehabilitation with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia and poor ejection fraction from recent massive NSTEMI. Potential complications may include organ hypoperfusion, acute kidney injury, and tissue hypoxia.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare. Intubated on October 23rd. Potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient has a history of Afib, currently in sinus rhythm. Potential complications may include stroke, thromboembolism, and arrhythmia recurrence.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient had a recent STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and now has an ejection fraction of 20%. Potential complications may include recurrent myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and arr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She presents from rehabilitation with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension due to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI. She also has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), now with EF of 20%. The patient was intubated on 10/23 and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia and poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI. The patient requires further evaluation and management to stabilize her blood pressure.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare. She requires continued treatment for pneumonia and weaning off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which was complicated by a recent STE"

   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.

   acutely depressed LVEF

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who has recently experienced a STEMI (heart attack) and underwent stent placement and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for cardiogenic shock. She was treated for pneumonia and presented with symptoms of respiratory failure, septic shock, coronary artery disease (CAD), and anxiety. The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and is currently dependent on neorolevophed for hemodynamic support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of hypoxemic respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.

2. Septic shock: The patient is still in septic shock, as evidenced by the requirement of vasopressors and the presence of pneumonia. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has underlying CAD with recent myocardial infarction and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There is a risk of recurrent ischemic events or cardiac complications due to ongoing ischemia and potential for further coronary artery blockages.

4. Cardiogenic shock: Although the patient has been weaned off levophed, there is still a risk of recurrent cardiogenic shock due"

","The patient's medical history indicates that they have been in the ICU for several days, experiencing respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. They are currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and are unable to wean off due to borderline blood pressure even with the use of a pressor. Their central venous pressure (CVP) is within average range, but they still require a small dose of neotime. The patient has been on antibiotics since October 24th, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly elevated, with a maximum temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius and a current temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius. Their heart rate is stable at 88 beats per minute, blood pressure is borderline, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is consistently above 99%. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and platelet count. Creatinine levels have been fluctuating, with a highest level of 1.6 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels have also been elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination findings are not fully documented, with assessments incomplete for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  .Tolerating SBT well this am.
   - extubate, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  d/c empiric CDIFF covg given lack of
   diahrrea. f/u cdiff tox x2 when stools
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a recent STEMI (heart attack) and undergoing stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for cardiogenic shock. She also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She is now in septic shock requiring pressors, and was intubated due to increased work of breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with some contribution from asthma.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia, which is poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction (EF) following a recent myocardial infarction.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, including a recent STEMI, and now has an EF of 20%. There are 80% lesions in the mid and distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, as well as a 90% lesion in a circumflex artery. These lesions have not been intervened upon as they were not felt to be the culprits in the acute MI.
4. Diarrhea/Leukocytosis: The patient had diarrhea and leukocytosis, but empirical coverage for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, treated with stenting, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She presents with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD) post recent STEMI, and atrial fibrillation (afib).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia superimposed on asthma flare, resulting in severe hypoxemia requiring intubation. Extubation is planned today, and weaning of oxygen should be done cautiously with monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG).
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD) post recent STEMI: The patient had a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a reduced ejection fraction of 20%. There are no acute ischemic changes on the EKG, indicating old anterior myocardial infarction."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at OSH 10 days ago, which required three intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and was complicated by cardiogenic shock. She also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. The patient presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress progressing into acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and asthma flare.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Multifactorial with septic shock from right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely HCAP with superimposed asthma flare. Extubated on 10-24. On room air.
   - Continue albuterol MDI.
   - Steroids started for asthma flare.
3. CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: EKG shows no acute ischemic changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, high-dose atorvastatin.
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix, and restart when BP allows.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior. PE unlikely given
   supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 6 of 8 for HA pna
   - day 4 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -1L if BP tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -Cardiology consult to eval whether hypoxia [**1-22**] cardiac etiology given
   recent STEMI
   -bilateral LENIs
if negative, consider CTA tomorrow if continues to be
   hypoxic
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She has a history of recent STEMI, for which she received three stents and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for cardiogenic shock. The patient presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, leading to septic shock and reintubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and increased work of breathing. The medical team suspects a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) but has ruled it out due to the patient being on Coumadin. They have also considered cardiac etiology for the hypoxia given the recent STEMI.

The patient has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and has undergone coronary artery disease intervention. There are still 80% lesions in the mid and distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) along with a 90% circumflex artery lesion that have not been addressed.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate normal oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.2 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1"

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   - completed course of steroids
   -continue MDIs
   -consider trial of diuresis today, as pressure tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -consider repeat echo
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated. No further evants like that
   overnight.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI, who underwent stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levaquin. The patient presented with increasing shortness of breath, diarrhea, and septic shock, requiring reintubation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She has hypotension, which resolved after starting broad-spectrum antibiotics and maintaining adequate fluid balance. Her oxygen requirement is high, and she has right lower lobe pneumonia that is poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction (EF) post-myocardial infarction. The physician suspects sepsis rather than cardiogenic shock as the cause of hypotension, given the stable EKG and serial cardiac enzymes trending down.

The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing, likely due to pneumonia, asthma, and possibly fluid overload. The physician attempted to wean ventilation but decided to continue mechanical ventilation. Diarrhea and leukocytosis have resolved.

The patient's CAD, post-recent STEMI, is now associated with an EF of 20%. Cardiac enzymes are continually trending down, suggesting that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing. The EKG is relatively stable, but there are rate-dependent ST depressions"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI, who presented to the ICU with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She has a background of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was previously treated with stents and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. The patient was admitted with septic shock, reintubated, and diagnosed with acute respiratory failure. She has an acutely depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20% following a recent myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.40, PaCO2 43 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 343, and respiratory system compliance of 40.9 cmH2O/mL. The patient has leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.2 K/uL, and a high lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. Cultures are pending. The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds at the right lung base and diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally. The patient has a history of pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. The patient's recent medical history includes a STEMI treated with stents and IABP, pneumonia treated with antibiotics, and admission from rehabilitation with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction. The EKG shows some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly. The patient has undergone several interventions, including intubation, invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and administration of various medications. The patient's family has been informed about the situation, and code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent pneumonia treated with antibiotics, and current symptoms such as bronchial breath sounds at the right lung base and diffuse expiratory wheezes may indicate a possible recurrence of pneumonia.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of recent STEMI and acutely depressed EF of 20% puts her at risk for cardiogenic shock, which can lead to hypotension and poor tissue perfusion.
3. Sepsis: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, secondary to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient required invasive ventilation and an arterial line due to a run of ventricular tachycardia and hypotension after intubation, which resolved with a 500cc bolus. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C (97.7Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 mmHg to 91/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with bronchial breath sounds at the right base and diffuse expiratory wheezes. Other physical exam findings are unremarkable.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging is not provided.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, arterial line, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   - completed course of steroids
   -continue MDIs
   -consider trial of diuresis today, as pressure tolerates
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old female who recently experienced a STEMI (heart attack) and underwent stent placement and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy for cardiogenic shock. She was also treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. The patient was reintubated overnight due to septic shock, and her current conditions include respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's recent medical history includes a STEMI 10 days ago, pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levaquin, and admission from a rehabilitation facility with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, reintubated overnight, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Her lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin-T levels, and signs of renal dysfunction. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing to her current condition. The EKG shows some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly.

The patient's medical plan includes ongoing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She will continue to be monitored for sepsis and her fluid balance will be managed carefully. The healthcare team is considering a trial of diuresis today to address potential fluid overload. The"

 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   - completed course of steroids
   -continue MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI (heart attack), who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. 

The patient had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levaquin, presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, and was reintubated overnight due to septic shock. The hypotension resolved with a 500cc bolus and did not require pressors. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a likely right lower lobe pneumonia, poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction (EF) following a recent myocardial infarction. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing. However, the patient has an EF of 20%, indicating significant heart damage. 

The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis have resolved, but she continues to experience hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased work of breathing. The medical team is attempting to wean ventilation and has completed a course of steroids. 

The patient's cardiac medications include ASA (aspirin), Plavix, high-dose atorvastatin, and she is advised to continue these medications. Beta-blockers (BB) and ACE inhibitors are being held due to hypotension, but may be restarted in the morning. The patient is also advised to maintain a therapeutic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. The patient required invasive ventilation due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. An arterial line was placed, and the patient experienced a run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) but resolved without requiring pressors after a 500cc bolus. The patient is on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, lorazepam, and furosemide.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5Â°C (97.7Â°F) with a current temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F), heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly low, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and there has been a weight gain of 2.1 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,816 mL and output of 1,780 mL with a positive balance of 36 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 34, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and compliance of 40.9 cmH2O/mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, treated with stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She presents with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress, leading to acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and asthma flare.

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI. She is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for 8 days. She is off pressors since the morning.

The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to HCAP with a superimposed asthma flare. She was previously intubated but has been extubated and is now on room air. She is being given albuterol through a metered-dose inhaler and steroids for the asthma flare.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent STEMI, resulting in an EF of 20%. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows no acute ischemic changes, per cardiology, indicating an old massive anterior myocardial infarction (MI). She is being continued on aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, who presented from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress progressing into acute respiratory failure. The patient was diagnosed with HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) and asthma flare. She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to acute respiratory distress. The etiology of this event is unclear, but it could be attributed to volume status, anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE (pulmonary embolism), or acute bronchospasm.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, and acute bronchospasm. The treatment plan includes continuing albuterol MDI, steroids for asthma flare, Lasix gtt for diuresis, antibiotics for HAP, Versed gtt for anxiety, and LE dopplers to rule out DVT as PE is considered for the acute episode last pm. The patient's recent medical history includes a massive NSTEMI, for which she underwent stenting, and subsequently developed cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for three days and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and subsequent reintubation indicate a worsening of respiratory function. This could be due to pulmonary edema,"

   clear today. Serial CXR
s mostly identify ongoing fluid overload though

   rapidly weaned and she currently looks comfortable on PSV.
   CXR is not suggestive of a new HAP, airway pathophysiology feasible but
   not highly c/w the improvt in lung exam, in the absence of additional
   intervention. Recent decompensation could be from volume overload as
   her borderline BP
s have prevented us from diuresing her before.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history significant for recent massive NSTEMI, subsequent stent placement, and cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She presented from rehabilitation with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress, progressing into acute respiratory failure. The patient was initially diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) with a superimposed asthma flare. She was extubated on October 24th but developed acute respiratory distress on October 25th and required reintubation. The cause of the respiratory distress is unclear, but possible factors include volume status, anxiety, oversedation with lorazepam, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute bronchospasm. 

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, attributed to septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from the recent massive NSTEMI. The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for HAP, as well as versed for anxiety. Lower extremity (LE) Doppler studies are being performed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as a consideration for the acute episode last night. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today showed a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 37, indicating readiness for ext"

   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, treated with stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presents with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress progressing into acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and asthma flare. The patient was extubated on 10/24 but required reintubation due to acute respiratory distress. She now appears extubatable but with an unclear event leading to reintubation. Differential includes pulmonary edema, anxiety, oversedation with Ativan, HAP, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute bronchospasm. Current plan includes continuing albuterol MDI, steroids for asthma flare, Lasix gtt for diuresis, abx for HAP, Versed gtt for anxiety, and LE dopplers to rule out DVT as PE is considered for the acute episode last pm. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is planned today with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 37. PS will be decreased to 5/5 and possible extubation later based on the results. Cardiology consult is requested. The patient's hypotension is multifactorial with septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor ejection fraction from recent massive N"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD) following a recent STEMI. She underwent stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy for cardiogenic shock. The patient also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and levaquin, presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, and was reintubated overnight. Her condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and increased work of breathing. She has shown improvement in leukocytosis and cardiac enzymes, but remains in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors including pneumonia, asthma, and fluid overload. There is a need to continue weaning ventilation and monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: Despite improvement in leukocytosis and cardiac enzymes, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to her recent infection and compromised immune system. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular culture follow-ups are necessary to detect any potential sepsis recurrence.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent STEMI and reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20% indicate an increased risk for cardiac complications. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes, EKG changes, and ongoing cardiology consultations are important to prevent further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent STEMI, who presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was initially treated for pneumonia but was found to have septic shock and required reintubation. The patient had undergone three stents and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She also has coronary artery disease (CAD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to her underlying CAD and recent myocardial infarction, as well as the development of pneumonia. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation is necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's septic shock has resolved but there is a possibility of recurrence if her infections are not adequately treated. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, is crucial to detect any signs of sepsis.
3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Increased Work of Breathing: The patient's worsening respiratory distress indicates the need for continued support and monitoring. This could be due to worsening pneumonia or fluid overload.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, and a history of coronary artery disease. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 35%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,082 mL and output of 2,685 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,603 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. Imaging studies reveal multiple pulmonary infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular cultures of tracheal aspirates are necessary to detect early signs of infection.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressures generated during mechanical ventilation can lead to lung injury, such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Regular chest X-rays should be performed to detect any new infiltrates or changes in lung expansion.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improperly set ventilator settings,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and volume overload following a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's medical history includes a recent large STEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery, and cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient also had pneumonia (PNA) and presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB), diarrhea, hypotension, and hypoxemia. She was intubated for worsening respiratory distress but was extubated and placed on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has a history of asthma and completed a course of oral steroids. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for PNA. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and her INR is high on coumadin due to being on ciprofloxacin. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is now re-extubated to a nasal cannula with continued volume overload. She has hypoxemic respiratory failure post-extubation. The plan includes administering CPAP, diuresis with the goal of increasing urine output, and obtaining an arterial blood gas (ABG) this afternoon.

   failure from asthma/HAP.  Extubated earlier this week, only to develop
   acute respiratory distress the evening afterwards requiring

   Oxygen requirement now down to 2liters n.c.- however, it was similarly
   down before she last decompensated. Given that and the apparent degree
   of volume overload, will try pt on NIPPV/CPAP while we continue to

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a recent history of STEMI, who required stent placement and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to cardiogenic shock. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to asthma and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient was initially extubated but developed acute respiratory distress and required re-intubation. Her blood pressure is currently stable and responding well to Lasix infusion. She is still dependent on supplemental oxygen but the requirement has decreased to 2 liters via nasal cannula.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure post-extubation
   - Consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)/CPAP
   - Continue diuretic therapy to manage volume overload

2. s/p STEMI, ejection fraction (EF) 25%
   - Continue aspirin, Plavix, and statin therapy
   - Temporarily hold beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors due to recent hypotension and goal to diurese; reassess in the morning

3. Increasing white blood cell (WBC) count (16)
   - Unclear etiology; PNA being treated, no focal source of infection
   - Possible source of steroids
   - Resend urine analysis and urine culture

4. Vancomycin levels, increase vancomycin dosing in setting of improved acute respiratory failure (ARF)

   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent

   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She has a history of recent STEMI, for which she underwent stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient was treated for pneumonia and presented with septic shock. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, anxiety, and coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The patient's current condition shows that her septic shock has resolved, and her hypoxemic respiratory failure has improved. However, she is experiencing leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.3, which is up from 13.1 two days prior. The patient is also having abdominal cramping and stool output after broad-spectrum antibiotic use. She is afebrile.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing to her condition. Her EKG is relatively stable, but there are some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly. The patient had a run of ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's plan includes continuing empiric vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection, sending a C. diff test, and performing urinalysis, urine culture, and blood cultures. She should continue ASA, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors should be resumed as soon as possible, while aggressively diuresizing."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She had a recent STEMI and underwent stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for cardiogenic shock. She also had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and was admitted from a rehabilitation center with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. The patient has a history of recent myocardial infarction, CAD, and asthma.

The patient initially presented with septic shock secondary to distributive shock, oxygen requirement in the setting of right lower lobe pneumonia, and poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed ejection fraction post-myocardial infarction. She was given a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12, stable EKG, and serial cardiac enzymes (CE) trending down, strongly favoring sepsis over cardiogenic shock. Cultures were negative, and she completed an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin empirically for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

She also had hypoxemic respiratory failure/increased work of breathing, likely due to post-nasal drip, asthma, and fluid overload. This resolved after completing 8 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics for HCAP, 5 days of steroids for asthma, and discontinuing non-invasive ventilation as the patient did not"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which could be due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or pneumonia. This condition is critical and requires immediate attention.

2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing septic shock, likely secondary to a distributive shock caused by RLL pneumonia. It is important to monitor and treat the infection aggressively.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a recent STEMI and underwent stenting. She now has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. There are still 80% lesions in the mid and distal LAD along with a 90% blockage in another coronary artery that have not been intervened upon. This indicates ongoing cardiac issues and potential complications related to CAD.

4. Anxiety: The patient is also diagnosed with anxiety, which may be related to her current medical condition and hospitalization.

5. Diarrhea: The patient presented with diarrhea, which could be a result of antibiotic-associated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since [**2153-10-27**] 10:43 AM. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Cefipime, and Ciprofloxacin. The patient is currently on infusions of Furosemide and other ICU medications such as Midazolam and Fentanyl. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/75 to 167/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his weight is currently 72.1 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,455 mL and output of 3,090 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,635 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on a BiPAP mask, with a tidal volume of 583 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH at 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 34 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 176 mmHg. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not performed. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's microbiology test shows negative urine culture and blood culture. The assessment includes respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. The plan includes continued ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory symptoms and the need for invasive ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately, this condition could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in respiratory arrest or death.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and increased WBC count, along with the presence of septic shock in the assessment, suggest an ongoing infection. If sepsis progresses, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be fatal.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction. If CAD is not adequately managed,"

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM
   - day 5 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.

She was found to have septic shock, respiratory failure, and anxiety. The patient had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and she also had coronary artery disease with three stents placed. She underwent intra-aortic balloon pumping for cardiogenic shock but was later determined to have septic shock secondary to right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including hypotension, respiratory failure, and worsening white blood cell count. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, and cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is essential to prevent further deterioration.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and aggressive management of infection are crucial to stabilize the patient's condition.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and her recent STEMI has significantly reduced her ejection fraction to 20%. There are still 80% lesions in the mid and distal left anterior descending artery, as well as a 90% blockage in another coronary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of recent large NSTEMI, s/p PCI to LAD with subsequent cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient also had pneumonia (PNA) and presented with increasing shortness of breath, diarrhea, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient was re-extubated to a nasal cannula due to volume overload. 

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure post-extubation and is on CPAP. There is a concern for worsening renal function (ARF), as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, but the etiology is unclear. Pneumonia is being treated, and no focal source of infection has been identified. Steroids could be a possible source of the elevated WBC count. 

The patient has a history of asthma, for which he completed a course of oral steroids. His INR is elevated at 4.7 due to warfarin therapy for his low ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. The plan is to hold warfarin and reassess. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including a recent STEMI with an ejection fraction of 25%. He is on aspirin, Plavix, and a statin. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are deferred today due to recent hypotension and the goal to diurese, with reass"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a recent history of a large STEMI at OSH, who underwent PCI to LAD and subsequently experienced cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She also had pneumonia (PNA) and presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB), diarrhea, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been extubated to a nasal cannula and is showing improvement in volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress after extubation indicate a potential complication of hypoxemic respiratory failure. This may be due to underlying lung pathology or fluid overload.

2. Infection: The patient's increasing white blood cell count (WBC) and presence of fever could suggest an ongoing infection. Since she has been treated for pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin orally, there is a possibility of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which is why C. diff toxin assay has been sent.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR (international normalized ratio) indicates a potential coagulopathy. Coumadin has been held due to the high INR value.

4. Deconditioning: The patient is at risk for deconditioning due to her prolonged ICU stay and limited mobility.

5. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and"
