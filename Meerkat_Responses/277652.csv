   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of hypertension and IVDU presents with
   tachycardia and hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication
   noncompliance.
   1. Hypertension
   Etiology of her hypertension appears most likely secondary to
   medication noncompliance, particularly given the risks of rebound
   hypertension with clonidine use. Additional possibilities include
   benzodiazepine withdrawal as pt reports that she was recently taken off
   of alprazolam and was given diazepam within the last week. Her blood
   pressure has significantly improved since transfer to the floor.
   - restart home meds
   - increase HCTZ to 25mg daily
   - consider adding third [**Doctor Last Name **] such as a CCB tomorrow if BP is still
   elevated
   - titrate off nitro gtt
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   2. Tachycardia
   Differential diagnosis for patient's tachycardia includes dehydration
   or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Regarding benzodiazepine withdrawal,
   patient was previously taking xanax and then her primary care stopped
   providing her xanax. She then went to the ED on [**2114-2-27**] where she was
   prescribed both percocet and valium. If she has taken valium over the
   last week, she has likely tapered off benzodiazepines herself with a
   long acting benzodiazepine. Given that her tachycardia worsened while
   being in the ED, this appears most consistent with a withdrawal
   syndrome.
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue IVF
   3. IVDU
   Patient reports a relapse in heroin use in the last week.
   - Addictions consult once hemodynamically stable
   4. Oral Ulcer
   Unclear etiology for oral ulcer. Differential includes infectious or
   pre-malignant/malignant lesion.
   - swab lesion
   - consider ENT referral in the AM for further evaluation.
   5. Asthma
   Patient appears stable and appears well-controlled on current regimen.
   - continue advair, albuterol prn, and singulair prn
   6. Nausea and vomiting
   Symptoms appear to have resolved now. Etiology is unclear. Differential
   includes gastroenteritis, withdrawal. Abdominal exam benign.
   - antiemetics prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension and intravenous drug use. She presented with tachycardia and hypertensive urgency due to medication noncompliance. The patient's blood pressure has improved since being transferred to the floor. The patient also has an oral lesion of unclear etiology and reports a relapse in heroin use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to dehydration or benzodiazepine withdrawal. If left untreated, it can lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiovascular complications.
3. Intravenous Drug Use (IVDU): The patient's relapse in heroin use puts her at risk for infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, and endocarditis.
4. Oral Ulcer: The oral ulcer could potentially be an infectious lesion or pre-malignant/malignant lesion. If left untreated, it may progress and cause further complications.
5. Nausea and Vomiting: Although the symptoms have resolved, if they were caused by withdrawal or gastroenteritis, the patient may still be at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hypertension appears to be secondary to medication noncompliance, possibly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension and intravenous drug use (IVDU) who presented with tachycardia and hypertensive urgency due to medication noncompliance. She was weaned off nitro drip and given clonidine and HCTZ. Initially, her pressures were too low but have temporarily improved to the 130s. She is currently experiencing hypotension in the 90s. Other notable findings include a white lesion on the hard palate with erythematous surroundings, dehydration, and a history of IVDU.

   - Give fluid boluses to augment blood pressure.
   - consider Yohimbine to counteract clonidine if BP does not improve
   with fluid boluses.
   2. Tachycardia
   Differential diagnosis for patient's tachycardia includes dehydration
   or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Regarding benzodiazepine withdrawal,
   patient was previously taking xanax and then her primary care stopped
   providing her xanax. She then went to the ED on [**2114-2-27**] where she was
   prescribed both percocet and valium. If she has taken valium over the
   last week, she has likely tapered off benzodiazepines herself with a
   long acting benzodiazepine. Given that her tachycardia worsened while
   being in the ED, this appears related to withdrawal syndrome.
   - serum tox negative and urine tox pending
   - monitor on telemetry
   - fluid boluses as above
   3. IVDU
   Patient reports a relapse in heroin use in the last week.
   - Addictions consult once hemodynamically stable
   4. Oral Ulcer
   Unclear etiology for oral ulcer. Differential includes infectious or
   pre-malignant/malignant lesion.  Patient has had tumor on tongue in the
   past with positive margins on biopsy, she has not followed this up.
   - swab lesion
   - call ENT, as they have seen her before.
   5. Asthma
   Patient appears stable and appears well-controlled on current regimen.
   - continue advair, albuterol prn, and singulair prn
   6. Nausea and vomiting
   Symptoms appear to have resolved now. Etiology is unclear. Differential
   includes gastroenteritis, withdrawal. Abdominal exam benign.
   - antiemetics prn
   - continue to follow
   - advance diet PRN

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension and intravenous drug use (IVDU). She presents with tachycardia and hypertensive urgency, likely secondary to medication noncompliance. The patient's blood pressure has significantly improved since being transferred to the floor, but it has now become too low, in the 90s. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypertension: The etiology of hypertension appears most likely secondary to medication noncompliance, particularly given the risks of rebound hypertension with clonidine use. Additional possibilities include benzodiazepine withdrawal as the patient reports being recently taken off alprazolam and given diazepam within the last week. Her blood pressure has significantly improved since transfer to the floor, but has gotten too low, now in the 90s.
- Hold clonidine for now
- Increase HCTZ to 25mg daily, already given in the AM, also hold for now
- Patient titrated off nitro gtt
- F/u urine tox screens, serum tox screen negative
- Give fluid boluses to augment blood pressure.
- Consider Yohimbine to counteract clonidine if BP does not improve with fluid boluses.

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.  I would add/emphasize
   that her blood pressure has come under better control and her
   hypotension has resolved.  This morning she has a moderate headache but
   detailed neurologic exam (motor, sensory, cerebellar, cranial nerves)
   is without focality.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o woman with hypertensive urgency (improved).
   Hypertensive Urgency
   Will need ongoing titration of her medications.  I am concerned that
   her
home medications
 may represent increased doses and numbers o
   fmedications without her always taking them.  She will need a roughly
   stable regimen prior to discharge, given reported trouble following up
   in past.  TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely.
   Nausea/Vomiting
   No resolved
   Oral lesion
   ENT believes this is an aphthous ulcer.  Recommends outpatient
   follow-up.
   History of tongue tumor
   ENT recommends outpatient follow-up.
   Headache
   Exam is very reassuring, in detail.  If headache does not improve, or
   if it occurs with recrudescence of headache, would consider
   intracranial imaging.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypertension. She has a history of mouth lesion, which was diagnosed as an aphthous ulcer and will be followed up with an ENT consult. The patient also experienced feelings of tiredness, muscle aches, and headache, but no more diarrhea or cough. She has no known drug allergies.

Infusions and medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient is also on HCTZ and metoprolol for hypertension management.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Vital signs show a blood pressure reading of 172/110 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,222 mL, including 300 mL of PO and 800 mL of TF, with an output of 3,000 mL of urine and 1,200 mL of NG. The overall balance is 1,222 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft palate ulceration with white exudate, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has intact cranial nerves 2-12 with no dysdiadokinesia"
