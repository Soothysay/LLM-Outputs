 HYPOXEMIA
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef20% prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on cxr, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   .
   #Hypoxic: Patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some
   worsening today with PoA2 62. The patient himself is asymptomatic.
   Wheezing on exam suggests bronchospasm although these have been present
   since admission. Alternatively, he may have cardiogenic wheezes in the
   setting of EF 20%, new lower ext edema and IVF given for pre-contrast.
   CXR is unchanged from the past several days and does not show notable
   pulmonary edema although this may be difficult to see given underlying
   infiltrates. He has now put out 450cc to lasix, but continues to have
   desaturations. Given the pt's prostate CA, the patient should be ruled
   out for PE. In addition, he has been immunosupressed on steroids so HAP
   may be possible.
   - less concern for PE, but still needs CT to look at lung parenchyma
   - if effusion on CT, would tap and send for cytology
   - repeat echo
   - check ABG's
   - continue O2 to maintain sat >93%
   - goal I/O neg one liter today
   - nebs PRN
   - cont steroids: methylprednisone 125mg IV q12
   - cont guiafenasin
   .
   #Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with
   peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"".
   - cont methylprednisolone 125mg q12
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids
   - repeat chest CT
   - may need to consider lung biopsy
   .
   #anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by
   [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 221**]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5797**] [**Doctor Last Name 5109**] of hematology.  Work up thus far is negative
   for iron/folate/B12 deficient.  Thought possibly from hormone therapy
   for prostate CA.  No evidence of hemolysis on admission. Bone marrow
   biopsy pending.
   -daily hct
   - await bone marrow biopsy results
   - appreciate hematology reccs.
   .
   # CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischmia on arrival to ICU,
   chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
   -continue atorvastatin
   -continue ASA
   -cont BB
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   .
   #Chronic Systoic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardiomyopathy -
   Echo [**2-3**] with EF of 20%, PCWP >18, 1+ MR, 1+TR.  Appears mildly volume
   overloaded on arrival to the ICU. Now neg 450cc.
   - monitor volume status
   - cont bb
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   - goal neg 1 liter
   .
   # ARF: resolved, Cr max 1.7 now down to 1.1
   - hold ACEi for contrast study
   .
   # h/o NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD: continue metoprolol
   .
   # h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but patient
   reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his symptoms.  He
   is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5798**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing a subacute course of hypoxia, with some worsening today. He is currently receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. His blood glucose level is within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia. 
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing persistent desaturation despite supplemental oxygen therapy. 
3. Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral eosinophilia, which is most likely acute eosinophilic pneumonia. 
4. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, and it should be considered as a potential cause"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and other medical conditions. The patient presents with dry cough and is found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, now involving the left side. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.

The patient has been diagnosed with diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates, with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) showing 30% eosinophils. His peripheral blood also shows eosinophilia. Tests for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), respiratory viral antigens, BAL for bacterial pathogens, and Legionella were negative. The initial thought is that the patient may have an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like non-steroid responsive bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP).

The patient is being treated with methylprednisolone 125mg IV every 12 hours and bactrim for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids. A repeat chest CT scan without contrast and the possibility of lung biopsy are being considered.

The patient also has anemia that has been present since February 4th, slowly trending down but without any acute drops"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and chronic anemia. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, which have now involved the left side. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. Laboratory tests showed peripheral eosinophilia, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed 30% eosinophils. The patient was treated with IV steroids and given Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A repeat chest CT scan was ordered, and a lung biopsy may be considered. The patient also has anemia, which has been present since February 4th and is slowly trending down. It is not acute or associated with bleeding, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. The workup for iron/folate/B12 deficiency is negative, and it may be related to hormone therapy for prostate cancer. A bone marrow biopsy is pending. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, but no evidence of acute ischemia on arrival to the ICU. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and mild volume overload. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate between 70-78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/59-147/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 300 mL and output of 2,310 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,010 mL. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and requires respiratory support. Peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic assessment, and other systems are not assessed. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (16.2 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.6 g/dL), and platelet count (432 K/uL), while creatinine (1.3 mg/dL) and glucose (133 mg/dL) are within normal limits. Other lab values are also provided. The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia and hypoxemia, and the plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has two IV lines placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. The patient presents with dry cough, hypoxia, and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Over the course of the day, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/54 to 145/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP with SpO2 of 95%. The patient's physical examination revealed slightly more labored breathing compared to the previous day, oriented to time, place, and person, dry crackles in the right lung, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, soft abdomen without tenderness, and no edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and other abnormal values in electrolytes and kidney function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory alkalosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer.

The patient presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on a chest X-ray. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and received invasive ventilation. A repeat CT chest revealed slightly worsening opacities in the left lung. An echo was ordered but not done, and the patient discussed next steps of care and whether they would be amenable for a lung biopsy.

The patient's weight is up 10 pounds since admission, so diuresis with 40 IV lasix was initiated. The patient refused bipap at one point but eventually agreed to use it, but did not tolerate it and changed to CPAP with oxygen saturation levels at 95%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.47/48/58.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Infusions and other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), and morphine sulfate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 117/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a fluid balance of -2007 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pneumonia. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals an absence of peripheral pulses and skin assessment. The patient's neurological examination is also not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The presence of pneumonia is already noted in the assessment and plan.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef 20% prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on cxr now CT scan demonstrated improved
   consolidation but now ground glass has increased.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Initial thoughts he may have ""eosinophilic process
   secondary to malignancy.  Differential is still broad and definitive
   diagnosis would require VATS which he may not tolerate.
   - cont methylprednisolone 125mg q8
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5997**] restart abx with Vanc/Gent
   - SSI while on steroids
   - Will be evaluated for lung biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the morning
   - Will send Histo/Crypto/tularemia studies
   #Hypoxemia-diffuse ARDS process unclear etiology
   -ARDS net ventilation
   -Will attempt to avoid paralytics given steroids by escalating sedation
   #Hypotension-Worsened by NSVT
   -Continue levophen
   -Will check TTE with bubble
   # CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischmia on arrival to ICU,
   chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
   -continue atorvastatin
   -continue ASA
   -Hold BB given hypotension
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   #Chronic Systoic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardiomyopathy -
   Echo [**2-3**] with EF of 20%, PCWP >18, 1+ MR, 1+TR.  Appears mildly volume
   overloaded on arrival to the ICU. Goal negative.
   - monitor volume status
   - cont bb
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   - goal continue neg 2 liter and follow BUN/Cr.
   #anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by

   Attending Note:I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with the ICU team for the key portions of the services
   provided. I agree with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]
s findings and plan. The
   assessment and plan reflects our discussion. I would emphasize and add
   the following points: chart reviewed including radiology and all micro.
   Agree with sending histo Ab, crypto, tularemia Ab and repeat sputum
   culture. I would favor restarting antibiotics with Vanc and Gent (to
   cover the unlikely possibility of tularemia or other uncultured GN).
   Progressive acute respiratory failure is compatible with AIP,
   eosinophilic syndrome exacerbated by CHF in the setting of shock,
   malignancy possibly with lymphangitic spread (has known prostate ca
   which has been associated with eosinophilic pna). Patient is a never
   smoker but with years of unprotected exposure to metal dust as
   machinist.
   Currently on low-tidal volume assist control, peep 15, FiO2 100%. Exam
   as above, crackles at bases, no rashes. He is now pressor-dependent
   (levophed) with goals of keeping MAP>65, intermittent arrhythmias,
   known to EP, but question of reentry tachycardia. Urine output [**8-/2103**]
   cc/hr.
   Prognosis is poor. Rest of the plan per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
- He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, which have been improving but now show increased ground-glass appearance on CT scan.
- BAL reveals 30% eosinophils, and there is peripheral eosinophilia. Tests for PCP, respiratory viral antigens, BAL for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens, and Legionella are negative.
- The initial thought is an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy. Differential diagnosis includes VATS for definitive diagnosis, but the patient may not tolerate it.
- The patient is currently receiving methylprednisolone, Bactrim for PCP, and Vanc/Gent antibiotics.
- The patient has hypoxemia, diffuse ARDS process with unclear etiology, and worsened by NSVT.
- He also has hypotension, worsened by NSVT, and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef 20% prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on cxr now CT scan demonstrated improved
   consolidation but now ground glass has increased.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Initial thoughts he may have ""eosinophilic process
   secondary to malignancy.  Differential is still broad and definitive
   diagnosis would require VATS which he may not tolerate.
   - cont methylprednisolone 125mg q8
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5997**] restart abx with Vanc/Gent
   - SSI while on steroids
   - Will be evaluated for lung biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the morning
   - Will send Histo/Crypto/tularemia studies
   #Hypoxemia-diffuse ARDS process unclear etiology
   -ARDS net ventilation
   -Will attempt to avoid paralytics given steroids by escalating sedation

   -Hold BB given hypotension
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   #Chronic Systoic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardiomyopathy -
   Echo [**2-3**] with EF of 20%, PCWP >18, 1+ MR, 1+TR.  Appears mildly volume
   overloaded on arrival to the ICU. Goal negative.
   - monitor volume status
   - cont bb
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
   - goal continue neg 2 liter and follow BUN/Cr.
   #anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer.
- The patient presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. A subsequent CT scan showed improved consolidation but increased ground glass appearance.
- A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed 30% eosinophils, indicating an eosinophilic process. Peripheral eosinophilia was also noted. The patient tested negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), respiratory viral antigens, and bacterial/viral/fungal pathogens. Legionella was also negative.
- Initial thoughts suggested an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy. Differential diagnosis includes other possibilities that would require a lung biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
- The patient was started on methylprednisolone and bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. Vancomycin and gentamicin were restarted as well.
- The patient's hypoxemia was attributed to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) process of unclear etiology. Noninvasive ventilation was initiated.
- The patient's hypotension worsened due to nonsustained ventricular tachycard"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic systolic heart failure, prostate cancer, and anemia. He was admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, which improved with consolidation but showed increased ground-glass appearance on CT scan. BAL revealed 30% eosinophils, indicating an eosinophilic process. The patient is currently being treated with IV steroids, bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and scheduled for repeat chest CT scan. A lung biopsy may be considered if needed. Other issues include acute renal failure (ARF) that has resolved, anemia, and prostate cancer. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further investigations such as a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Eosinophilic pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest an eosinophilic pneumonia, which can be caused by various triggers including medications, infections, or underlying conditions like malignancy. The response to steroids will determine the effectiveness of treatment.
2. Prostate cancer progression: The patient's prostate cancer requires ongoing management, and the recent skipped hormonal therapy may contribute to disease progression.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs further evaluation, and a bone marrow biopsy may provide"

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on cxr now CT scan demonstrated improved
   consolidation but now ground glass has increased.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Initial thoughts he may have ""eosinophilic process
   secondary to malignancy.  Differential is still broad and definitive
   diagnosis would require VATS which he may not tolerate.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, chronic systolic heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The CT scan showed improved consolidation but increased ground glass. BAL and peripheral eosinophilia were noted, and initial thoughts suggested an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy. Differential diagnosis includes eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or drug reaction.

The patient has been treated with IV steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia and diffuse ARDS. There is no evidence of acute ischemia on arrival to the ICU, and the patient's chest pain is resolved. EKG showed LBBB at baseline, which has not changed.

The patient's chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% has been mentioned, along with mild volume overload. Anemia has been present since 2/4, trending down but without acute drops or evidence of bleeding. Hematology workup is negative for iron/folate/B12 deficiency, and bone marrow biopsy is pending.

Renal failure is suspected due to a rise in creatinine, possibly related to hypotension yesterday. Electrolytes are being monitored, and there are concerns about hypoxemia, pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   Started on Vasopressin last night for ongoing Levophed-dependent shock.
   Vigileo monitoring added this morning and TTE done consistent with
   severe LV dysfunction (EF 25-30%) and moderate pulmonary hypertension
   (TR grad 44). He has shown some improvement overnight with decreased
   FIO2 and PEEP requirements, and decreased Levophed requirement possibly
   as a result of decreasing the peep.
   Discussed case with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. I agree risks of open lung biopsy appear
   to outweigh the potential benefit.This was discussed during today
   family meeting. Several micro studies are pending including
   beta-glucan, galactomannan, tularemia Ab, histo, strongyloides, and
   repeat sputum. Currently on Vanc and Gent, high dose solumedrol (dose
   will be decreased today to 80mg q8h).
   Imp - progressive acute respiratory failure of unclear etiology,
   concerning for: AIP, eosinophilic syndrome exacerbated by CHF in the
   setting of shock, malignancy possibly with lymphangitic spread (has
   known prostate ca which has been associated with eosinophilic pna).
   Patient is a never smoker but with years of unprotected exposure to
   metal dust as machinist.
   He also has shock (probably septic, cardiogenic), recurrent SVT, acute
   renal failure likely ATN, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   Currently on low-tidal volume A/C 350 x 28, peep 12, FiO2 80%. Exam as
   above, with coarse sounds, regular HS, no rashes, LUE edema. He remains
   pressor-dependent (Vasopressin and Levophed) with goals of keeping
   MAP>65. No recurrence of SVT since yesterday - question of reentry
   tachycardia.
   Prognosis remains guarded. Rest of the plan per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]
s note.
   Patient is critically ill. Total time 50 minutes.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer who presents with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient has been admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and BAL showing 30% eosinophils. He has been treated with intravenous steroids.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory support, hypoxemia, and diffuse ARDS process of unclear etiology. He also has hypotension, worsened by NSVT, and suspect increased PEEP as a result of hypotension. There is also a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG and ICD implantation, chronic systolic heart failure, anemia, acute renal failure, and a history of prostate cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and ARDS process indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Continued respiratory support and careful monitoring will be necessary.
2. Shock: The patient is pressor-dependent, suggesting ongoing hypotension and potential shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and prompt treatment will be needed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Further evaluation and management of renal function are essential.
4. Infection: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophils raises concerns for an infectious cause. Continued surveillance for any signs of infection, such as pneumonia or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the hospital with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He presented with hypoxia and was intubated. The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening today, despite being on non-rebreather. He also has wheezing on examination, suggesting bronchospasm or cardiogenic wheezes due to his low ejection fraction. CT scan showed pulmonary edema, as compared to prior that showed more consolidation.

   exam suggests bronchospasm although these have been present since
   admission. Alternatively, he may have cardiogenic wheezes in the
   setting of EF 20%, new lower ext edema and IVF given for pre-contrast.
   CXR is unchanged from the past several days and does not show notable
   pulmonary edema although this may be difficult to see given underlying
   infiltrates.  CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation.

","Summary:
Mr. [Known Lastname 5795] is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, presenting with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated and sedated. The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening today despite being on non-rebreather. Wheezing on exam suggests bronchospasm, which may be due to cardiogenic causes in the setting of his low ejection fraction, new lower extremity edema, and intravenous fluid administration. A computed tomography (CT) scan shows pulmonary edema, as compared to prior imaging that showed more consolidation. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and follow-up CT are planned. Oxygen therapy is continued to maintain saturation above 93%, and nebulizers with bronchodilators are used as needed. Steroids, specifically methylprednisolone, are continued at a dose of 125 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and guaifenesin is also continued.

The patient presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to respiratory support requirements.

The patient experienced hypotension requiring pressors, arterial line, and central venous line placement. He also had runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and there were concerns about possible arrhythmias related to intubation. Anti-arrhythmic medications were not given, and the decision was made to cardiovert or defibrillate if needed for instability.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values including creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes were within normal ranges. The patient had an elevated lactate level, low albumin, and elevated lactic acid.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate between 65-160 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 70-88 mmHg, respiratory rate between 25-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation around"

   Imaging: TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
   normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior
   wall and apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
   inferior wall. There is an anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm.
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
   multi-vessel CAD. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-2-1**], LV
   systolic dysfunction appears regional on the current study (as it did
   on study of [**2130-2-21**]). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, as well as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. He was admitted with symptoms of dry cough, hypoxia, and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient initially experienced hypotension after intubation, which was managed with vasopressors. However, the hypotension persisted despite weaning off the ventilator and diuresis. The cause of hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including reduced venous return from diuresis, intubation/PEEP, sedation, and possibly poor cardiac output due to a reduced LVEF.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient presented with worsening hypoxemia despite being on non-rebreather oxygen therapy. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. The cause of hypoxemia is likely due to a combination of factors, including pneumonia and acute eosinophilic pneumonia.

3. Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates: The patient has diffuse right-sided peripheral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are suggestive of pneumonia. BAL analysis showed 30% eosinophils, and there was also peripheral"

   Imaging: TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
   normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior
   wall and apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
   inferior wall. There is an anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm.
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
   multi-vessel CAD. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-2-1**], LV
   systolic dysfunction appears regional on the current study (as it did
   on study of [**2130-2-21**]). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with dry cough, hypoxia, and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is intubated and sedated, and has been in the ICU for hypoxia. His condition has been complicated by several medical issues including electrolyte and fluid disorders, pneumonia, hypotension, hypercarbia, eosinophilic pneumonia, ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular systolic arrhythmia, renal failure, anemia, and chronic systolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as dry cough and hypoxia, along with the presence of diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, suggest pneumonia. If not treated promptly and effectively, it can progress and lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Eosinophilic pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. Clinically, he shows mild improvement. The patient has peripheral eosinophilia, diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates, and BAL showing 30% eosinophils. Initial thoughts suggest an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy, but a definitive diagnosis would require video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). 

The patient is currently receiving methylprednisolone for acute eosinophilic pneumonia and bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. He is also on vancomycin and gentamicin. The plan is to taper methylprednisolone over the next few weeks to an equivalent of 30 mg prednisone. 

The patient has several potential medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), hypotension, chronic systolic heart failure, anemia, and prostate cancer. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 119/48 to 160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Initial thoughts he may have ""eosinophilic process
   secondary to malignancy.  Differential is still broad and definitive
   diagnosis would require VATS which he may not tolerate.

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   Stable overnight. Exam significant for rhonchorous sounds on right. 2+
   edema. Overall fluid balance 1 liter positive. Leukocytosis improved,
   urine output 20-30 cc/hr with unchanged creatinine at 1.7.
   CXR shows less opacification of right lung, somewhat improved since
   yesterday. Patient continues to be vent dependent, on a/c 350x 28, 10,
   50% O2. Will try to wean FiO2 tonight. Remains sedated on versed and
   fentanyl with ongoing albeit low Levophed requirements.
   TTE is consistent with severe LV dysfunction (EF 25-30%) and moderate
   pulmonary hypertension (TR grad 44). He has shown some improvement over
   past two days with decreased FIO2 and PEEP requirements, and decreased
   Levophed requirement possibly as a result of decreasing the peep.
   Several micro studies are pending including beta-glucan, galactomannan,
   tularemia Ab, histo, strongyloides, and repeat sputum. Remains on Vanc
   and Gent, tapering  Solumedrol (dose will be decreased today to 40mg
   q8h). Tube feeds were initiated.
   Imp - progressive acute respiratory failure of unclear etiology,
   concerning for: AIP, eosinophilic syndrome exacerbated by CHF in the
   setting of shock, less likely malignancy with lymphangitic spread.
   Patient is a never smoker but with years of unprotected exposure to
   metal dust as machinist.
   He also has shock (probably septic and cardiogenic), recurrent SVT,
   acute renal failure likely ATN, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Will
   keep on low-tidal volume A/C 350 x 28, peep 10, FiO2 50%. He remains
   pressor-dependent (Levophed) with goals of keeping MAP>65.
   Prognosis remains guarded. Rest of the plan per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and in respiratory distress. Initial labs revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.2 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T). The patient was started on norepinephrine for hypotension, midazolam for sedation, and fentanyl for pain control. The patient's condition has been stable, with improvements in blood pressure and oxygen saturation. However, the patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may progress to AKI if not addressed promptly.

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on cxr clinical mild improvement.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Initial thoughts he may have ""eosinophilic process
   secondary to malignancy.  Differential is still broad and definitive
   diagnosis would require VATS which he may not tolerate.
   - Will taper methylprednisolone over next few weeks to equivalent of 30
   mg prednisone for Acute eosinophilic PNA  will drop dose to 40mg q8hr.

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing 30% eosinophils. The BAL was otherwise unremarkable. He has been treated with intravenous steroids.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/48 mmHg to 160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 349 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 249 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab values"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening oxygenation. Initial management included aggressive diuresis for pulmonary edema, but his hypoxia worsened, leading to the decision for intubation. CT imaging showed pulmonary edema with more consolidation compared to a prior study. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) findings were unchanged from the prior study.

The patient has several ongoing issues, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypercarbia, diffuse right peripheral infiltrates with eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and a possible diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Additional diagnostic tests are pending, including beta-glucan, galactomannan, histoplasma, tularemia, and mycolitic blood cultures. The patient is being treated with lower-dose steroids and bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.

Other concerns include anemia, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia ("

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), as well as congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%.

2. The patient presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on a chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.

3. The patient is intubated and sedated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Initially, there was a worsening of hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask, and the patient was aggressively diuresed. However, his hypoxia worsened, leading to intubation. A CT scan showed pulmonary edema, which was compared to a prior scan showing more consolidation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remained unchanged from the prior assessment.

4. The patient's hypercarbia has since resolved with decreasing dead space. The goal is to ventilate more efficiently, possibly using ARDSnet ventilation.

5. The patient has diffuse right peripheral infiltrates with BAL showing 30% eosinophils. There is also peripheral eosinophilia, suggesting acute eosinophilic pneumonia. PC"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. The patient presented with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent deterioration while on a non-rebreather mask indicate severe hypoxia. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary to support his respiratory function. The presence of diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray suggests an underlying pulmonary process, which may include pneumonia or acute eosinophilic pneumonia.

2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with hyperkalemia, indicated by an elevated potassium level. Additionally, there is evidence of fluid overload, as suggested by a positive fluid balance and worsening edema. This may be related to his chronic heart failure or recent diuretic use.

3. Hypotension: The patient initially experienced hypotension peri-intubation but continues to require both levophed and vasopressin for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He presents with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), indicating a possible diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS. The patient is responding to treatment, which includes tapering methylprednisolone, continuing vancomycin and gentamicin, and monitoring for Legionella and other pathogens. The patient also has anemia, renal failure, hypotension, and chronic systolic heart failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and is expected to continue with titration of FiO2 as tolerated. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia on BAL suggests acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS. This condition can lead to severe respiratory distress and requires close monitoring and appropriate management.

2. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since [**2-4**], which is slowly trending down. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management of anemia.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's oxygenation has clinically improved. He is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS: The patient's symptoms, including the presence of eosinophils in the BAL and peripheral eosinophilia, suggest this diagnosis. Treatment includes tapering methylprednisolone, continuing vancomycin and gentamicin, and monitoring for improvement.

2. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since [date]. It is slowly trending down but without any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding. Possible causes include hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Further evaluation is needed, including a bone marrow biopsy.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved. There are no signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension worsened by nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing 30% eosinophils. Initial thoughts suggest an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy, but further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDS net ventilation and titrated FiO2 as tolerated. He is also receiving methylprednisolone, Bactrim, Vancomycin, and Gentamicin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Eosinophilic pneumonia: The presence of 30% eosinophils in the BAL suggests an eosinophilic process. If left untreated, this could lead to respiratory distress and failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent this complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. They are currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypotension, hypoxemia, and electrolyte imbalances. They have been receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, sedatives, and other medications to manage their condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they still require close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent and treat this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers may be prescribed to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of intake compared to output, indicating the possibility of fluid overload. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration are crucial to prevent fluid overload and its associated complications.
5. Hypotension: Despite being on vasopressors, the patient's blood pressure remains low. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and adjustment"

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned.

   # Hypercarbia: Has since resolved in setting of decreasing dead space.
   Need to ventilate more efficiently, may be [**12-31**] ARDSnet ventilation
   - decreasing dead space
   - decreasing RR to prevent over-distension
   # Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with
   peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
   mycolytic blood culture negative.
   - histoplasma, tularemia pending
   - cont lower-dose steroids

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He is hypoxic and intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in the left upper extremity, confirmed by ultrasound. Heparin therapy has been initiated.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial presentation was consistent with ARDS, characterized by hypoxia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on imaging. He required mechanical ventilation and diuretics for fluid management.

3. Eosinophilic Pneumonia: The patient's BAL and peripheral eosinophilia suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia. Steroids have been continued to treat this condition.

4. Hypotension: The patient required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure due to hypotension. This may be related to sepsis, diuresis, intubation, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

5. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since February 4th. It is thought to be due to anemia of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the hospital with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening oxygenation despite being on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia, with some improvement after diuresis but subsequent worsening. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed pulmonary edema, and the patient's tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was unchanged from previous assessments. No video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was planned.

The patient has been receiving weaning trials with the goal of maintaining oxygen saturation (SaO2) above 93%, frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, maintaining input/output (I/O) balance, and a slow taper of steroid dosage to avoid adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues:

1. Hypercarbia: This has since resolved with decreasing dead space. The patient may require ARDSnet ventilation to improve ventilation efficiency.

2. Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates: A bronchoal"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef20%, prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned.
   - weaning vent but maintain SaO2 >93%
   - frequent ABGs
   - goal I/O even today
   - continue lower-dose steroids: decrease to 20mg IV solumedrol Q8hrs,
   slow taper to avoid adrenal insufficiency with goal to equivalent 30 mg
   prednisone X 1 (=24 solumedrol)  month
   - cont Vanc / Gent empiric Abx
   - f/u fungal Cx and infectious data
   # Hypercarbia: Has since resolved in setting of decreasing dead space.
   Need to ventilate more efficiently, may be [**12-31**] ARDSnet ventilation
   - decreasing dead space
   - decreasing RR to prevent over-distension
   # Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with
   peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
   mycolytic blood culture negative.
   - histoplasma, tularemia pending
   - cont lower-dose steroids
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids
   # LUE DVT - increased welling L>R, confirmed on U/S [**3-27**] to involve
   axillary and probably brachial veins.
   - heparin gtt
   # anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by
   [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 221**]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5797**] [**Doctor Last Name 5109**] of hematology.  Work up thus far is negative
   for iron/folate/B12 deficient.  Thought possibly from hormone therapy
   for prostate CA.  No evidence of hemolysis on admission. Bone marrow
   biopsy showed anemia of chronic dz, maybe MDS.  Transfused 1unit [**2-24**]
   with good response.
   - daily hct
   - appreciate hematology recs
   - transfuse for HCT <21
   # Hypotension: Improving. CVP 10.  Initially occurred peri-intubation,
   but now continues to require both levophed and vasopression.  [**Month (only) 8**] have
   been [**12-31**] to [**Month (only) 453**] venous return from diuresis, intubation/PEEP and
   sedation; however, CI is borderline at 2.2, may have component of poor
   cardiac output with reduced EF and 10lbs positive for LOS. TTE shows no
   evidence of cardiogenic etiology.
   - wean vasopressors, keep MAP >65
   - keep I/O even
   # VT/ NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD:  has had runs of VT; likely in setting of
   intubation. Had 2 further episodes of SVT [**3-26**], ECG w/ new T-wave
   changes but CEs negative x3.
   - holding metoprolol for hypotension
   - EP aware, will re-consult if becomes persistent
   - keep K and Mg up
   - cardiac monitoring
   - holding BB and ACEi
   # ARF: non-oliguric renal failure with low sodium, Cr max 1.7 was down
   to 1.1 but now back up to 1.7, may be pre-renal with hypotension vs
   ATN. Gent levels appropriate. No muddy brown casts --> not ATN.
   - holding ACEi for hypotension
   - improve perfusion
   - cont to monitor
   # CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischmia on arrival to ICU,
   chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change. [**3-27**] ECG w/ new
   T-wave changes but CEs negative x3.
   -continue atorvastatin
   -continue ASA
   - holding BB and ACEi given hyptension
   #Chronic Systoic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardiomyopathy -
   Echo [**2-3**] with EF of 20%, PCWP >18, 1+ MR, 1+TR.  Appears mildly volume
   overloaded on arrival to the ICU. Now neg 450cc. Repeat TTE unchanged.
   - monitor volume status
   # Hyperkalemia: did receive kayexelate although need to be careful with
   kayexelate in the vassopression, EKG w/o peaked T
   - monitor
   # h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but patient
   reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his symptoms.  He

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated and sedated. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. 

He is currently receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, steroids, and vasopressors. His condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems."

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on BAL.  Clinically
   stable today.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Suspect he may have Acute eosinophilic PNA with ARDS
   and volume overload and is now responding to tx.
   - Will taper methylprednisolone over next few weeks to equivalent of 30
   mg prednisone for Acute eosinophilic PNA  will drop dose to 10 mg q8hr
   and hold at this level.  Goal equivalent of 30mg prednisone per day or
   24 solumedrol Qday.
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's clinical stability today.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens negative, BAL negative for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens. Suspect he may have Acute eosinophilic PNA with ARDS and volume overload, now responding to treatment.
   - Will taper methylprednisolone over next few weeks to equivalent of 30 mg prednisone for Acute eosinophilic PNA. Will drop dose to 10 mg q8hr and hold at this level. Goal equivalent of 30 mg prednisone per day or 24 solumedrol Qday.
   - Bactrim for PCP.
   - Continue Vanc/Gent day #4 (x-rays improved will continue) will check Gent Peak.
   - SSI while on steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and alteration in nutrition. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and prophylactic heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which is a potential complication associated with prolonged immobilization and hypercoagulability.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange.
3. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, which can be exacerbated by electrolyte imbalances and medication side effects.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, and muscle weakness.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory infection and worsening lung function.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which can result"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, chronic systolic heart failure, and previous coronary artery disease who presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), but negative results for bacterial, viral, fungal, and Legionella pathogens. The patient is suspected to have Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP) with ARDS and volume overload. He is responding to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP) with ARDS: The patient's symptoms, such as diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray and profound eosinophilia on BAL, suggest AEP. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and requires close monitoring and management.

2. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left upper extremity DVT. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and requires anticoagulation therapy.

3. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since February 4th, which is slowly trending down. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia and appropriate management.

4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging, along with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). There is clinical improvement in oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and BAL results suggest AEP with ARDS. It is important to continue appropriate treatment and closely monitor the patient's respiratory status.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity: The presence of edema and bruising in the left upper arm raises concern for DVT. Further evaluation with appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate management.

3. Volume overload: The patient appears mildly volume overloaded, as indicated by the estimated fluid balance and signs of fluid accumulation. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and adjustment of fluid intake and output are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since admission, which has been slowly trending down. Further evaluation with additional blood tests and consultation with a hematologist is warranted to determine the underlying cause"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on a chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening oxygenation despite being on a non-rebreather mask. The patient has a subacute course of hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxia, which worsened despite non-rebreather mask therapy. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. ARDS/acute lung injury: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest a possible diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of an upper extremity DVT, which was confirmed by ultrasound and involves the axillary and possibly brachial veins.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia that is slowly trending down but without any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding. Further workup is needed to determine the cause.
5. Warm autoimmune antibodies: The patient has warm autoimmune antibodies, previously without evidence of hemolysis. Further evaluation is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on non-rebreather. The patient's hypoxia worsened despite aggressive diuresis, and he was found to have pulmonary edema on CT. Subsequently, the patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercarbia, diffuse right peripheral infiltrates with eosinophilia, anemia, warm autoimmune antibodies, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), systolic heart failure, hyperkalemia, and prostate cancer with hormonal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This could be due to aspiration or community-acquired infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms and adjusting antibiotic coverage"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's condition has been complex and includes several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxia, which worsened despite aggressive diuresis and eventually required intubation. The CT scan showed pulmonary edema, indicating acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypercarbia: The patient initially had elevated carbon dioxide levels, which have since resolved. However, the patient may require ARDSnet ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Diffuse Right Peripheral Infiltrates: The patient's chest X-ray showed diffuse right peripheral infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed 30% eosinophils, and the patient also has peripheral eosinophilia. This is likely acute eosinophilic pneumonia, especially given the negative results for other pathogens.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated and sedated. The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening despite being on non-rebreather. His hypoxia worsened, and he was intubated. CT appears to show pulmonary edema, as compared to prior imaging that showed more consolidation. TTE is unchanged from prior. After meeting with the family and cardiac surgery, no video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is planned.
Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia has worsened despite non-rebreather and aggressive diuresis, leading to the need for intubation.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient may have developed ARDS due to diffuse right peripheral infiltrates, acute lung injury, and a low respiratory system compliance.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity, confirmed on ultrasound involving axillary and brachial veins.
4. Eosin"

   Total time 40 minutes.
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and chronic heart failure. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, along with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload. His current medications include Lasix, Bactrim, Vancomycin, Gentamicin, pantoprazole, lipitor, aspirin, colace, risse, atrovent, PPI, calcium, ducolax, and methyprednisolone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS: The patient has diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates with eosinophilia on BAL. This could indicate acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which is a rare but potentially severe lung condition.
2. Left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left upper extremity DVT and is currently on heparin IV.
3. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia since February 4th, which is slowly trending down. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.
4. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload, which is responding to treatment. The patient's condition is clinically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on BAL, suggest the possibility of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. This condition can cause respiratory distress and requires prompt management.
2. ARDS: The patient's presentation of ARDS is indicated by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage leading to severe hypoxemia. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left upper extremity DVT. Anticoagulation therapy, preferably with heparin, should be continued to prevent further clot formation and potential pulmonary embolism.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray, along with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient has been stable today and is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS. He is responding to treatment and will continue with Lasix, Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and vancomycin/gentamicin for bacterial coverage. The patient also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), mild ileus, anemia of unknown etiology, acute kidney injury (ARF) that has improved, and chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-30%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia with ARDS: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia with ARDS. This condition can progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Left Upper Extremity DVT: The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not treated"

   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**].

   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
   mycolytic blood culture negative.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. The patient presents with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask. 

The patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs indicate a fever and increased heart rate, which may suggest an infection. The presence of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and other potential sources of infection could contribute to sepsis.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical, with low oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide levels. ARDS is a possibility given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of a DVT in the upper extremity. This could lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and low urine output, which"

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, steroids, and supportive care. He also requires vasopressors and inotropic support due to hypotension and poor cardiac output.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal diffuse right peripheral infiltrates with eosinophils on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other tests, including blood"

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on BAL.  Clinically
   improved today.
   #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Suspect he may have Acute eosinophilic PNA with ARDS
   and volume overload and is now responding to tx.
   - Continues on solumedrol
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]

   -Continue ARDS net ventilation and titrate FIO2 as tolerated will then
   decrease PEEP.  No changes at this time.
   -Will titrate FiO2 today
   -Will consider repeat CT scan next  week to assess for clinical change
   to help with prognosis.
   #?VAP:  New infiltrate yesterday at L base in setting of fever and new
   pressor requirement.  BP, fever curve and WBC all improved today.
     -Continue Vanc/zosyn.  Will hold off on double GNR coverage given
   improvement

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and chronic systolic heart failure. 

The patient presented with dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The clinical improvement today suggests a possible diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload, which is now responding to treatment.

The patient is currently on solumedrol, bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The plan is to continue ARDS net ventilation and titrate FiO2 as tolerated, then decrease PEEP. Repeat CT scan next week will be done to assess for clinical change and help with prognosis.

The patient also has a new infiltrate yesterday at the left base in the setting of fever and new pressor requirement, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to continue vancomycin and Zosyn, hold off on double GNR coverage given the improvement, and follow up with BAL results.

Other issues include left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), mild ileus, and anemia"

   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and chronic anemia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was intubated due to worsening hypoxia and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely secondary to an underlying pulmonary infection or other inflammatory process. This condition can lead to severe respiratory failure and requires prompt management.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a systemic response to infection, which can progress to organ dysfunction and septic shock if not treated promptly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's history of ICD implantation and CHF puts"

   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's current condition suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity: The patient has an increased welling in the left upper extremity, confirmed on ultrasound, involving the axillary and brachial veins. This indicates the presence of a DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not treated appropriately.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray indicate the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure, and prostate cancer. He presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening hypoxia despite being on a non-rebreather mask. 

Initial assessment showed a component of pulmonary edema, and the patient was aggressively diuresed. However, his hypoxia worsened, and he required intubation. A CT scan revealed pulmonary edema, and there were no plans for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The patient also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bronchoscopy showed eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), suggesting acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other infectious workup, including fungal and Legionella, was negative. 

The patient also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity, confirmed by ultrasound. He has anemia that has been present since February 4th, which is being managed by hematology. A bone marrow biopsy showed anemia of chronic disease or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the patient received a blood transfusion with good response.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef 20% prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on BAL.  Clinically
   improved today.
    #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Suspect he may have Acute eosinophilic PNA vs steroid
   unresponsive BOOP with ARDS  and volume overload and is now responding
   to tx.
   - Continues on solumedrol
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids
   -Will try to diurese today as hemodynamics allow.  Goal -1 liter.
   - Histo /tularemia studies pending
   -Continue ARDS net ventilation.
   -Will titrate FiO2 down today.  Some suspicion that sats and PaO2 may
   not correlate so will titrate based on PaO2.
   -Will consider repeat CT scan next  week to assess for clinical change
   to help with prognosis.
    #?VAP:  New infiltrate at L base in setting of fever and new pressor
   requirement.  BP, fever curve and WBC all improved today. BAL
   non-diagnostic.  Despite peripheral appearance, this is unlikely to be
   PE/infarct as he has been on heparin for DVT.
   -Continue Vanc/zosyn.  Will hold off on double GNR coverage given
   improvement
    #Left Upper extremity DVT
   -Continue heparin drip, will transition to coumadin soon.
    #GI-Mild ileus/ residuals on tube feeds
   -Continue stimulant.  Senna/bisacodyl
    #anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by
   [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 221**]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5797**] [**Doctor Last Name 5109**] of hematology.  Work up thus far is negative
   for iron/folate/B12 deficient.  Thought possibly from hormone therapy
   for prostate CA.  No evidence of hemolysis on admission. Bone marrow
   biopsy pending.  Also recent warm agglutins.
   -  hemolysis labs wnl.
   - bone marrow biopsy results unrevealing
   - appreciate hematology recs.
    # ARF: GFR relatively stable.
   -No signs of  ATN
   # CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischemia on arrival to ICU,
   chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
   -continue atorvastatin
   -continue [**Doctor Last Name 119**]
   -Will consider restarting low dose BB if BP is stable, but will hold
   off for now to save BP room for diuresis.
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
    #Chronic Systolic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardio myopathy
   - Echo EF 20%-30% Est PAP increased from prior otherwise unchanged.
   - Diurese as above
   - Holding BB as above.
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
    # h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but
   patient reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his
   symptoms.  He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5798**].
   -tamsulosin will hold
   -prostate CA adeno CA
    # Contact: wife [**Name (NI) **], brother would like to be called on Saturday; [**Name (NI) **]
   (son) is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5848**].
    # Code: No CPR for Hypoxemic arrest discussed with family.

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on BAL.  Clinically
   improved today.
    #Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
   also with peripheral eosinophilia, PCP negative, respiratory viral
   antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial/viral and fungal pathogens.
   Legionella neg. Suspect he may have Acute eosinophilic PNA vs steroid
   unresponsive BOOP with ARDS  and volume overload and is now responding
   to tx.
   - Continues on solumedrol
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids
   -Will try to diurese today as hemodynamics allow.  Goal -1 liter.
   - Histo /tularemia studies pending
   -Continue ARDS net ventilation.
   -Will titrate FiO2 down today.  Some suspicion that sats and PaO2 may
   not correlate so will titrate based on PaO2.
   -Will consider repeat CT scan next  week to assess for clinical change
   to help with prognosis.
    #?VAP:  New infiltrate at L base in setting of fever and new pressor
   requirement.  BP, fever curve and WBC all improved today. BAL
   non-diagnostic.  Despite peripheral appearance, this is unlikely to be
   PE/infarct as he has been on heparin for DVT.
   -Continue Vanc/zosyn.  Will hold off on double GNR coverage given
   improvement
    #Left Upper extremity DVT
   -Continue heparin drip, will transition to coumadin soon.
    #GI-Mild ileus/ residuals on tube feeds
   -Continue stimulant.  Senna/bisacodyl
    #anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by
   [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 221**]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5797**] [**Doctor Last Name 5109**] of hematology.  Work up thus far is negative
   for iron/folate/B12 deficient.  Thought possibly from hormone therapy
   for prostate CA.  No evidence of hemolysis on admission. Bone marrow
   biopsy pending.  Also recent warm agglutins.
   -  hemolysis labs wnl.
   - bone marrow biopsy results unrevealing
   - appreciate hematology recs.
    # ARF: GFR relatively stable.
   -No signs of  ATN
   # CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischemia on arrival to ICU,
   chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
   -continue atorvastatin
   -continue [**Doctor Last Name 119**]
   -Will consider restarting low dose BB if BP is stable, but will hold
   off for now to save BP room for diuresis.
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
    #Chronic Systolic heart failure - likely [**12-31**] ischemic cardio myopathy
   - Echo EF 20%-30% Est PAP increased from prior otherwise unchanged.
   - Diurese as above
   - Holding BB as above.
   - hold ACEI for recent renal failure and contrast
    # h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but
   patient reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his
   symptoms.  He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5798**].
   -tamsulosin will hold

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and chronic systolic heart failure. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging, along with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) or steroid-unresponsive bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload. He is responding to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition may worsen if there is further damage to the lungs, leading to increased difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The presence of new infiltrate at the left base in the setting of fever and new pressor requirement raises suspicion for VAP. If not appropriately managed, it can lead to worsening respiratory status.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has left upper extremity DVT. If left untreated, it can result in pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
4. GI-mild ileus/residuals on tube feeds: The patient has mild ileus with residuals on tube feeds."

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, who presented with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities. He was initially treated for pulmonary edema but subsequently developed hypoxia and required intubation. The patient has a subacute course of hypoxia, with worsening oxygenation despite being on a non-rebreather mask. A CT scan showed pulmonary edema, and there were no signs of infection on Gram stain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has evidence of ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and requires careful management in the ICU.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been intubated for an extended period, he is at risk of developing VAP. It"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, prostate cancer, and chronic anemia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and diffuse right peripheral infiltrates. The patient also has a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypercarbia, acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia of chronic disease (possibly myelodysplastic syndrome), warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypotension, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT/NSVT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and a history of myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p MI/CABG). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedation, and vasoactive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued respiratory failure due to ARDS and VAP.
2. Progression of AKI, possibly leading to renal failure.
3. Development of further thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Hemodynamic instability due to hypotension and the need for vasopressor support.
5. Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and worsening heart failure.
6. Anemia worsening and potential need for transfusions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, ICD placement, and chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. He presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated and sedated. The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening despite being on non-rebreather. He initially had pulmonary edema and was aggressively diuresed, but his hypoxia worsened, leading to intubation. A CT scan showed pulmonary edema, and no VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) was planned. The patient also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and required bronchoscopy. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation with the goal of maintaining SaO2 >93%. Frequent ABGs (arterial blood gases) will be done. Lasix 10mg IV will be given as a bolus now, with a goal of I/O negative 500cc for the day. Lower-dose steroids (20mg IV solumedrol Q8hrs X 5 days) will be continued to avoid adrenal insufficiency. Empiric antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) will be continued, and fungal cultures will be followed up.

2. Hypercarbia: This has since resolved with decreasing dead space. ARDSnet ventilation may be considered to decrease dead space and decrease RR to prevent over-distension.

3. Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates: BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) showed 30% eosinophils, and the patient also had peripheral eosinophilia. The diagnosis is most likely acute eosinophilic pneumonia. PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), respiratory viral antigens, and BAL for bacterial pathogens were negative. Legionella was also negative. Pulmonary consult suggests an eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like non-steroid responsive BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). Beta-glucan and galactomannan were negative, and mycolytic blood culture was negative. Histo negative. 

- Tularemia is pending, and no active treatment for it will be given. Lower-dose steroids will be continued, and Bactrim for PCP will be given while on steroids.

4. VAP pneumonia: Infectious studies are pending, and no microorganisms were seen on gram stain. Empiric Vanc/Zosyn will be continued.

5. UTI: Infectious studies will be followed up, and empiric Vanc/Zosyn will be continued.

6. LUE DVT: Increased welling L>R, confirmed on ultrasound involving axillary and probably brachial"

After meeting with the cardiothoracic surgery team, no video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is planned. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has new fever, with pending infectious studies. His sputum gram stain shows gram-negative rods, gram-positive rods, and yeast. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia that worsened despite non-rebreather and required intubation.
2. VAP: The patient developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are intub"

   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**].

   - cont empiric Vanc / Zosyn
   # Fever: Sources include Urine, lung, blood, sinuses. Most likely VAP,
   although has been on broad coverage for past few days
   - consider adding quinolone for double pseudomonas coverage
   - consider head CT to r/u sinusitis
   - repeat chest CT to evaluate progression of disease
   # Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with
   peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
   mycolytic blood culture negative. Histo negative.

   - decreasing RR to prevent over-distension
   # ARF: Has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] course. Initial increase in creatinine
   felt to be prerenal as urine with no muddy brown casts. However, now,
   he has a new worsening of creatinine

   evidence of cardiogenic etiology.
   - keep I/O even
   # VT/ NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD:  has had runs of VT; likely in setting of
   intubation. Had 2 further episodes of SVT [**3-26**], ECG w/ new T-wave

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure, and prostate cancer. He presented with dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening respiratory failure. The patient's hypoxia has been fluctuating despite being on non-rebreather and receiving aggressive diuresis. His CT scan showed pulmonary edema, and he was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's fever is suspected to be due to VAP, although other potential sources have been ruled out. He has peripheral eosinophilia and diffuse right peripheral infiltrates, most likely indicating acute eosinophilic pneumonia. The patient's hypercarbia has resolved, and he may require ARDSnet ventilation. He has acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine, and further evaluation is needed. The patient is also anemic with a possible diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. The patient was admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing eosinophils at 30%. He has been febrile and on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have not improved his condition. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent fever, hypotension, and hypoxemia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results indicate elevated eosinophils, elevated lactate levels, and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates, profound eosinophilia on BAL, and respiratory distress suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung injury and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, and negative cultures indicate a possible ongoing infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and worsening renal function suggest the development of AKI. This can be caused by various factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and neph"

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   Stable overnight but spiked fever to 102.7, pancultured. Creatinine
   increased now to 2.0 without obvious cause, peripheral eos at 12%.
   Urine was spun and shows granular casts. FiO2 and peep increased over
   weekend, CXR shows worsening infiltrates. Exam unchanged. Clear breath
   sounds ant/lat, UE edema, abd soft, BS present.
   Overall fluid balance ~ even. Leukocytosis improving to 11.5,
   creatinine now at 2.0. BAL gram stain shows no organisms. Cultures
   pending. No other new micro data.
   TTE [**3-24**] showed severe LV dysfunction (EF 25-30%) and moderate
   pulmonary hypertension (TR grad 44).
   Several micro studies are pending including Asperg galactomannan,
   tularemia Ab, strongyloides. Remains on Vanc and Gent, Solumedrol.
   Getting tube feeds.
   IMP/PLAN
   Progressive acute respiratory failure of unclear etiology, concerning
   for: eosinophilic syndrome exacerbated by CHF in the setting of shock
   and SVT, AIP, less likely malignancy with lymphangitic spread however
   sputum cytology shows atypical squamous cells and abundant neutrophils.
   There is now peripheral eosinophilia and fever. Agree with resiting the
   CVL and giving pulsed-dose Solumedrol. Continue IV heparin for upper
   extremity DVT.
   Other issues include recurrent SVT, improving acute renal failure
   likely ATN, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, hx of prostate ca. We will
   plan on a family meeting for tomorrow.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with a dry cough and is found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is clinically stable today.

The assessment and plan include diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates with 30% eosinophils in BAL, peripheral eosinophilia, negative results for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), respiratory viral antigens, and fungal pathogens. Legionella is also negative. The patient will receive pulse therapy and continue on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will be given once all cultures are final and negative. The central line will be changed, and ARDS net ventilation will be continued with titration of FiO2 as tolerated.

The patient's fevers remain unclear with a broad spectrum of antibiotics being administered. The differential includes inflammatory with elevated eos, infectious, malignancy, versus drug reaction. The line will be changed, and the current antibiotics will be continued until cultures are final. Pulse dose steroids will be given due to clinical deterioration with a taper and negative bronchus.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, renal failure, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture (blowout, Le Fort), and pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. He has been hypotensive and required transfusion of packed red blood cells. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures have been negative. Imaging shows worsening of pre-existing opacity in the left lung and slight improvement of abnormalities in the right upper lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's current condition indicates worsening of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by difficulty breathing, low oxygen levels, and lung infiltrates. The patient requires close monitoring and management of respiratory support.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's blood cultures and urine cultures have been negative, the presence of fever and hypotension suggests ongoing infection and potential sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection source are crucial.

3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity. Close monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism or extension of the DVT is necessary. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued as prescribed.

   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**] w/o infectious results. New Sputum gram stain with
   GNRs, GPRs, yeast. Galactomannan, Tularemia, Strongyloides, and IgE
   still pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, chronic heart failure with ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- He presented with dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest imaging.
- He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated and sedated.
- Initial diagnosis included pulmonary edema, but subsequent imaging showed worsening of the lung condition with extensive areas of ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and bronchiectasis in the left lung.
- The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and other medications for various conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity, anemia, warm autoimmune antibodies, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and sick sinus syndrome.
- His current vitals include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/52 to 135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.
- Laboratory tests show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal diffuse extensive areas of ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and bronchiectasis in the left lung, with slight improvement in the right upper lobe.
- The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory distress and multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. This condition is characterized by a new or progressive lung infection that occurs more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction. AKI can occur due to various factors such as hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and his immobilization and decreased mobility due to being in the ICU may increase the risk of further clot formation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest a systemic inflammatory response, which could be indicative of sepsis. This is further supported by the presence of warm autoimmune antibodies and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has been intubated and sedated. The patient has had a subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening despite being on non-rebreather. His hypoxia worsened, and he was intubated. A CT scan showed pulmonary edema, as compared to prior scans that showed more consolidation. TTE was unchanged from prior. After meeting with the family and cardiac surgery, no video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was planned. The patient also has VAP pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity, anemia, warm autoimmune antibody, hypotension, and ventricular tachycardia (VT)/supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), among other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. VAP: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can progress to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Eosinophilic pneumonia: The patient"

","Summary:
Mr. [Last Name] is an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG/ICD, CHF ejection fraction 20%, prostate cancer, presenting with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest CT. The patient's hypoxia worsened and he was intubated. Repeat CT chest showed worsening progression of disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 70% and PEEP 15 cmH2O. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis with neutrophilia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated BUN and creatinine, elevated liver enzymes, and eosinophilia. Blood cultures are pending. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and pulse-dose steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status, diffuse opacities on chest CT, and need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and presence of fever, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN)"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on imaging. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequent intubation due to worsening respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple issues including renal failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte/fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory failure and worsening opacities on imaging suggest a high risk for ARDS. It is important to closely monitor oxygenation and ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive sputum gram stain indicate a potential infectious process. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and source control are necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and muddy brown casts suggest acute tubular necrosis. Ensuring adequate renal perfusion, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and monitoring fluid balance are crucial.
4. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient's increased welling in the left upper extremity and confirmed involvement of the axillary and brachial veins on ultrasound indicate a DVT. Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated and transitioned to warfarin once stable.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may require further evaluation, especially considering the bone marrow biopsy showing anemia of chronic disease or possible myelodysplastic syndrome.
6. Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: The presence of warm autoantibodies may lead to hemolysis. Monitoring for signs of anemia and hemolysis is essential.
7. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful management of fluid balance, vasoactive medications, and ongoing assessment of cardiac function.
8. VT/NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD: The patient has experienced ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiac monitoring and consulting electrophysiologist are necessary.
9. CAD s/p MI/CABG: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered when evaluating cardiac symptoms and EKG changes.
10. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's reduced ejection fraction and evidence of volume overload indicate chronic systolic heart failure. Ongoing monitoring of fluid status and cardiac function is important.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current critical condition require close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5795**] is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef20%, prostate ca
   who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse right sided patchy
   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: Now intubated and sedated.  Patient has had a
   subacute course of hypoxia with some worsening with PoA2 58 despite on
   non-rebreather. Initially, it was felt there was a component of pulm
   edema and he was aggressively diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was
   intubated. CT appears to have pulmonary edema, as compared to prior
   that showed more consolidation. TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting
   w/ family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with VAP as well,
   bronched again [**3-28**] w/o infectious results. New Sputum gram stain with
   GNRs, GPRs, yeast. Galactomannan, Tularemia, Strongyloides, and IgE
   still pending.

","Summary:
Mr. [Known lastname 5795] is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening hypoxia. Initial diagnosis included pulmonary edema and pneumonia, but subsequent tests and imaging ruled out these conditions. Subsequent investigations revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and bronchiectasis in the left lung, with slight improvement in the right upper lobe. Blood cultures were negative, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 30% eosinophils. The patient also has peripheral eosinophilia and is most likely suffering from acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Other findings include renal failure, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity, and anemia of chronic disease with possible myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including hypercarbia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia ("

   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: No improvement and worsening O2 requriement.
   Repeat CT chest with worsening  progression of disease.Initially, it
   was felt there was a component of pulm edema and he was aggressively
   diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was intubated. CT appears to have
   pulmonary edema, as compared to prior that showed more consolidation.
   TTE unchanged from prior. After meeting w/ family and CT Surgery, no
   VATS planned. Now with VAP as well, bronched again [**3-28**] w/o infectious
   results. New Sputum gram stain with GNRs, GPRs, yeast. Galactomannan,
   Tularemia, Strongyloides, and IgE still pending. - continue to wean

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. He presents with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and intubated due to worsening oxygen requirements. His condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sepsis, and pneumonia. The patient has a history of prostate cancer and is receiving hormonal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory condition and diffuse opacities on CT chest suggest ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been declining, as indicated by increasing creatinine levels and muddy brown casts suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This can be due to various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity, confirmed by ultrasound. This increases the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He also has peripheral eosinophilia, but tests for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens were negative. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there are concerns about overdistension of the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is already experiencing ARDS, which can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid balance are crucial.

2. Overdistension of the lungs: The patient's high peak pressures and plateau pressures indicate the possibility of overdistension, which can further damage the lungs and worsen respiratory function. Adjustments in ventilator settings may be necessary to prevent this complication.

3. Hypotension: The patient required levophed to manage hypotension overnight, suggesting potential issues with blood pressure regulation. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support are essential.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function and elevated creatinine levels suggest the development of AKI."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prostate cancer, who presented with a dry cough. He has been admitted with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient has been clinically stable today. The assessment includes diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates, BAL negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, and peripheral eosinophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates: This indicates the presence of inflammation or infection in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.
2. Profound eosinophilia on BAL: Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that typically increase in response to allergic reactions or parasitic infections. The presence of eosinophils in the BAL suggests an allergic or parasitic cause for the pulmonary infiltrates.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 93%, indicating reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This can be caused by the pulmonary infiltrates and impaired gas exchange.
4. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
5. Left Upper extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a blood clot in the veins of the left upper extremity. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and can lead"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presented with a dry cough and was found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently critically ill in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates with eosinophilia on BAL: This suggests the possibility of an eosinophilic pneumonia or an allergic reaction, which can lead to respiratory distress and further deterioration of lung function.

2. Fevers with unclear etiology: The presence of fever could indicate an ongoing infection, possibly secondary to the patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection remains unclear.

3. Left Upper extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is already on a heparin drip for this condition, which indicates a risk of thromboembolic events. Further monitoring and anticoagulation therapy will be necessary.

4. GI-Mild ileus/residuals on tube feeds: The patient may have some issues with gastrointestinal motility, resulting in"

These include renal failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and other issues.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate 67 bpm (64-84 bpm), blood pressure 114/52 mmHg (73-135/40-63 mmHg), respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute (24-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 93%.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including heparin sodium, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and midazolam. They are also on various medications and have undergone arterial and multi-lumen lines for monitoring and treatment purposes.

The patient's lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or other systems. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal"

   peripheral opacities on [**Hospital 2667**] transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
   #Hypoxic Resp Failure: No improvement and worsening O2 requriement.
   Repeat CT chest with worsening  progression of disease. Initially, it
   was felt there was a component of pulm edema and he was aggressively
   diuresed. His hypoxia worsened and he was intubated.. After meeting w/
   family and CT Surgery, no VATS planned. Now with possible VAP, bronched
   again [**3-28**] w/o infectious results. Sputum culter ultimately with sparse
   orpharyngeal flora. Galactomannan, Tularemia, Strongyloides, and IgE
   still pending. Respiratory failure seems to be progressing further.
   - continue to attempt weaning vent tolerating PaO2 70-80 or SaO2 >93%

   # Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils, also with
   peripheral eosinophilia most likely [**12-31**] acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   PCP negative, respiratory viral antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial
   pathogens. Legionella neg. Per pulmonary consult, he may have
   ""eosinophilic process secondary to malignancy or something like a
   non-steroid responsive BOOP"". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
   mycolytic blood culture negative. Histo negative. Chest CT worse.
   - tularemia pending, not actively treating for it anymore
   - cont  pulse-dose as above
   - bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1992**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids
   # Hypercarbia: Has since resolved in setting of decreasing dead space.
   Need to ventilate more efficiently, may be [**12-31**] ARDSnet ventilation
   - decreasing dead space
   - decreasing RR to prevent over-distension
   # Fever: Last  temp 24 hrs ago, only low grade since then, fever curve
   trending down.  Sources include Urine, lung, blood, sinuses. Most
   likely VAP, although has been on broad coverage for past few days. Diff
   on CBC today w/ 12% Eos. New Sputum gram stain with GNRs, GPRs, yeast.
   Alternatives: CVL, sinuses, GB, stool, effusion. CVL changed, tip

   - goals of care: talk to family about turning off AICD
   # ARF: Has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] course, now worseing, with muddy brown
   casts suggestive of ATN.
   - holding ACEi for hypotension
   - improve perfusion
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE DVT - increased welling L>R, confirmed on U/S [**3-27**] to involve
   axillary and probably brachial veins.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - will need to transition to coumadin once stable and no need for
   further procedures
   # Anemia: has been present since [**2-4**], slowly trending down but without
   any acute drops and no evidence of bleeding.  He has been followed by

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. He presents with dry cough and is found to have diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He is transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition worsens despite aggressive diuresis, and he is intubated. A repeat CT scan shows worsening progression of disease. The patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and his sputum culture reveals growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs), Gram-positive rods (GPRs), and yeast. The patient's eosinophil count is elevated, and he is diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. He also has anemia of chronic disease and possibly myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient's warm autoimmune antibody is positive. He experiences hypotension, which is improving, and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10. He requires both levophed and vasopressin for blood pressure support. The patient's cardiac output is borderline, and there is a possibility of poor cardiac output due to reduced ejection fraction. His TTE shows no evidence of cardiogenic etiology."

   # Fever: Last  temp 48 hrs ago, only low grade since then, fever curve
   trending down.  Sources include Urine, lung, blood, sinuses. Most
   likely VAP, although has been on broad coverage for past few days. Diff

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and chronic systolic heart failure likely due to ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on the chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and developed respiratory failure, which has not improved despite aggressive management. The patient also has renal failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia.

The patient's condition is worsening, with ongoing respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction. There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute eosinophilic pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Additionally, the patient's cardiac status is a concern, with evidence of systolic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. The patient's complex medical history and current clinical presentation pose significant challenges in managing his critical"

The patient initially presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and subsequently intubated due to worsening respiratory failure. His condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including renal failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and hypoxemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has also experienced episodes of hypercarbia, fever, anemia, warm autoimmune antibodies, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block.

The patient's current treatment plan includes weaning off the ventilator, maintaining adequate fluid and electrolyte balance, managing pain and discomfort, administering antibiotics, and providing nutritional support. His code status is do not resuscitate (D"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, prostate cancer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity. He presented with dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest X-ray. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and initially suspected to have pulmonary edema, but his condition worsened, leading to intubation. Subsequently, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), eosinophilic pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He also had anemia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and a warm autoimmune antibody. His cardiac status showed no evidence of cardiogenic etiology, and he had a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and is receiving hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, characterized by diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities on chest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of renal failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, facial/orbital fracture, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pneumonia, hypoxemia, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which can lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response, which can increase the risk of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure can contribute to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, or hemorrhage.
4. Facial/Orbital Fracture: The presence of facial/orbital fracture increases the risk of complications such as respiratory distress, facial infections, and disfigurement.
5. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction poses a risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock, leading to organ failure and mortality.
6. Deep Veinous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's DVT in the upper extremity"

   Addendum: family has decided together on withdrawal of care. They
   requested his ICD be shut off (rather than magnet) and that he be
   extubated rather than be kept on ventilator. We will ensure comfort at
   all times. Autopsy has been requested.
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and prostate cancer. He presents with a dry cough and diffuse right-sided patchy peripheral opacities with profound eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 70%. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but his condition has not improved. The patient also has peripheral eosinophilia and negative tests for common pathogens. He is being treated with pulse steroids and bactrim for possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening oxygenation and the presence of diffuse right and left peripheral infiltrates suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of recent immobilization and is on heparin therapy, which may indicate a DVT.
3. GI Mild ileus: The patient has mild ileus with residuals on tube feeds, suggesting possible gastrointestinal issues.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, but further investigation may be required to determine the cause.
