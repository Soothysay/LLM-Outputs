","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a productive cough and fever. They were admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen central venous catheter start, requiring BIPAP for a few hours, and non-rebreather mask. The patient also had difficulty with arterial line placement and obtaining ABGs. They have a history of allergies to aspirin and anaphylaxis. The patient required levophed support for blood pressure during the transfer from the ER to the ICU. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/47-118/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,407 mL and a total output of 1,200 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg. The patient is receiving high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery, CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a tidal volume of 1,884 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

   - consider atypical causes of PNA including CMV, Chlamydia, EBV, HSV
   - f/u HIV results
   - TB in differential though less likely given diffuse infiltrate and no
   hempotysis
   - consider ID consult if not improving and/or switching coverage to
   vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Sepsis
  Patient with increased pressor requirements in the setting;
   now awaiting isolation of  bacteria for formal septic shock.
   - Central venous line - RIJ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented to the hospital with cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's condition is severe, and he requires intensive care unit (ICU) support. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. His vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure requiring vasopressors and elevated heart rate. The patient also has a fever and bibasal crackles on lung examination. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's medical team is considering atypical causes of pneumonia, including CMV, Chlamydia, EBV, HSV, and tuberculosis. They are also evaluating the possibility of hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's current medications include BIPAP, non-rebreather mask, levophed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His code status is full code, and he is being dispositioned to the ICU until he can be extubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient may progress to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for an unknown reason. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and anaphylaxis. The patient received antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and vancomycin) between 08/09/2109 and 08/10/2109. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing a fever of 103.4°F since 08/09/2109 at 02:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobile and at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is in the ICU, which can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and potential medication use.
4. Fever: The patient has had a persistent high fever since 08/09/2109, indicating an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential inadequate tissue perfusion.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, indicating potential impaired glucose control.

   -intubate today
   - consider atypical causes of PNA including CMV, Chlamydia, EBV, HSV
   - f/u HIV results
   - TB in differential though less likely given diffuse infiltrate and no
   hempotysis
   - consider ID consult if not improving and/or switching coverage to
   vanc/zosyn/doxycycline
   # Sepsis
  Patient with increased pressor requirements in the setting;
   now awaiting isolation of  bacteria for formal septic shock.
   - Central venous line - RIJ
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics - vanc, azithro, ceftriaxone
   - Follow-up blood and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - am lactate
   - f/u blood cx from OSH
   .
   Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED.  Could be dilutional given
   copious fluids and decreased po intake for last few days, however,
   cannot rule out hemolysis or DIC
   - repeat HCT
   - hemolysis labs
   - DIC labs
   .
   Hypotension patient requiring levophed for now. We will start
   resusitation.
   - cont IVFs
   - monitor CVP
   - continue broad spectrum antibx

","Summary:
- The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
- He presented with hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and a chest X-ray showing bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates.
- He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's vital signs indicate fever, low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
- Further investigations include blood and sputum cultures, ABG analysis, and tests for atypical pathogens such as Legionella and Mycoplasma.
- The patient requires continued aggressive management with IV fluids, pressors, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to bilateral patchy infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and increased pressor requirements suggest sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing resuscitation and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP).
4. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who recently traveled to [Country 5083] and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He presented with hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is now requiring increasing FiO2 and PEEP for adequate oxygenation, suggesting the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation using a low tidal volume and high PEEP strategy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which is now likely complicated by ARDS. The patient requires increasing levels of FiO2 and PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory status and the need for higher PEEP levels suggest the development of ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange.
3. Sepsis: The patient's presentation is also consistent with sepsis, as indicated by fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, covering various possible pathogens including Legionella and Mycoplasma.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is evidence of hypotension. Pressors may be considered"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath. He was transferred to the hospital from OSH and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia, likely associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient requires increasing FiO2 and PEEP for adequate oxygenation.

The plan is to optimize management by using a low tidal volume, high PEEP strategy to recruit as many small alveoli as possible. A balloon distal esophagus will be used to measure pressure today and then optimize PEEP based on this. The target saturation goal is 88-90%, and the PaO2 goal is >55.

The patient is also showing signs of sepsis with evidence of ARDS. His urine output has improved overnight, and lactate levels are within normal range, indicating no evidence of end organ ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure
With  increasing FiO2 and PEEP overnight concern
   for barotrauma. Multiple recruitment maneuvers attempted however
   benefits were short lived. Diuresis with 10mg IV lasix had good reponse
   with increase UOP however oxygen saturations did not improve
   significantly as expected. Bronchodilator/nebulizers also had no
   effect. Esophageal balloon manometry shows there is room to move up on
   PEEP.  Saturation goal will remain 88-90%, PaO2 goal > 55
   -maintain PEEP of 22 for now until bronchoscopy in the AM will send off
   for cytology and infectious exams.
   -hold tube feeds for now pending bronchoscopy
   -if tolerates
   # ARDS
  CXR last night during hypoxemia on vent showed worsening
   bilateral patchy infiltrates. With increasing requirements of FIO2 and
   PEEP the decision was made to paralyze and decrease oxygen demand. The
   patient
s ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He presented with cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. The patient's chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. He required increasing FiO2 and PEEP, leading to concerns about barotrauma. Esophageal balloon manometry showed room for increasing PEEP. The patient's ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis. He has been paralyzed to decrease oxygen demand. The plan includes maintaining PEEP at 22, holding tube feeds pending bronchoscopy, and sending off for cytology and infectious exams. The patient is also diagnosed with ARDS and will be followed up for potential candidates for activated protein C administration. Other assessments and plans include central venous line, arterial line, IV fluids, blood cultures, WBC count fever curve, hematocrit drop, and nutrition. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU until extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Barotrauma: The patient's increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements raise concerns for barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate adjustments in ventilator settings are crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung hygiene, proper"

s ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis.
   Lactate of 1.0 is reassuring in setting of low urine output. Arterial
   line was placed showing BP 130s/80s. Patient is currently on levophed
   for hypotension this AM. Will follow-up BAL and send for cytology and
   infection work-up, which may yield more information than previous
   bronch and sputum culture. In setting of sepsis, will also check
   cortisoll, ACE and lactate [**Hospital1 **]. In light of the unclear etiology of
   this process, would also consider a work-up of rheumatological
   processes that could predispose to severe pulmonary infections (ie.
   Sarcoid). Will continue to seek consult from infectious disease and
   appreciate recommendations. Also, patient does not meet APACHE II
   criteria for APC.
   - check cortisol, ACE, lactate [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider d/c vancomycin per ID recommendations as low likelihood of
   staph infection
   -f/u BAL for cultures
   -add caspofungin for fungal coverage

The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant medical history, who presented to the hospital with hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath. He was transferred from OSH and diagnosed with bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on a chest X-ray. The patient has been mechanically ventilated with increasing FiO2 and PEEP, but there is concern for barotrauma. Esophageal balloon manometry shows room to move up on PEEP.

The patient's WBC count has increased from 11.7 to 16.1, indicating a possible infection. There is worsening bilateral patchy infiltrates on the CXR, and bronchoscopy is planned in the morning for cytology and infectious exams. The patient's Hct has dropped from 46.6 at OSH to 36 now, likely due to dilutional effects from copious fluids and decreased PO intake. Hemolysis labs will be followed daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure
bilateral patchy infiltrates in CXR suggestive
   of pnueumonia now likely with ARDs now requiring increasing FiO2 and
   PEEP overnight for adequate oxygenation.
   - want to avoid volume trauma but also recruit as many small alveoli as
   possible
to optimize management up to this point have used strategies
   of low tidal volume, high PEEP strategy, however has now been requiring
   higher levels of PEEP
   - plan to drop balloon down esophagus to measure pressure today and
   then optimize PEEP based on this
   - sat goal 88-90%, PaO2 goal > 55
   - [**Male First Name (un) **]
t need to paralyze right now as not overbreathing the ventilator,
   consider paralysis if changes
   - patient on broad spectru antibiotic coverage as per ID
 gentamicin,
   levofloxacin, vanco, ceftriaxone
   - urine legionella negative, mycoplasma serolgies pending
   - sputum culture with 3+ small gram negative coccibacillus
   - intubated yesterday electively
   - HIV negative
   - ruling patient out for TB right now
   - follow up ID recs
   # Sepsis
  now evidence of ARDs as above.
   - better urine output overnight, lactate acid 0.7 so no evidence of end
   organ ischemia which is reassuring
   - will consider starting pressors if lactate rise or if urine output
   drops (use levo or neo if need to start pressors)
   - cortisol 23.6 yesterday, so may use hydrocortisone IV for dropping
   pressure
   - consider activated protein C administration today
 will follow-up
   whether patient is appropriate candidiate
   - Central venous line
 RIJ, working well
   - a-line attempted bilaterally yesterday, worked okay for a little
   while but then tracing was poor
   - if needs a-line will have to have femoral line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics as above
   - blood cultures no growth to date, will continue to follow
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - f/u blood cx from OSH (see ID note)
 no growth to date

   Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 30.  likely dilutional
   in the context of copious fluids and decreased po intake for last few

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Mechanical ventilation
With increasing FiO2 and PEEP overnight
   concern for barotrauma. Multiple recruitment maneuvers attempted
   however benefits were short lived. Diuresis with 10mg IV lasix had good
   reponse with increase UOP however oxygen saturations did not improve
   significantly as expected. Bronchodilator/nebulizers also had no
   effect. Esophageal balloon manometry shows there is room to move up on
   PEEP.  Saturation goal will remain 88-90%, PaO2 goal > 55
   -maintain PEEP of 22 for now until bronchoscopy in the AM will send off
   for cytology and infectious exams.
   -hold tube feeds for now pending bronchoscopy
   -if tolerates can attempt to come down on PEEP and monitor PaO2
   -if patient decompensates, continue levophed, attempt pronation, NO
   # ARDS
 CXR last night during hypoxemia on vent showed worsening
   bilateral patchy infiltrates. With increasing requirements of FIO2 and
   PEEP the decision was made to paralyze and decrease oxygen demand. The
   patient
s ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis.
   Lactate of 1.0 is reassuring in setting of low urine output. Arterial
   line was placed showing BP 130s/80s. Patient is currently on levophed
   for hypotension this AM. Will follow-up BAL and send for cytology and
   infection work-up, which may yield more information than previous
   bronch and sputum culture. In setting of sepsis, will also check
   cortisoll, ACE and lactate [**Hospital1 **]. In light of the unclear etiology of
   this process, would also consider a work-up of rheumatological
   processes that could predispose to severe pulmonary infections (ie.
   Sarcoid). Will continue to seek consult from infectious disease and
   appreciate recommendations. Also, patient does not meet APACHE II
   criteria for APC.
   - check cortisol, ACE, lactate [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider d/c vancomycin per ID recommendations as low likelihood of
   staph infection
   -f/u BAL for cultures
   -add caspofungin for fungal coverage
   -if hypotension continues consider hydrocortisone, also steroids would
   cover for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] get RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - blood cultures no growth to date, will continue to follow

   - f/u blood cx from OSH (see ID note)

   Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 30.  likely dilutional
   in the context of copious fluids and decreased po intake for last few
   days. Follow hemolysis labs daily.
   -          check hemolysis labs, DIC labs
   -          guaiac stools
   # Coagulopathy: Patient noted to have elevated coagulation factors, low
   albumin. Consider liver abnormality, even in setting of low LFTs.
   -consider RUQ US
   -vitamin K x 1 dose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with increasing FiO2 and PEEP, which has led to concern for barotrauma. Diuretics and bronchodilators have been used without significant improvement in oxygen saturation.
- The patient's ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis. An arterial line was placed, and the patient is currently on levophed for hypotension.
- The patient's lactate level is reassuring at 1.0, indicating good tissue perfusion. Lactate levels will be trended and checked, along with cortisol, ACE, and other relevant labs.
- The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth to date, and they will be followed up with blood cultures from OSH (see ID note).
- The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 46.6 at OSH to 36 in the ED, and now to 30. This is likely due to dilutional effects from copious fluids and decreased oral intake.
- The patient's coagulation factors are elevated, while albumin levels are low. This may indicate liver abnormality, even in the setting"

   Lactate 7 PM 1.4
   Patient switched to prone position and O2 requireiements improved.
   Originally started on salumedrol for low cortisol; then pt was bronqued
   and high eosinophils so steroids were increased to high dose.
   Discussed with ID, and they recommended give amphotericin instead of
   capso due to the only exposure he may have got was histoplasma. ID
   fellow recommended stopping vancomycin and recommended doing O&P in BAL
   to r/o parasitic infection.
   If pt supine goal O2sat 88-90; can increase PEEP.

   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements imprioved with pronint
   and treatment so far. Follow up all pending labs to help rule out
   vasculitis, etc.
   -          decrease further PO2
   -          If FiO2 down may try to go slowly on PEEP (from 18 to 17,
   etc).
   -          Reposition tube 2cm down
   -          Continue pronation for now
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.

   Patient switched to prone position and O2 requireiements improved.
   Originally started on salumedrol for low cortisol; then pt was bronqued
   and high eosinophils so steroids were increased to high dose.
   Discussed with ID, and they recommended give amphotericin instead of
   capso due to the only exposure he may have got was histoplasma. ID
   fellow recommended stopping vancomycin and recommended doing O&P in BAL
   to r/o parasitic infection.
   If pt supine goal O2sat 88-90; can increase PEEP.
   Vitamin K for high INR.

   Assessment and Plan
   1)Acute Respiratory Failure:  Bronchoscopy yesterday revealed
   eosinophils and thus acute eosinophilic pneumonia is high on the
   differential
 receiving steroids and improving.  Other considerations
   such as histoplasmosis and parasites could cause eosinophilia and
   respiratory failure.  In addition, since the initial bronchoscopy
   revealed only 8% of eosinophils, it is possible that this new finding
   is just reflective of allergy to one of the many medications given to
   the patient.  Thus, will continue work-up for other causes including
   Goodpasture, Wegner and all infectious possibilities.  I consider AEP
   to be the most likely diagnosis at this time and will continue to treat
   with solumedrol.
   2) Shock: currently blood pressure is improving
   3) Anemia:
   4) Adrenal Insufficiency: re-check cortisol levels from days preceding
   level of 3.5
   5) Coagulopathy: stable
   6) FEN: Tube feeds
 advance slowly as taking down the paralysis

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and paralyzed, and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing improved oxygenation overnight. The patient has a fever of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit and has been receiving multiple antibiotics since August 11th. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the inability to breathe on his own. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of 282 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level of 164 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 106 mEq/L, glucose level of 164 mg/dL, and eosinophil count of 33.0%. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and paralyzed, with chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates. The patient is unresponsive neurologically, warm to the touch, and has normal heart sounds. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia based on bronchoscopy findings of eosinophils. The patient is receiving steroids and showing improvement.
2) Shock: The patient's blood pressure is improving.
3) Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 11.6 g/dL.
4) Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels should be rechecked from days preceding level 3.5.
5) Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters are stable.
6) FEN (Feeding): Tube feeds will be advanced slowly as the patient's paralysis resolves.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
- worsening respiratory failure due to underlying causes such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia, histoplasmosis, or parasitic infection.
- development of further infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
- progression of shock and hypotension.
- worsening anemia and potential need for blood transfusion.
- adrenal insufficiency and its associated complications if the patient's cortisol levels are found to be low.
- coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications.
- complications related to long-term tube feeding, such as aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements imprioved with pronint
   and treatment so far. Follow up all pending labs to help rule out
   vasculitis, etc.
   -          decrease further PO2
   -          If FiO2 down may try to go slowly on PEEP (from 18 to 17,
   etc).
   -          Reposition tube 2cm down
   -          Continue pronation for now
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath. A chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. The patient was initially suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact etiology. The patient has been started on steroids and antibiotics for treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing oxygen requirements. There is a need to monitor and adjust ventilator settings to optimize oxygenation while minimizing barotrauma.
2. Hematocrit drop: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 46.6 at OSH to 36 in the ED and now 33. This could be due to dilutional causes, but further evaluation is needed to rule out hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated coagulation factors and low albumin, which may indicate liver abnormality. Monitoring of coagulation status through INR is necessary, and vitamin K supplementation should be considered.
4. Fluid balance: Care should be taken not to overload the lungs with IV fluids, while repleting electrolytes as needed.
5. Access: The patient has three access sites, including an internal jugular line, two peripheral lines, and an arterial line.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements imprioved with pronint
   and treatment so far. Follow up all pending labs to help rule out
   vasculitis, etc.
   -          decrease further PO2
   -          If FiO2 down may try to go slowly on PEEP (from 18 to 17,
   etc).
   -          Reposition tube 2cm down
   -          Continue pronation for now
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.
   -          Continue steroids
   .
   # Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 33. Most likely

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, except for recent travel to [Country 5083]. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath, along with diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with steroids for acute eosinophilic pneumonia and antibiotics for suspected infections. His oxygen requirements have improved with pronation and treatment. The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 46.6 at OSH to 36 in the ED and now 33, likely due to dilutional causes. There are concerns about a coagulopathy, as the patient has elevated coagulation factors and low albumin. Liver abnormalities are also being considered, despite low liver function test results. The patient's coagulation profile is being monitored, and vitamin K has been administered. Fluid management is crucial to avoid lung overload, and electrolyte levels are being repleted. The patient is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements have improved since
   patient was proned, and is now off paralytics, on sedation. Also high
   on the differential at this point, given ? Freidrich-Waterhouse
   syndrome and low cortisol levels, are Neisseria, fungal infection. In
   terms of autoimmune etiology thus far ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and RF are negative.
   Pending labs include ACE, anti-GBM, Chlamydia, leptospira, mycoplasma,
   HIV viral load.
   -          decrease PEEP as tolerated
   -          f/u cultures and pending labs, f/u with OSH cultures
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.
   -          Continue steroids
   # Adrenal insufficienty: likely [**1-5**] adrenal infarct. Continue steroids
   as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS involvement.
   -methylprednisolone
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 33. Most likely
   dilutional in the setting of negative hemolysis/DIC labs x2.
   -          guaiac stools
   -          f/u HCT
   -          check UA, hemolysis labs
   -          if continues would transfuse hct <25
   # Coagulopathy: Patient noted to have elevated coagulation factors, low
   albumin. Consider liver abnormality, even in setting of low LFTs. If
   coagulopathy, albumin does not resolve consider US RUQ.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was transferred to the hospital for hypoxia in the setting of cough, shortness of breath, and a chest X-ray showing bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to an unclear etiology, possibly acute eosinophilic pneumonia, drug pneumonitis, vasculitis, or Loefler syndrome. He is being treated with steroids and antibiotics. Oxygen requirements have improved since the patient was prone, and he is now off paralytics but on sedation. There are pending labs including ACE, anti-GBM, Chlamydia, leptospira, mycoplasma, and HIV viral load. The patient also has adrenal insufficiency likely due to an adrenal infarct, a drop in hematocrit from 46.6 to 33, coagulopathy with elevated coagulation factors and low albumin, and liver abnormalities. He is on IV fluids, TF started, and prophylactic medications. The patient's code status is full code, and he is dispositioned to the ICU until extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if the underlying cause is not identified and treated effectively.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may lead to further complications if not managed appropriately with steroid replacement."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements have improved since
   patient was proned, and is now off paralytics, on sedation. Also high
   on the differential at this point, given ? Freidrich-Waterhouse
   syndrome and low cortisol levels, are Neisseria, fungal infection.
   -          decrease PEEP as tolerated
   -          f/u cultures and pending labs, f/u with OSH cultures
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.
   -          Continue steroids
   .
   # Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 33. Most likely
   dilutional in the setting of negative hemolysis/DIC labs x2.
   -          guaiac stools
   -          f/u HCT
   # Coagulopathy: Patient noted to have elevated coagulation factors, low
   albumin. Consider liver abnormality, even in setting of low LFTs.
   -vitamin K x 1 dose (yesterday)
   -F/u INR
   ..
   # FEN: IV fluids as needed with caution not to fluid overload the
   lungs, replete lytes as needed, TF started
   .
   # Access:  RIJ, 2 peripherals
   .
   # PPx:  heparin sc, colace, senna, lactulose. Would start IV PPI if TF
   need to be held for pronation/procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented with cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is on steroids for AEP treatment and antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. He is also receiving amphotericin for fungal infection prophylaxis. Oxygen requirements have improved since the patient was proned, and he is now off paralytics but on sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is still unclear, but potential causes include acute eosinophilic pneumonia, drug pneumonitis, vasculitis, or Loefler syndrome. Monitoring and adjusting treatment accordingly is important to prevent further deterioration.

2. Hematocrit Drop: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 46.6 at OSH to 36 in the ED and now 33. This is likely due to dilutional causes, but other possibilities such as hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation should be ruled out. Guaiac stools and further HCT monitoring are recommended.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated coagulation factors and low albumin, which may indicate liver abnormalities. Liver function tests (LFTs) are low but should still be closely monitored. Vitamin K supplementation and INR follow"

   Assessment and Plan
   A:
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure: (see yesterday note for full discussion
   of differential).  In addition, now it appears that patient has adrenal
   injury which may have led to the bronchial eosinophilia.
   Plan:
   - Decrease PEEP slowly as tolerated
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   2) Pneumonia:
   - continue antibiotics for bacteria, fungal
   3) Hypotension: may have been related to adrenal insufficiency
   - resolved
   4) Adrenal Insufficiency: I suspect adrenal hemorrhage or infarction
   5) Anemia
   - guiac stools
   6) Coagulopathy: vitamin K

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is acute respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia. There are also concerns about adrenal injury or insufficiency. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 18 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. Blood cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. Other medications include furosemide, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a need for immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have developed pneumonia, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and increased risk of infection.
3. Adrenal Injury or Insufficiency: The presence of bronchial eosinophilia suggests a possible adrenal injury or insufficiency, which can cause hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicate a coagulation disorder. This may"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclrear, but acute eosinophilic
   pneumonia vs. drug pneumonities, vasculitis or Loefler syndrome.
   Patient on steroids for AEP and antibiotics (ceftriaxone, levofloxacin,
   gentamycin, amphotericin). Oxygen requirements have improved since
   patient was proned, and is now off paralytics, on sedation. Also high
   on the differential at this point, given ? Freidrich-Waterhouse
   syndrome and low cortisol levels, are Neisseria, fungal infection. In
   terms of autoimmune etiology thus far ANCA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and RF are negative.
   Pending labs include ACE, anti-GBM, Chlamydia, leptospira, mycoplasma,
   HIV viral load.
   -          decrease PEEP as tolerated
   -          f/u cultures and pending labs, f/u with OSH cultures
   -          Continue antibiotics including ampho for now.
   -          Continue steroids
   # Adrenal insufficienty: likely [**1-5**] adrenal infarct. Continue steroids
   as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS involvement.
   -methylprednisolone
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Hematocrit drop - HCT 46.6 at OSH, 36 in ED, now 33. Most likely
   dilutional in the setting of negative hemolysis/DIC labs x2.
   -          guaiac stools
   -          f/u HCT
   -          check UA, hemolysis labs
   -          if continues would transfuse hct <25
   # Coagulopathy: Patient noted to have elevated coagulation factors, low
   albumin. Consider liver abnormality, even in setting of low LFTs. If
   coagulopathy, albumin does not resolve consider US RUQ.
   -vitamin K x 1 dose (yesterday)
   -F/u INR
   ..
   # FEN: IV fluids as needed with caution not to fluid overload the
   lungs, replete lytes as needed, TF started
   .
   # Access:  RIJ, 2 peripherals  art line
   .
   # PPx:  heparin sc, colace, senna, lactulose. Would start IV PPI if TF
   need to be held for pronation/procedure.
   .
   # Code:  Full Code
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until extubated

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear, but suggestive of AEP versus
   bacterial pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far and we have
   been peeling antibiotics slowly. However, oxygen requirements have
   improved since steroids were started. Fungal studies still pending as
   well as some rheumatologic studies.
   -          decrease PEEP as tolerated
   -          f/u cultures and pending labs, f/u with OSH cultures
   -          Continue antibiotics for now.
   -          Continue steroids at current dose
   -          Stop amphotericin
   # Adrenal insufficienty: likely [**1-5**] adrenal infarct. Continue steroids
   as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS involvement.
   -methylprednisolone
   - follow lactate
   - Endocrine consult
   .
   # Hematocrit drop
  HCT originally dropped, but has been stable for
   the last days. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic
   diseases. It could also be dilutional. No need for hemolysis labs
   again.
   -          guaiac stools
   -          f/u HCT
   -          if continues would transfuse hct <25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented with cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. He had recently traveled to [**Country 5083**]. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH and was found to have respiratory failure with unclear etiology, possibly atypical pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia. Cultures have not grown any pathogens so far. The patient's oxygen requirements have improved since starting steroids. Fungal studies and rheumatologic studies are still pending. The patient's condition is being managed with decreasing PEEP as tolerated, following cultures and pending labs, continuing antibiotics, and continuing steroids at the current dose. There is also a concern for adrenal insufficiency, likely due to an [**1-5**] adrenal infarct. Steroids are being continued as ordered and monitored for any petechial rashes or CNS involvement. The patient's hematocrit has dropped, but it has been stable for the last few days. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic disease. There is no need for hemolysis labs again. The plan is to guaiac stools, follow HCT, and if it continues, transfuse hct <25. IV fluids are being administered with caution to avoid fluid overload, and TF has been started. The patient has three vascular access lines. Prophylactic measures include heparin sc, colace, senna"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note mentions that the patient is doing well and continues to come down overnight. 

The patient has received various antibiotics including caspofungin, ambisome, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. They are also on infusions of midazolam (versed) and fentanyl (concentrate). Other medications include haloperidol (haldol), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (protonix).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 87 bpm with a normal range of 70-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/69 to 133/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a normal range of 14-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total intake of 3,811 mL and total output of 4,310 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -499 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at PRVC/AC mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   No new events overnight.  While on rounds, had episode of desaturation
   and decreased delivery of tidal volume - taken off ventilator and
   ventilator adjusted - unclear what caused but appears to have been
   mechanical and related to ventilator malfunction and not the patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18 year-old male with no significant past medical history
   other than recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   for hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear, but suggestive of AEP versus
   bacterial pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far and we have
   been peeling antibiotics slowly. However, oxygen requirements have
   improved since steroids were started. Fungal studies still pending as
   well as some rheumatologic studies.
   - decrease PEEP as tolerated, now at TV 500, R 14, PEEP 8, FI02 of 40%
   - pleural fluid negative for O+P, nothing has grown out
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - urine cx negative
   - histo pending, leptospira pending, mycoplasma pending, ace pending,
   anti-gbm pending
   - Continue antibiotics for now
 on day 7 of antibiotics, will continue
   to treat for 10 day course ( [**8-18**] end).
   -  Continue steroids at current dose until extubated and planning
   discharge
   -  cont ambisome pending negative histo antigen
   -continue to wean sedation as nursing is already doing
   - pressure support trials today with goal to extubate tomorrow
    # Adrenal insufficienty: possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, wanted
   to rule out secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection (however
   do not think that eosinophilic pneumonia could explain this). Continue
   steroids as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS
   involvement.
   -methylprednisolone as above
   - follow lactate
   - TSH 0.25 (low) T4 6.2 nl, T3 50 (low), calc TBG 1, uptake ratio 0.97,
   calc t4 index likely sick euthryroid syndrome
   - consider abdominal CT scan to look at adrenal glands better
   # Hematocrit drop
  HCT originally dropped, but has been stable for
   the last days. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic
   diseases. It could also be dilutional. No need for hemolysis labs
   again.
   - f/u HCT, guaic stools
   - if continues would transfuse hct <25
   # FEN: tube feeds, increased free water boluses in the setting of
   hypenatreamia, repleted lytes

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on a chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with likely eosinophilic pneumonia and is currently in the ICU.

The patient experienced problems with the ventilator yesterday morning, which resulted in being switched to CPAP for a short period before being placed back on assisted ventilation. Since then, the patient has successfully weaned down from FiO2 and RR.

The patient also has sick thyroid syndrome, as indicated by low TSH, T4, and T3 levels. The patient is being treated with steroids and is being monitored for any signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as petechial rashes or CNS involvement.

There has been a drop in hematocrit, which may be due to bleeding, chronic disease, or dilutional causes. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic disease. No hemolysis labs are required at this time.

The patient is receiving tube feeds and increased free water boluses due to hyponatremia. Electrolytes have been repleted. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and peripheral lines.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with PRVC/AC ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal range.

The patient is currently on day 7 of antibiotics and will continue the treatment for a 10-day course. Steroids have been started, and Ambisome (antifungal medication) will be continued pending negative histo antigen. The plan is to wean sedation and perform pressure support trials today with the goal of extubation tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nosocomial infections. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presents with hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has been transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to eosinophilic pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and oxygen requirements have improved since starting steroids. Other pending tests include fungal studies, rheumatologic studies, and pleural fluid analysis. The patient also has adrenal insufficiency, possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, and is being treated with steroids. His hematocrit has dropped, which could be due to bleeding, chronic disease, or dilutional causes. Iron studies suggest possible bleeding or chronic disease. The patient is receiving IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed, and his TF has been started. He has two peripheral art lines and a right internal jugular line for access. His code status is full code, and he is currently dispositioned to the ICU until extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the underlying cause is not identified and treated appropriately.
2. Eosinophilic Pneumonia: This condition can cause respiratory distress and may lead to complications such as hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory arrest.
3. Bacterial Pneumonia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and steroids. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an intake of 3,691 mL, output of 4,315 mL, and a negative balance of 624 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 195 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 6.9 L/min. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.2 x 10^9/L, slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 31.9%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 338 x 10^9/L, and normal kidney function with creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values, such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers, are within normal ranges. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient is also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased leukocyte count, and changes in sputum color or quantity, is crucial.
2. Barotrauma: High levels of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, which may manifest as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Regular chest radiographs should be performed to assess for any abnormalities.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improperly set ventilation parameters, such as high tidal volumes or excessive PEEP, can cause VILI. Adjusting the ventilation settings according to the patient"

   18 year-old male with no significant past medical history other than
   recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH for
   hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Current differential includes AEP vs
   bacterial/viral  pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far with
   several labs still pending. Antibiotics have been d/c
s which cover
   etiologies we do not feel are likely sources at this point. Oxygen
   requirements have continued to improve and extubation may be possible
   today. Fungal studies still pending as well as some rheumatologic
   studies.
   - pleural fluid negative for O+P, nothing has grown out
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - urine cx negative
   - histo pending, leptospira pending, mycoplasma pending, ace pending,
   anti-gbm pending
   - Continue antibiotics for now
 on day 7 of antibiotics, will continue
   to treat for 10 day course ( [**8-18**] end).
   -  Continue steroids at current dose until extubated and planning
   discharge
   -  cont ambisome pending negative histo antigen
   -continue to wean sedation as nursing is already doing
   - pressure support trials today with goal to extubate tomorrow
    # Adrenal insufficienty: possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, wanted
   to rule out secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection (however
   do not think that eosinophilic pneumonia could explain this). Continue
   steroids as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS
   involvement.
   -methylprednisolone as above
   - follow lactate
   - TSH 0.25 (low) T4 6.2 nl, T3 50 (low), calc TBG 1, uptake ratio 0.97,
   calc t4 index likely sick euthryroid syndrome
   - consider abdominal CT scan to look at adrenal glands better
   # Hematocrit drop
  HCT originally dropped, but has been stable for
   the last days. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic
   diseases. It could also be dilutional. No need for hemolysis labs
   again.
   - f/u HCT, guaic stools
   - if continues would transfuse hct <25

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, with symptoms including hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates seen on a chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) versus bacterial or viral pneumonia. Antibiotics have been discontinued as nothing has grown in cultures so far, and fungal studies are still pending.

The patient is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency, possibly secondary to an adrenal infarct or secondary adrenal failure due to infection. Steroids have been ordered, and the patient's TSH, T4, and T3 levels are being monitored. A consideration for an abdominal CT scan to better evaluate the adrenal glands has been made.

Additionally, the patient's hematocrit levels have dropped, which may be due to bleeding, chronic disease, or dilutional causes. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic disease. No further hemolysis labs are needed at this time.

Other ongoing care includes tube feeds, increased free water boluses in the setting of hypernatremia, repletion of electrolytes, and management of lines and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of vomiting. They have a history of allergies to aspirin and anaphylaxis. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including gentamicin, ambisome, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. They are also receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as other medications such as pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and changes to their medical and family history.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 40 bpm with episodes of bradycardia during sleep, blood pressure ranging from 120/65 to 150/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, fluid balance with a total input of 3,054 mL and output of 4,945 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,891 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and other parameters within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 year-old male with no significant past medical history other than
   recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH for
   hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Current differential includes AEP vs bacterial
   pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far and we have been
   peeling antibiotics slowly. However, oxygen requirements have improved
   since steroids were started. Fungal studies still pending as well as
   some rheumatologic studies.
   - decrease PEEP as tolerated, now at TV 500, R 14, PEEP 8, FI02 of 40%
   - pleural fluid negative for O+P, nothing has grown out
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - urine cx negative
   - histo pending, leptospira pending, mycoplasma pending, ace pending,
   anti-gbm pending
   - Continue antibiotics for now
 on day 7 of antibiotics, will continue
   to treat for 10 day course ( [**8-18**] end).
   -  Continue steroids at current dose until extubated and planning
   discharge
   -  cont ambisome pending negative histo antigen
   -continue to wean sedation as nursing is already doing
   - pressure support trials today with goal to extubate tomorrow
    # Adrenal insufficienty: possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, wanted
   to rule out secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection (however
   do not think that eosinophilic pneumonia could explain this). Continue
   steroids as ordered and monitor for any petechial rashes, CNS
   involvement.
   -methylprednisolone as above
   - follow lactate
   - TSH 0.25 (low) T4 6.2 nl, T3 50 (low), calc TBG 1, uptake ratio 0.97,
   calc t4 index likely sick euthryroid syndrome
   - consider abdominal CT scan to look at adrenal glands better
   # Hematocrit drop
  HCT originally dropped, but has been stable for
   the last days. Iron studies suggest either bleeding or chronic
   diseases. It could also be dilutional. No need for hemolysis labs
   again.
   - f/u HCT, guaic stools
   - if continues would transfuse hct <25
   # FEN: tube feeds, increased free water boluses in the setting of
   hypenatreamia, repleted lytes
   # Access:  RIJ, 2 peripherals  art line
   .  # PPx:  heparin sc, colace, [**Last Name (LF) 3354**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c lactulose in the setting

","The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented to the hospital with hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on a chest X-ray. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 195, suggesting adequate oxygenation but mild respiratory acidosis. The differential diagnosis includes acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) versus bacterial pneumonia. Steroids have been started, leading to improved oxygen requirements. Cultures have been negative so far, and antibiotics are being slowly tapered off. Fungal studies are still pending. 

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient possibly has secondary adrenal insufficiency due to an adrenal infarct or infection. Corticosteroids have been initiated, and the patient's thyroid function tests show low T4 and T3 levels, indicating sick euthyroid syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 year-old male with no significant past medical history other than
   recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH for
   hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Current differential includes AEP vs
   bacterial/viral  pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far with
   several labs still pending, including west nile virus and
   histoplasmosis. Antibiotics have been d/c
s which cover etiologies we
   do not feel are likely sources at this point. Ambisome was started for
   histoplasmosis however since there is low suspicion and it is causing
   significant side effects, will likely d/c.
   Patient was successfully extubated during rounds with shovel mask at
   60% and 98% SO2.
   - pleural fluid negative for O+P, nothing has grown out
   - blood culture NGTD
   - histo pending, will contact lab today
   - Continue antibiotics for now , will continue to treat for 10 day
   course ( [**8-18**] end).
   -  Continue steroids at current dose and will decrease tomorrow
   -  d/c ambisome (will continue to cause K for 7-10d post d/c)
    # Adrenal insufficienty: possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, wanted
   to rule out secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection (however
   do not think that eosinophilic pneumonia could explain this). Continue
   steroids and monitor and replete K. Also monitor Na.
   -CT abdomen today
   -monitor Na, K
   -f/u endo recs
   -methylprednisolone as above, will decrease tomorrow
   # Hematocrit drop
  stable
   - f/u HCT
   # FEN: S&S eval, advance diet to clears today, repleted lytes
   # Access:  RIJ, d/c art line
   .  # PPx:  heparin sc, colace, [**Last Name (LF) 3354**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c lactulose in the setting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was transferred to the hospital for hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and a chest X-ray showing bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. The differential diagnosis includes acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) versus bacterial or viral pneumonia. Cultures have not grown anything so far, and several labs are still pending, including West Nile virus and histoplasmosis. Antibiotics have been discontinued as they cover unlikely etiologies. Ambisome was started for histoplasmosis but will likely be discontinued due to significant side effects. The patient successfully underwent extubation during rounds with a shovel mask at 60% and 98% oxygen saturation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath, along with diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. This suggests a respiratory illness, and the differential diagnosis includes AEP, bacterial, or viral pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for an unspecified duration.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's laboratory results show low cortisol levels, and there is a suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. This may be secondary to an adrenal infarct or possibly due to secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection. Steroids are being continued, and monitoring sodium and potassium levels is essential.
3. Hematocrit"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They are experiencing acute respiratory failure, which has been managed with ventilator support. The patient had episodes of bradycardia overnight but did well on the ventilator. They were successfully extubated this morning. The patient has a history of aspirin anaphylaxis and is currently on multiple antibiotics and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-147/62-91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,054 mL and output of 4,945 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,891 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 10-500 mL. The respiratory support parameters are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurological assessment is incomplete.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Renal function tests are within normal limits."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and suspected adrenal insufficiency. The patient's medical history includes allergies to aspirin, anaphylaxis, and current ICU care. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-147/62-91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Gentamicin, Ambisome, Levofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone), pain management with Fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications are also mentioned, with a review of the complete medication list.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as slightly low potassium and sodium levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.52, indicating respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500"

   -Has been able to ambulate to chair.
   -CT chest/abd today am to work-up adrenal insufficiency. monitoring K,
   Na levels closely overnight. Hypokalemia has been an issue for the last
   couple of days and he has needed very aggressive repletion most likely
   due to ambisome. It was d/c's today however its effect will be around

   -the patient has been autodiuresing significantly over last couple of
   days (300-400cc/hr). This is likely [**1-5**] being fluid overloaded since

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM NOTE
   I reviewed the history and relevant labs on this patient and also
   examined him.  I was physically present for the key portions of the
   services provided.  I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5102**] has continued to fabulously well since the dark days of last
   weekend. Extubated yesterday he continues to feel  increasingly well
   and is eating and today has no complaints, being eager to start PT.
   Meds: Pred 60mg 4x/day, Ceftriax, [**Known lastname **] 750 qd, among others
   On exam: his saturation is 96% on 2L, with other VSS.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation;  Cor- RRR;   Ext- no edema
    Neuro
 alert and cooperative
   Lab:  Ca=7.7 but alb = 2.5  CT of the chest today is pending
   Imp: S/P resp failure due to ARDS from pneumonitis that is either an
   unclear infection or acute eosinophilic pneumonitis.  His seeming
   response to high dose steroids was very impressive, according to his
   MICU team.
            His polyuria could be mobilization of fluid, esp with his high
   dose steoids.  DI less likely
   Plan:
   1.       Decrease Pred to 60mg daily
   2.       Await chest CT
   3.       Follow u.o. in MICU for another 24 hr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was transferred to the hospital for hypoxia, cough, and shortness of breath, and his chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with respiratory failure and received treatment including antibiotics and high-dose steroids.

The patient's recent events include successful extubation, ambulation to a chair, and monitoring of potassium and sodium levels closely due to hypokalemia. The patient has been autodiuresing significantly over the last couple of days, which may be due to fluid overload or corticosteroid use. There is also a consideration of diabetes insipidus, although the patient is concentrating his urine.

The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/52 mmHg to 136/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear lung sounds and no edema on examination.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Other lab results are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include resolution of respiratory failure, possible adrenal insufficiency,"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 year-old male with no significant past medical history other than
   recent travel to [**Country 5083**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH for
   hypoxia in the setting of cough,SOB and a CXR showing bilat diffuse
   patchy infiltrates.
   # Respiratory failure: Current differential includes AEP vs
   bacterial/viral  pneumonia. Nothing has grown in cultures so far with
   several labs still pending, including west nile virus and
   histoplasmosis. Antibiotics have been d/c
s which cover etiologies we
   do not feel are likely sources at this point. Ambisome was started for
   histoplasmosis however since there is low suspicion and it is causing
   significant side effects, will likely d/c.
   Patient was successfully extubated during rounds with shovel mask at
   60% and 98% SO2.
   - pleural fluid negative for O+P, nothing has grown out
   - blood culture NGTD
   - histo pending, will contact lab today
   - Continue antibiotics for now , will continue to treat for 10 day
   course ( [**8-18**] end).
   -  Continue steroids at current dose and will decrease tomorrow
   -  d/c ambisome (will continue to cause K for 7-10d post d/c)
    # Adrenal insufficienty: possibly secondary to adrenal infarct, wanted
   to rule out secondary adrenal failure secondary to infection (however
   do not think that eosinophilic pneumonia could explain this). Continue
   steroids and monitor and replete K. Also monitor Na.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), bacterial/viral pneumonia, and histoplasmosis. Antibiotics have been discontinued as no growth has been observed in cultures. Ambisome, an antifungal medication, was started for histoplasmosis but will likely be discontinued due to its side effects. The patient was successfully extubated and is currently on a shovel mask with 60% and 98% oxygen saturation.

The patient's recent travel to Country 5083 is also mentioned, which may be relevant in considering potential infectious causes. The pleural fluid is negative for organisms, and blood cultures are pending. The patient will continue to receive a 10-day course of antibiotics.

In addition to respiratory issues, the patient is being treated for adrenal insufficiency, possibly secondary to an adrenal infarct or secondary adrenal failure. Steroids will be continued, and electrolyte levels will be closely monitored.

Other assessments and plans include monitoring hematocrit levels, advancing the patient's diet to clear liquids, and evaluating for signs and symptoms of fluid overload, given the recent diuresis and previous fluid overload. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal"

","The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history, who presented with cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. He had recent travel to Country 5083. Upon admission, he was transferred to Hospital1 and found to have bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has since resolved and is now comfortable on 2L NC.

The patient was treated with various antibiotics, including Ambisome, Levofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone. However, most antibiotics have been stopped, and Histoplasma culture is still pending. The patient is also receiving steroids, which will be switched to 60mg PO QD. A chest CT is planned today.

The patient's current issues include possible adrenal insufficiency, likely due to an adrenal infarct in the setting of hypotension and infection. However, the patient is exhibiting signs of hyperaldosteronism, possibly explained by excess IV steroids. Monitoring of sodium and potassium levels is crucial, and a follow-up with endocrine specialists is recommended.

Additionally, there is a concern about the patient's hematocrit drop, which is stable. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored, especially considering the autodiuresis of 300-400cc/hr. This may be due to fluid overload since admission or corticosteroid use. Diabetes insipidus should also be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of fever and cough for 2 days. The arterial line was stopped on 08/16/2109 at 12:06 PM. The patient successfully extubated yesterday morning and is doing well on a shovel mask. He has been able to ambulate to a chair. A CT chest/abd was done today to work up adrenal insufficiency, and monitoring of K+, Na levels is ongoing. Hypokalemia has been an issue for the last couple of days, and aggressive repletion is required, likely due to ambisome. The patient has been autodiuresing significantly over the last couple of days (300-400cc/hr). This could be due to fluid overload since admission, but corticosteroids may also be a contributing factor. Dilute diabetes insipidus (DI) should also be considered, although urine labs show that the patient is concentrating his urine.

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to aspirin and anaphylaxis.

Infusions:
The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 08/16/2109 at 10:00 PM.

Other medications:
The patient has been given Ambisome on 08/15/2109 at 04:00 PM, Levofloxacin on 08/16/2109 at 06:01 PM, and Cef"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with acute respiratory distress and was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. He was intubated and extubated, and his condition has improved. The patient is currently on a normal diet, has been repleting electrolytes as needed, and has required a large amount of potassium repletion. There are concerns about possible adrenal insufficiency due to hypotension and infection, as well as a potential adrenal infarct. The patient's blood cultures and pleural fluid analysis are pending. He is currently receiving steroids and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency, especially considering the possibility of an adrenal infarct. Monitoring sodium and potassium levels, considering a CT scan with contrast, and following up with endocrine recommendations are important.
2. Infection: As the patient's blood cultures and pleural fluid analysis are pending, there is a possibility of ongoing infection. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is essential.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance over the past 24 hours. This could indicate ongoing diuresis or insensible fluid losses. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
4. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, it is crucial to continue"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I reviewed the patient
s history and relevant labs reviewed and also
   examined him.  I was physically present with the MICU team for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I agree with the above note,
   including its assessment and plan.  I would emphasize the following:
   Overnight the pt has done well, without complaints except weakness. KCl
   repleted and prednisone decreased to 60mg daily
   On exam:  Sat = 95% on ra!  Afeb. Other VSS.  I/0 = 5 L neg overnite.
   Lungs clear.  U.O. still > 300 cc/hr
   Lab: Lytes normal, Leukocytosis decreasing.  CT chest shows just a
   scant degree of ground glass infiltrates, very much improved from last
   week.  Adrenals look normal  Small bilat pleural effusions persist
   Imp: Resp failure due to diffuse pulm infiltrates and brochoalveolar
   lavage eosinophilia, suggestive of AEP, now dramatically better with
   high dose steroids and pt essentially back to normal and CT nearly so!!
   I suspect his oliguria is due to reclaiming of third spaced fluid
   Plan:
   1.       To floor today with central line (till KCL requirement
   decreases)
   2.       Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] till U.O. decreases
   3.       Wean Pred to 40mg daily, given his nearly normal lungs on CT
   4.       Have pulmonary consult team follow on the wards.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented with acute respiratory distress and was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). The patient underwent intubation and extubation and is currently doing well. The patient's condition has improved with aggressive repletion of potassium, large urine output, and improvement in lung infiltrates on CT scan. The patient's allergies include aspirin and anaphylaxis. The patient received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, Ambisome, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/59 mmHg to 141/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery and spontaneous breathing. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at bases and fine crackles at bases. The patient's labs show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for elevated potassium levels. The patient's assessment and plan include resolving respiratory failure, addressing polyuria, possible adrenal insufficiency, hematocrit drop, and nutritional support. The attending physician reviewed the patient's history, relevant labs, and examined him"
