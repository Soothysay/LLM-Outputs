   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man who experienced a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was rapidly cooled, but remains unresponsive with myoclonus, suggesting a severe hypoxic injury. The cause of this presentation is unclear. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and depression. He is currently on multiple medications including antiarrhythmics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) arrest: The patient had a witnessed VF arrest, which could be due to a variety of causes such as arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischemia, or medication toxicity.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive despite receiving fluids and brief phenylephrine. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication-induced hypotension.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has been hypoxic despite being on mechanical ventilation and an increased FiO2. This could be due to lung injury, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although low suspicion, there is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers or other causes.
5. Diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia on arrival and is currently on an insulin infusion. It is important to maintain tight glycemic control.
6. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to early shock liver or medication"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with unknown cause of VF arrest. They have a history of type I diabetes mellitus and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU, unresponsive, and unable to provide history. They are sedated and have encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 81/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory support device being an endotracheal tube, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for seizure activity. The patient has been experiencing myoclonic jerks and seizures despite receiving medications such as lorazepam, dilantin, and fosphenytoin. Propofol and phenytoin have been started with some improvement. The patient's ABG showed worsening hypercapnia and hypoxia, leading to increased FiO2 and a chest X-ray being obtained.

The patient has several allergies including ibuprofen, procainamide, sotalol, and amiodarone. They have been receiving infusions of insulin, midazolam, propofol, dilantin, lorazepam,"

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report.
   - Further history from daughter, who was present when he collapsed
   - CTA (done and wet read negative) - f/u final read
   - F/u Urine and serum toxicology
   - Telemetry
   - Initiate therapeutic hypothermia with goal temp 34.5 C. HOB > 30
   degrees, goal pCO2 35-40. Page with questions - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**] [**Numeric Identifier 5172**]
   - Add to VF arrest hypothermia study and randomize to receive
   hydrocortisone 100 q8h IV for 7 days post-arrest.
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Defer digoxin until a.m.
   - Diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Warfarin 5 mg PO QD
   .
   Coma
     Likely hypoxic injury given non-responsiveness and myoclonus.
   Difficult to determine outcome at present, particularly given sedation,
   cooling, paralysis, other medications. Nonetheless, neurologic
   examination shows no reflex activity whatever. Myoclonus can sometimes
   represent post-hypoxic myoclonic epilepsy. EEG at present shows
   near-isoelectric potentials interupted by bursts of slow activity with
   superimposed faster rhythm at similar intervals to which myoclonus was
   observed before paralysis. Seizure possible and will treat if
   indicated.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Will follow,
   particularly now giving back some diltiazem. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Trend enzymes
   - EKG
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Some likely clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining
   shape. No other blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach -
   think may be against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Heparin SC TID
   - Warfarin to continue
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival. Will convert to
   sliding scale when re-warmed.
   - Insulin IV sliding scale gtt
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   - Initiate therapeutic hypothermia with goal temp 33C. HOB>30 degrees,
   goal pCO2 35-40. Page with questions - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**] [**Numeric Identifier 5172**]
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - CMV while paralysed and on Artic Sun
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar until discuss in a.m.
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]

   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, currently in the ICU. The patient has been sedated, encephalopathic, and unresponsive. He has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient's condition is concerning for severe hypoxic injury, with neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus. The differential diagnosis includes arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischemia, and medication toxicity. The patient is being treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and further evaluation is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of taking three anti-arrhythmic medications (atenolol, diltiazem, and digoxin). Ventricular ectopy and short runs of VT have been observed. The patient will be monitored with telemetry, and metoprolol will be added back in small doses.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's presentation of hypoxia and hypotension could be suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. Further investigation is needed, including a CT angiogram if indicated.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has active coronary artery disease, and troponin/enzyme leak is expected due to DC cardioversion and chest compressions. EKG and telemetry will be used to monitor the patient's cardiac status.
4. Medication toxicity: The patient's presentation could"

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10742**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD
   on:[**2119-4-7**] 13:30 ------
","The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxic injury. He is currently in the ICU, sedated, and intubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 81/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's neurological status is concerning for severe hypoxic injury. He is unresponsive with myoclonus every 10 to 20 seconds involving limbs primarily. His EEG shows burst suppression with no seizure activity. He is currently being treated with multiple antiepileptic medications.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, for which he takes three antiarrhythmic medications (atenolol, diltiazem, and digoxin). His recent EKG showed ventricular ectopy and short runs of VT. He also has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate level, and abnormal liver enzyme levels. His electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's chest X-ray is clear.

The patient's plan includes continued cooling for 12 to 24 hours, then re-evaluation of neurologic status as rewarmed. Sedation and paralysis will be weaned. The medical team is following neurology input regarding EEG and prognosis management. Te"

   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

","The patient presented with a chief complaint of VF (ventricular fibrillation) arrest. The 24-hour events indicate that the patient experienced biogenesis, which is a brief loss of consciousness, for about 15 minutes. Their electrolytes were normal during this event and it resolved spontaneously. The patient was previously on dilantin, but it was stopped. The endotracheal (ET) tube was changed from size 6 to size 8 due to paralytic administration. The ET tube was advanced and is currently positioned 6.6 cm above the incisors. It is recommended to follow up on the final read. 

The patient has shown increasing FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) and PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) requirements throughout the day, despite adjustments in the ventilator settings. The addition of fentanyl to increase sedation was ineffective, and the patient required re-paralysis. Neurology advised holding paralysis and sedation before their evaluation in the morning so that they can assess more effectively. 

The patient's temperature spiked to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and they started to develop brown, purulent-appearing sputum. Despite the lack of infiltrate, empirical antibiotics were initiated due to profound hypoxia. The sputum culture grew GNRs (gram-negative rods) 4+ in a good sample, indicating that the antibiotics were appropriate. 

The patient has allergies to ibuprofen, causing GI upset, procainamide"

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who experienced a witnessed cardiac arrest at home and was subsequently intubated in the emergency department. The patient underwent rapid cooling, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus are concerning for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is unclear.

The patient's current condition includes:
- GCS 3, with spinal reflexes 3+, indicating some recovery but a poor prognosis.
- Burst suppression pattern on EEG when sedatives were held.
- Generalized myoclonic jerks.
- Appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2 levels.
- Intact brainstem respiratory circuitry.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest: The differential diagnosis includes arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischemia, and possible toxicity. The patient is likely experiencing ventricular ectopy and may need telemetry monitoring. Metoprolol will be administered IV q4h, and digoxin and diltiazem will be held.
2. Gastroparesis: The patient may have hypoperfusion leading to paralysis. Pro-cholinergics may be tried if desired to give PO meds or tube feeds.
3. Fluid status: The patient has a negative fluid balance. Maintenance IV fluids will be given at 125 cc/hr for 1 L, followed by reevaluation.
4. Hypotension (and hypertension): The patient's blood pressure"

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .
   FEN:
   - No fluid for now
   - Electrolytes: Keep K > 4 and Mg > 2
   - No nutrition for tonight

","The patient is a 70-year-old man who experienced a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was successfully resuscitated but remains unresponsive with myoclonus, suggesting severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is unclear.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is taking multiple medications including antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, digoxin, and statins.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% FiO2. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose level, lactate level, and liver enzymes. His electrolytes are within normal limits. The ECG shows no new changes.

The patient has been placed on full code status and is currently being managed in the ICU. The plan includes continuing aggressive management of his critical condition, monitoring for any signs of improvement or deterioration, and discussing the prognosis with the family.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of neurological function, development of pneumonia due to prolonged intubation, and complications related to diabetes and hypertension management. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent and manage these potential"
