   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, pulmonary embolism (s/p IVC placement), obesity, and bilateral total knee replacements. He was admitted to the hospital with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SCN), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and subsequently developed post-operative non-oliguric renal failure, ileus, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) despite amiodarone treatment.

The patient's 24-hour events include being extubated on [**2-4**], developing post-op non-oliguric renal failure, ileus, and runs of NSVT despite amiodarone. The patient has allergies to lorazepam causing agitation. The last dose of antibiotics was administered, and he is currently receiving infusions of amiodarone and heparin sodium. Other medications and ICU care are as per the resident's note.

The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, nausea, emesis, anemia, and no signs or concerns for abuse. The flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within normal limits. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of +347 mL since 85 AM. The patient has received a total of 517 mL of intravenous fluids and has had a total output of 170 mL of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), renal failure, and cellulitis. The patient has a history of hypertension, gout, anemia, splenectomy, and previous pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C (95.7°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 134/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including amiodarone, heparin sodium, metoprolol, pantoprazole, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. 

The patient has several medical complications, including nonoliguric renal failure presumed to be acute tubular necrosis from hypertonic saline during a septic period, fluid overload with ongoing diuresis as tolerated, ileus with nasogastric tube decompression, hyponatremia likely related to congestive heart failure, bilateral cellulitis with marked margins and follow-up planned, left septic knee with a planned procedure on POD#6, and a history of hypertension, gout, anemia, splenectomy, and previous pulmonary embolism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous left knee arthroplasty for a septic joint. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and complications related to his medical conditions.

24-hour events:
- An ultrasound of the kidneys was performed.
- An EKG was done, and the patient's amiodarone infusion was stopped, with the initiation of IV Lopressor for goal HR 55-65. However, runs of PVCs nearly every 3 beats prompted the restarting of amiodarone around 10 pm.
- ID consultation was sought, and it was decided to continue daptomycin and ceftriaxone. The dose of ceftriaxone was increased to 2g IV q24h, and there is a possibility of adding rifampin at some point, considering the patient's liver disease and potential medication interactions. Weekly CPK and CBC, diff, LFTs, and Bun/Cr checks were advised.
- The patient's current ID provider, Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 10988] from [Hospital3 5666], will be contacted to discuss the management plan.
- Ortho consultation was requested due to elevated ESR/CRP levels and pending knee films.
- Renal ultrasound could not be done due to the patient's large body habitus.
- Creatinine levels have increased from 5.2 to 6.0.

Current medications:
- Heparin sodium infusion at 2,150 units/hour
- Amiodarone infusion at 1 mg/min
- Furosemide (Lasix) given on [2184-2-9] at 08:15 AM
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) given on [2184-2-9] at 08:00 PM
- Morphine sulfate given on [2184-2-9] at 08:00 PM
- Metoprolol given on [2184-2-10] at 03:08 AM

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of NSVT and ongoing arrhythmias, which can be attributed to his underlying heart condition and medication interactions.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 5.2 to 6.0, indicating possible renal dysfunction. This may be due to recent hypotension and sepsis, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Sepsis: The patient has multiple recent cultures potentially growing multiple organisms, and there is a concern for ongoing infection, especially considering the history of septic joint and antibiotic spacer placement.
4. Gout: The patient is taking colchicine for gout, but it has been held due to recent medical events. Avoiding NSAIDs and considering prednisone if symptoms flare are recommended.
5. Esophageal varices: The patient has chronic and stable esophageal varices, which may require monitoring and potential banding or sclerotherapy if bleeding occurs.
6. Hepatic steatosis: Liver function tests should be monitored, and the patient's hepatic condition should be assessed.
7. Ileus: The patient has confirmed ileus, which needs to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a previous left knee arthroplasty. The patient was admitted to the ICU for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is currently on IV amiodarone. The patient's current condition includes acute kidney injury with worsening creatinine levels, ileus, and multiple infections, including a possible prosthetic joint infection with Staphylococcus lugdunensis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperadrenergic state due to surgery and/or volume overload, which may lead to arrhythmias.
2. Possible prerenal azotemia due to surgery, indicated by a BUN:Cr ratio of 10.
3. Potential worsening of kidney function with increasing creatinine levels.
4. Ileus, which can lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or infection.
5. Multiple infections, including a possible prosthetic joint infection with Staphylococcus lugdunensis.
6. Chronic cellulitis and foot wounds on both feet.
7. History of pulmonary embolisms with an IVC filter in place.
8. Esophageal varices, which could potentially bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms with an inferior vena cava filter, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of septic joint leading to left knee arthroplasty. The patient presented to the emergency department with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include an ultrasound of the kidneys, which could not be performed due to the patient's large body habitus, and an EKG that showed stopping of amiodarone gtt and the initiation of IV Lopressor for goal HR 55-65. The patient experienced runs of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and was restarted on amiodarone gtt around 10 pm.

Medical orders include the continuation of daptomycin and ceftriaxone, with plans to increase the dose of ceftriaxone to 2g IV q24h. The use of rifampin is being considered, but the risk/benefit analysis needs to be weighed given the patient's liver disease and potential medication interactions. Weekly CPK levels and CBC, diff, LFTs, and bun/creatinine are to be monitored.

The patient has allergies to lorazepam and agitation. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on ["

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, history of recurrent pulmonary embolisms, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a recent left knee arthroplasty. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his post-operative complications. His current vitals include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 to 142/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool delivery device, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of septic joint leading to left knee arthroplasty, which was complicated by an infection caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including tobramycin, vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone. His recent laboratory results show leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, and elevated creatinine levels indicating possible renal impairment. The patient also has edema in both lower extremities and a rash symmetrically distributed over his shins.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hyperadrenergic state and volume overload: The patient's recent episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is believed to be related to hyperadrenergic state secondary to surgery"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal issues: The patient's BUN:Cr ratio is 10, indicating possible prerenal azotemia. There is also a mention of checking urine electrolytes and eosinophils, suggesting the possibility of renal involvement. Lasix (furosemide) has been prescribed to address this concern.

2. Septic joint: The patient had a septic joint following left knee arthroplasty, and cultures are potentially growing multiple organisms. Antibiotic spacers were placed, and the patient is on multiple antibiotics including tobramycin, vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone.

3. Lower extremity edema: The patient has significant edema in both lower extremities, which may indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other circulatory issues. Heparin has been started as prophylaxis.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s and 90s, indicating hypotension. SBPs are ranging from 80s-90s, and the patient received 1 liter of normal saline at midnight, which improved blood pressure to 120/50. Another liter of normal saline was given at 0200 when blood pressure dropped to 90/40.

5. Ileus: The patient has an ileus confirmed by OSH records, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including pulmonary embolism (PE), acute renal failure (ARF), obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ventricular tachycardia (VT), pain control, and septic arthritis.

During the 24-hour period, the patient had blood cultured and a multi-lumen central line placed. Their hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped from 28% to 21%, so they were cross-matched for 2 units and repeated Hct, which increased back to 28%. The patient's nasogastric tube (NGT) was clamped without any issues, and they are tolerating advances in their diet. There were no premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and the possibility of starting metoprolol PO was considered. Renal function is being monitored, and hemodialysis (HD) is not required at this time.

The patient has allergies to lorazepam, causing agitation. They have been receiving antibiotics, specifically daptomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as pantoprazole (Protonix) and morphine sulfate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms with an inferior vena cava filter, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous left knee arthroplasty. He is currently admitted to the ICU for septic joint complications and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient's chief complaint is leukocytosis and low-grade fevers of unknown etiology. He has multiple medical complications including ileus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, bilateral cellulitis/foot wounds, anemia, glaucoma, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gout, esophageal varices, hepatic steatosis, and malnutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal dysfunction: The patient has worsening GFR and electrolyte imbalances, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output, BUN/creatinine, and electrolytes is recommended.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, possibly related to his previous septic joint or the presence of an IVC filter.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and is currently on beta-blockers. Continuous cardiac monitoring and consideration of increasing the dose of Metop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PEs) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and previous left knee arthroplasty. He was admitted to the ICU for septic joint following left knee resection and placement of antibiotic spacers. The patient has multiple comorbidities and complications, including acute renal failure, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic cellulitis on bilateral shins, and esophageal varices.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Continued monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes is recommended. Hemodialysis may be necessary if the renal function does not improve.
2. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient has experienced episodes of NSVT, which requires ongoing cardiac monitoring. Beta-blockers like metoprolol have been initiated, and the patient's PVC trend should be evaluated for consideration of increasing the beta-blocker dose.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, heart failure, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presented to the hospital with a history of septic joint in the left knee, which required arthroplasty. The patient has been in the ICU for the past few days and has experienced several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there is a concern for hypotension, especially considering the ongoing use of vasodilators (e.g., beta blockers) to control blood pressure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated levels of BUN and creatinine. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, and the patient may require dialysis.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fevers, suggesting a possible infection. The knee culture reportedly grew Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, there is a risk of developing resistant organisms or other infections due to prolonged antibiotic use.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient had a brief episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), indicating a potential risk for more severe arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms (PE), and a left knee arthroplasty for septic joint. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA and refuses CPAP therapy. His oxygen saturation will be monitored overnight.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient had an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is being monitored. Beta-blockers are being used to manage this condition.
4. Septic Joint: The patient had a septic joint in his left knee, which required arthroplasty. Cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.
5. Ileus: The patient is tolerating apple sauce and jello, indicating improvement in his ability to pass gas and have bowel movements. Transitioning IV medications to PO and advancing diet as tolerated are planned.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with metoprolol.
7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is holding his statin medication due to known liver issues.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent pulmonary embolisms, and a left knee arthroplasty. The patient presented with acute renal failure, likely prerenal due to recent surgery and inadequate fluid resuscitation. He also has leukocytosis and low-grade fevers of unclear etiology. The patient underwent septic joint replacement for Staphylococcus aureus infection in his left knee and has multiple recent cultures potentially growing multiple organisms. His current medications include daptomycin, ceftriaxone, heparin gtt, and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's recent lab results show elevated creatinine levels and acute kidney injury. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring for potential complications such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and wound infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary embolisms and is at risk for another one due to his immobility and hypercoagulable state.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic joint infection and is currently receiving antibiotics for possible ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis is essential.
3. Wound infection: The patient underwent septic joint replacement surgery, and there is a possibility of wound"
