   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   73F with paraplegia, COPD, recurrent UTI, presenting with UTI,
   confusion, mild hypoxia and relative hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Mild but past notes support general baseline in the
   100s-110s.  Initial response to 3L NS but then dropped again. Had some
   low BPs upon arrival to unit, with subsequent stabilization in her
   baseline range.  Differential includes volume depletion, sepsis,
   cardiogenic etiology.  Currently appears euvolemic.
   - Follow lactates.
   - Add on CEs, follow ECGs.
   - Follow UOP.
   - Treatment of UTI and other infectious workup as detailed below.
   - Consider Aline if still low.
   - If drops again, would try another 0.5-1L; if still low this would
   represent adequate fluid resuscitation and would favor CVL and
   pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxia.  Carries COPD diagnosis and intermittently sent home from
   the hospital with O2, though not currently O2 dependent.  Some rhonchi
   on exam.  Differential includes bronchospasm/COPD flare, heart failure
   (no evidence on exam, but received a fair amount of fluid), PE (less
   likely as chest pain free; is immobile but relatively far out from
   paraplegia onset), hypoventilation from meds or altered mental status.
   No evidence of pneumonia.  Now satting very well on 4L, can likely
   titrate down.
   - Nebs ATC and prn.  Hold on prednisone for now.
   - Check BNP; consider diuresis and TTE.
   - Repeat CXR in AM.
   - Consider PECT if continues to be hypoxic, though other etiologies
   more likely.
   - Consider ABG.
   - ECG and CEs.
   - Consider Aline.
   .
   # Fever.  To 102 as above.  No sick contacts.  Known UTI.  Also
   consider sacral decub as source, though appears to be improving.
   - Flu swab for r/o flu given fever plus cough and sore throat.
   - Treat UTI.
   - F/u blood and urine cultures.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check LFTs.
   - consider further imaging of decub/pelvis.
   .
   # UTI.  Has had a number of FQ and 2nd-3rd genereation cephalosporin
   resistent organisms in the past.  Also history of enterococcus in the
   past.  She is unsure of when her last UTI was.  On Bactrim as
   prophylaxis.
   - Zosyn and vanco for now given hypotension and general severity of
   illness; will continue FQ for now as well until culture results
   available.
   - Would broaden to cover VRE and ESBL orgs (though no history of
   either) given recurrent UTI history and exposure to rehab setting
   recently.
   - ?need suprapubic catheter.
   .
   # Confusion.  Quite clear currently.  Seems to be global deficit; exam
   nonfocal compared to baseline given paraplegia - makes effect of
   systemic illness more likely.
   - Treatment of UTI as above.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Consider hold mood altering meds.
   .
   # Sacral decub.  Stage IV, though reportedly is improved from prior.
   Does not seem overtly infection, though consider as source of sepsis as
   above.
   - wound care consult.
   - covering with vanc/zosyn/cipro for now.
   - consider MRI or other imaging.
   .
   # Abdominal distension.  Patient reports no change from baseline.  No
   BMs x few days.
   - Continue miralax daily with senna/colace, bisacodyl prn.
   .
   # Paraplegia.
   - Continue home meds (tizanidine, baclofen, gabapentin, nortriptyline).

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with paraplegia, COPD, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the ICU with confusion, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), Heart rate 84 bpm, Blood pressure 118/36 mmHg, Respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 95%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is euvolemic, with a fluid balance of +2059 mL since 12 AM, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.
- Laboratory results: White blood cell count 6.6 K/uL, Hematocrit 33.4%, Platelet count 306 K/uL, Creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, Glucose 144 mg/dL, Other labs within normal range.
- Imaging: PA and lateral chest X-ray shows subtle silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm, which may correspond to increased opacity noted on the lateral view. Atelectasis or an early infiltrate involving the right lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
- Microbiology: Blood culture is pending, urine culture is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with paraplegia, COPD, and a history of recurrent UTIs. She presented with confusion, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. She has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently receiving treatment with Zosyn and vancomycin. Her confusion is being managed by treating the UTI, contacting the family to compare her current status with baseline, and considering the holding of mood-altering medications. She also has hypoxia, which is not currently dependent on oxygen at home but has been in the past for COPD. Her hypotension has resolved, and she appears euvolemic. She has a fever, known UTI, and a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer that is reportedly improving. She is also experiencing abdominal distension, paraplegia, and replete electrolytes. She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be discharged to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent UTIs: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, including resistance to fluoroquinolones and second/third-generation cephalosporins. She currently has a UTI, and it is important to narrow antibiotic coverage once culture results are available to avoid promoting antibiotic resistance.
2. Sacral decub"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, COPD, recurrent UTIs, and confusion. She presented with a UTI, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 118/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has trace upper and lower extremity edema, small pressure ulcers on bilateral heels, and absent lower extremity sensation and movement. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging shows subtle silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm, which may correspond to increased opacity noted on the lateral view. Atelectasis or an early infiltrate involving the right lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded.

The assessment and plan include treating the UTI with Zosyn, vancomycin, and continuing with FQ until culture results are available. Broad-spectrum coverage will be considered for VRE and ESBL organisms due to recurrent UTI history and exposure to a rehab setting. The possibility of changing the suprapubic catheter is also mentioned. 

For confusion, treatment of UTI as above, contact family about comparing her current status to baseline, and consider"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presented with symptoms of a UTI, confusion, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was diagnosed with septic shock, but this condition has now resolved after a fluid challenge overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result indicating ///25. This suggests potential respiratory failure, but the specific cause and severity are not clearly stated in the progress note.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension and was diagnosed with septic shock. However, it is mentioned that the hypotension has resolved after a fluid challenge overnight. Close monitoring will be required to ensure the patient remains stable.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a plan to change the antibiotic course to vanc/zosyn/cipro until culture results are available. Monitoring for signs of infection or antibiotic resistance will be important.

4. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing mild hypoxia, which may be related to her underlying COPD or the current respiratory failure. Oxygen therapy will be necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with paraplegia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), presenting with a UTI, confusion, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing signs of improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored due to her COPD and acute respiratory failure. She is on supplemental oxygen and her ABG results indicate hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension but has responded well to fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is essential.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and her current symptoms suggest another infection. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted to cover common pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Regular urine cultures and urinalysis should be performed.
4. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. Wound care consultation and appropriate management are recommended to prevent further complications such as infection or worsening of the ulcer.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile due to paraplegia, she is at increased risk for DVT. Pro"

   Imaging: [**10-16**] CXR
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
   change. Marked tortuosity of the contour of the descending aorta.
   Interval appearance of retrocardiac atelectasis. On today's
   examination, there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that
   a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No newly appeared focal parenchymal
   opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged
   appearance of the left-sided rib defects.
   appears improved vs

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   73F with paraplegia, COPD, recurrent UTI, presenting with UTI,
   confusion, mild hypoxia and relative hypotension.
   # UTI.  Has had a number of FQ and 2nd-3rd genereation cephalosporin
   resistent organisms in the past.  Also history of enterococcus in the
   past.  She is unsure of when her last UTI was.  On Bactrim as
   prophylaxis.
   - Stopped Bactrim on admission
   - Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro on [**10-15**] = day 1, today is day 3
   - Afebrile since admission
   - Has low bp's at baseline, although admission pressures were a little
   bit lower than baseline
   - Concern that UCx is contaminated with fecal flora
 raises concern
   for vesiculo-enteric fistula. Will touch base with urology about how to
   assess this. Also will contact lab and tell them to speciate and get
   sensitivities of bacteria.
   - Repeat UCx
   - Needs suprapubic catheter replacement
 Replaced q month.
   # Hypoxia.  Not currently O2 dependent at home but has been in the past
   for COPD.  Was volume up on admission and received Lasix and got some
   yesterday. Doesn't appear too volume up currently, not tachypneic and
   satting well on NC
   - continue nebs.
   # Hypotension.  Resolved this morning, UOP remained good and patient
   appears grossly euvolemic. Has baseline low bp's in the 100's.
   - Will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today.
   # Fever.  Known UTI.  Also consider sacral decub as source, though
   appears to be improving.  LFTs were normal. Has been afebrile since
   admission.
   - f/u flu given fever plus cough and sore throat.  Now afebrile.
   - Treat UTI as above
   - F/u blood and urine cultures.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - consider further imaging of decub/pelvis.
   # Sacral decub.  Stage IV, though reportedly is improved from prior.
   Does not seem overtly infection, though consider as source of sepsis as
   above.
   - wound care consult pending
   - covering with vanc/zosyn/cipro for now.
   - consider MRI or other imaging.
   # Abdominal distension.  Not tender to palpation and normal on PE
   - Continue miralax daily with senna/colace, bisacodyl prn.
   # Paraplegia.
   - Continue home meds (tizanidine, baclofen, gabapentin, nortriptyline).

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, COPD, and recurrent UTIs, presenting with a UTI, confusion, mild hypoxia, and relative hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on day 3 of her admission. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/41 mmHg to 79/27 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient's lab results show white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 10.9 g/dL, sodium at 156 mg/dL, potassium at 0.5 mg/dL, glucose at 165 mg/dL, and creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL. 

Imaging reveals a marked tortuosity of the descending aorta, interval appearance of retrocardiac atelectasis, blunting of the left costophrenic sinus indicating a minimal left pleural effusion, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia, and unchanged appearance of the left-sided rib defects.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), UTI, confusion, mild"
