","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hypogammaglobulinemia, and mastocytosis presenting to the ICU with symptoms of anaphylactic shock. He is currently experiencing hypotension, fever, and a sore throat. The patient has a history of anaphylactoid reactions and previous ICU admission for similar symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is already diagnosed with anaphylactic shock, which is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure and inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
2. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's history of anaphylactoid reactions and current symptoms, there is a risk of further anaphylactic episodes if exposed to allergens.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunodeficiency state increases the risk of developing sepsis, especially if there is an underlying infection.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, suggesting possible acute renal failure, which could be due to pre-renal physiology or another cause.
5. Anion gap acidosis: Elevated lactate levels indicate potential anion gap acidosis, possibly related to hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion.
6. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's hypotension and diastolic blood pressure readings may suggest diastolic heart failure, although"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hypogammaglobulinemia, and mastocytosis, presented with sore throat, subjective fever, and hypotension. He was initially on broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluids (IVF) due to suspected infection. However, his symptoms were consistent with anaphylaxis given his history of mastocytosis. The patient's vital signs showed sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. His central venous pressure (CVP) was within normal range. Fluid balance showed a positive intake of 327 mL and output of 410 mL over 24 hours. The patient received multiple blood products and had an NG tube in place. Laboratory results indicated acute renal failure, anion gap acidosis, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's medications were adjusted based on various medical conditions including shock, anaphylaxis, acute renal failure, anion gap acidosis, diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, dyslipidemia, and nutritional support. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be kept in the ICU until a good plan is in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of mastocytosis-like syndrome and associated anaphylactoid reactions. He presented to the emergency department with his usual prodrome of symptoms and was found to have hypotension but not tachycardia. Two liters of intravenous fluid boluses were administered without significant improvement, so the patient received IV Benadryl, IV Levofloxacin, and IV Solu-Medrol. A central venous line was placed and dopamine was started at 10 mcg, which resulted in an improvement of the patient's hemodynamic status. The patient was then transferred to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.3°F and is currently on supplemental oxygen due to difficulty breathing. He has a history of allergies to Zithromax (Azithromycin), wheezing, and hives. The patient also has a documented allergy to heparin agents and has developed a rash. The last doses of antibiotics given were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04-07-2163 at 01:41 AM and Vancomycin on 04-07-2163 at 08:11 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 138/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range at 11 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 327 mL and output of 410 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -83 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///19/. Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, attentive mental status, and no muscle wasting.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 85 K/uL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, glucose of 233 mg/dL, sodium of 19 mEq/L, potassium of 3.3 mEq/L, chloride of 34 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values include a PT/PTT/INR of 16.0/27.1/1.4, lactic acid of 4.0 mmol/L, calcium of 7.8 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.6 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan include continued treatment for anaphylact"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 82-year-old male with CLL, hypogammaglobulinemia, and a history of mastocytosis. He presented with sore throat, subjective fever, and hypotension. He was found to have Clostridium difficile on stool culture and was likely triggered by healthcare contacts during IVIG infusions. The patient has been treated for anaphylaxis and C. difficile infection. His current condition includes shock, anaphylactic; C. difficile infection; acute renal failure; anion gap acidosis; diastolic heart failure; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; asthma; and dyslipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - Most likely due to mastocytosis and anaphylaxis. The patient's presentation includes sore throat, subjective fever, and hypotension. Immediate treatment is required to stabilize blood pressure and prevent further complications.
2. Clostridium difficile infection - The patient has acquired this infection from healthcare contacts during IVIG infusions. It is essential to continue the prescribed 14-day course of treatment to clear the infection and prevent recurrence.
3. Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential pre-renal physiology. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Anion gap acidosis - The patient's lactate levels are elevated, suggesting possible hypotension-induced lactic acidosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 82-year-old male with a history of CLL, hypogammaglobulinemia, and mastocytosis who presented with sore throat, subjective fever, and hypotension. The patient was found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection on stool culture and was likely experiencing anaphylactic reaction due to mastocytosis. The hypotension has resolved. The patient was initially on broad-spectrum antibiotics but has been switched to oral prednisone for his mastocytosis regimen. He is also receiving PO Benadryl, PO ranitidine, and has stopped vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. The patient received IVIG yesterday and had a Foley catheter and central line discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.5, indicating a possible pre-renal physiology. The plan is to monitor the trend and hold lasix while adding it back tomorrow if stable.
2. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, suggesting possible anion gap acidosis. The plan is to continue monitoring the lactate levels and trend them.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient is being monitored closely for signs of diastolic heart failure. He received 2 L IVF and will have lasix added back"

   experienced his usual prodrome of symptoms.  Hypotensive to SBP 70s in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of recurrent anaphylactoid reactions, CLL, hypogammaglobulinemia, and mastocytosis. He presented to the ED with symptoms of hypotension, sore throat, and subjective fever. He was found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) in his stool and was likely experiencing anaphylaxis due to mastocytosis. The patient received IVIG infusions every 3 weeks, which may have led to the acquisition of the C. diff infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - Resolved: The patient initially presented with hypotension, but it has since resolved.
2. Anaphylactic Shock: The patient is diagnosed with anaphylactic shock, likely due to mastocytosis.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient acquired C. diff infection, likely from healthcare contacts during IVIG infusions. He is currently being treated for this infection.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected of having acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5. It is believed to be pre-renal in nature.
5. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, indicating possible anion gap acidosis.
6. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is being monitored closely for diastolic heart failure, and measures are being taken"
