   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 31 yom with history of MVA in Bolivia in [**2091**] with resultant
   quadriplegia s/p several VP shunts and seizure disorder who presents
   from home with seizures.
   # Seizures:  Patient presents with typical seizures which have been
   controlled for four years on Keppra.  Patient with +UTI on UA which is
   likely source of infection.  Patient given Vanco, CTX, and Acyclovir in
   ED out of concern for meningitis, however, CSF clear. Liver/Gallbladder
   U/S ordered for reevaluation of ? stones/cholecystitis? - which is
   unlikely given normal LFTs.
   - D/Ced CTX, Acyclovir
   - Changed to zosyn from levo. ID consent pending.

   - cont Dilantin per Neuro
   - f/u Neuro recs:

   # UTI: Patient with UTI on UA.  Last UTI in [**3-23**] due to pan-sensitive
   Proteus. will treat with Cipro/Vanco for now.  Renal U/S ordered for
   evaluation of obstruction showed stones but NL urine flow.
   - Zosyn
   - f/u UCx. First set negative
   # Hypotension:  unclear etiology but concerning for sepsis given
   unresponsiveness to fluids boluses.  Other possible cause is propofol
   which was used for sedation, now on midazolam.
   - weaned from Levophed
   - 500cc IVF boluses PRN
   - monitor CVP
   - cont Abx as above for treatment of possible sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of quadriplegia and seizure disorder who presented with seizures. He has been on Keppra for seizure control and is currently experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by a positive urine analysis (UA). The patient has been treated with Vancomycin (Vanco), ceftriaxone (CTX), and acyclovir in the emergency department (ED) due to concerns for meningitis, although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear.

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure but fluctuating blood glucose levels. His respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with ABG values indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient has received infusions and other ICU medications as noted in the chart.

The physical examination reveals an unresponsive patient with not assessed peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, while other parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), creatinine (Cr), and electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. Seizures: The patient presents with typical seizures, which have been controlled for four years on Keppra. The patient has a confirmed UTI, which is likely the source of infection. The patient was given Vanco, CTX, and acyclovir"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 31 yom with history of MVA in Bolivia in [**2091**] with resultant
   quadriplegia s/p several VP shunts and seizure disorder who presents
   from home with seizures.
   # Seizures:  Patient presents with typical seizures which have been
   controlled for four years on Keppra.  Patient with +UTI on UA which is
   likely source of infection.  Patient given Vanco, CTX, and Acyclovir in
   ED out of concern for meningitis, however, CSF clear. Liver/Gallbladder
   U/S ordered for reevaluation of ? stones/cholecystitis? - which is
   unlikely given normal LFTs.
   - D/Ced CTX, Acyclovir
   - Changed to zosyn from levo. ID consent pending.
   - cont Keppra
   - cont Dilantin per Neuro
   - f/u Neuro recs:
   - f/u NS recs: get VP study Monday
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u UCx, BCx
   # UTI: Patient with UTI on UA.  Last UTI in [**3-23**] due to pan-sensitive
   Proteus. will treat with Cipro/Vanco for now.  Renal U/S ordered for
   evaluation of obstruction showed stones but NL urine flow.
   - Zosyn
   - f/u UCx. First set negative
   # Hypotension:  unclear etiology but concerning for sepsis given
   unresponsiveness to fluids boluses.  Other possible cause is propofol
   which was used for sedation, now on midazolam.
   - weaned from Levophed
   - 500cc IVF boluses PRN
   - monitor CVP
   - cont Abx as above for treatment of possible sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of quadriplegia, seizure disorder, and multiple VP shunts due to an MVA in Bolivia. He presents with typical seizures that have been controlled for four years on Keppra. The patient also has a positive urine culture indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is likely the source of infection. He was given Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir in the emergency department out of concern for meningitis; however, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is clear. A liver/gallbladder ultrasound has been ordered for reevaluation of possible stones/cholecystitis, but it is unlikely given normal liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient's seizures are being continued on Keppra, and Dilation will be continued as per neurology recommendations. The patient will follow up with neurology for further recommendations, including an EEG, and will also follow up with nursing staff for ventilator care and blood cultures. The patient's previous UTI in March 23rd was due to pan-sensitive Proteus, so he will be treated with Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin for now. A renal ultrasound has been ordered to evaluate for obstruction, but urine flow is normal.

The patient is experiencing hypotension with unclear etiology, but it is concerning for sepsis given the unresponsiveness to fluid"
