   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 yo female with history of polysubstance abuse,
   DM, admittied with hypoglycemia and [**Known lastname **] in the setting of cocaine
   abuse.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient found to be in respiratory distress
   upon arrival to the floor.  She was tachypneic to 40s with labored
   breathing and crackles diffusely on lung exam in setting of receiving
   4LNS in the ED.  CXR showed CHF, and she responded to lasix 10mg IV x
   1.  Now weaned to 6L NC, but still positive from yesterday.
   - lasix prn for SOB
   .
   2. [**Known lastname **].  Patient noted to have lateral ST depressions on admission
   which have resolved on arrival to floor.
   - continue aspirin
   - no BB given due to cocaine use
   - heparin drip until rule out complete
   - appreciate cardiology recs
   - verapamil for HR and BP control
   .
   3.  Substance abuse.  Patient tachycardic, hypertensive, with dilated
   pupils and febrile on admission, likely secondary to cocaine abuse.
   Now sedated after receiving ativan.  Also had ETOH in blood.
   - monitor with CIWA scale
   .
   3.  Hypoglycemia.  Likely secondary to decreased PO intake in the
   setting of unchanged insulin dose, cocaine abuse, and ?question of
   pneumonia.  FS initially in 200s, but fell to 20 overnight, so D5W was
   resumed.
   - q 1 hour fingersticks
   - stop D5W FS in 300s
   .
   4.  HTN.  BP currently improved after improvement of respiratory
   distress. Will avoid ativan due to somnolence.
   - verapamil prn for HTN
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Likely secondary to cocaine use or alcohol
   withdrawal.  Given [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] aim to keep HR in 80s.
   - verapamil PRN
   .
   6. Elevated lactate.  History of bowel ischemia with elevated, but no
   evidence of abdominal pain at present.  No evidence of sepsis at
   present.
   - re-check lactate
   .
   7.  ?Pneumonia.  Fever and productive cough per patient with question
   of infiltrate on CXR.  Got levo/ceftriaxone in ED.  Fever may have been
   in setting of cocaine intoxication.  Will monitor clinically for now
   and hold off on antibiotic as patient is without leukocytosis and
   prominent respiratory symptoms at presentation.
   - hold off on antibiotics for now
   - follow fever curve, WBC
   .
   8.  Fever.  Patient febrile to 102 in ED.  Concern for pneumonia versus
   cocaine abuse.  Received levaquin/ceftriaxone in ED for pneumonia, but
   infiltrate is unimpressive.  WIll send sputum, blood, urine cultures to
   evalaute for source of fever.  Patient does not have an elevated WBC.
   - monitor fever curve, wbc
   - f/u cultures
   .
   9.  CRI.  Patient Cr is improved from previous admission.  Baseline Cr
   of 2.0.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   10. DVT PPX: Heparin Drip.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is cocaine abuse. The patient received Lasix 10mg IV, which improved respiratory distress and allowed for weaning off the non-rebreather mask. Verapamil was given overnight for improved heart rate control. The patient was found to be hypoglycemic overnight, so D5W was resumed. 

The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, diabetes mellitus, and is currently admitted with hypoglycemia in the setting of cocaine abuse. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress - The patient was tachypneic with labored breathing and crackles diffusely on lung exam. A chest X-ray showed congestive heart failure, and the patient responded to Lasix 10mg IV. The patient is now weaned to 6 liters of nasal cannula but still positive from yesterday. Lasix is given as needed for shortness of breath.
2. [Last name] - The patient had lateral ST depressions on admission, which have resolved on arrival to the floor. Aspirin is continued, and no beta-blocker is given due to cocaine use. Heparin drip is continued until ruling out complete, and cardiology recommendations are appreciated. Verapamil is given for heart rate and blood pressure control.
3. Substance abuse - The patient is tachycardic, hypertensive, with dilated pupils and febrile on admission, likely"

   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient found to be in respiratory distress
   upon arrival to the floor.  She was tachypneic to 40s with labored
   breathing and crackles diffusely on lung exam in setting of receiving
   4LNS in the ED.  CXR showed CHF, and she responded to lasix 10mg IV x
   1.  Now weaned to 6L NC, but still positive from yesterday.
   - lasix prn for SOB

   3.  Substance abuse.  Patient tachycardic, hypertensive, with dilated
   pupils and febrile on admission, likely secondary to cocaine abuse.
   Now sedated after receiving ativan.  Also had ETOH in blood.
   - monitor with CIWA scale
   .
   3.  Hypoglycemia.  Likely secondary to decreased PO intake in the
   setting of unchanged insulin dose, cocaine abuse, and ?question of
   pneumonia.  FS initially in 200s, but fell to 20 overnight, so D5W was
   resumed.
   - q 1 hour fingersticks

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, diabetes mellitus, and admitted with hypoglycemia related to cocaine abuse. She presented with respiratory distress, chest X-ray showing congestive heart failure, and responded to lasix IV. The patient is currently on non-rebreather mask, weaned from 4LNS to 2L NC, and receiving oxygen therapy. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 148/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination revealed somnolence, normal airway, respirations, and cardiovascular status, crackles at the bases of both lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.7 K/uL, normal hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated blood glucose of 52 mg/dL, increased creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory distress possibly secondary to congestive heart failure, cocaine abuse, hypoglycemia, hypertension, substance abuse, and potential pneumonia. The plan includes continuing lasix for respiratory symptoms, weaning off oxygen, initiating oral ver"

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted with hypoglycemia and chest pain in the setting of cocaine abuse. On arrival to the floor, the patient was in respiratory distress and tachypneic, with crackles diffusely on lung exam. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed congestive heart failure (CHF), and she responded to lasix. The patient is currently weaned to 2L nasal cannula (NC) but still positive from yesterday. She has lateral ST depressions on admission, which have resolved. She is also febrile, tachycardic, hypertensive, with dilated pupils, likely secondary to cocaine abuse. Other findings include hypoglycemia, elevated lactate levels, and a question of pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with respiratory distress upon arrival to the floor, characterized by tachypnea and crackles on lung exam. She was treated with lasix and weaned to 2L NC but still positive from yesterday. This indicates possible fluid overload or heart failure, which can lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

   prominent respiratory symptoms at presentation.
   - hold off on antibiotics for now
   - follow fever curve, WBC
   .
   7.  Fever.  Patient with ongoing fevers.  Concern for pneumonia versus
   cocaine abuse.  Received levaquin/ceftriaxone in ED for pneumonia, but
   infiltrate is unimpressive so no further antibiotics given.  WIll send
   sputum, blood, urine cultures to evalaute for source of fever.  Patient
   does not have an elevated WBC.
   - monitor fever curve, wbc

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, diabetes mellitus (DM), and admitted with hypoglycemia in the setting of cocaine abuse. The patient's main medical issues include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, likely secondary to decreased oral intake, cocaine abuse, and potential pneumonia. Glucose levels have ranged from the 40s to 300s. The patient is currently on glargine and insulin sliding scale (ISS).
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to cocaine use or alcohol withdrawal. Verapamil has been initiated for heart rate and blood pressure control.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on nifedipine at home. Verapamil has been uptitrated for better control.
4. Fever: The patient has ongoing fevers, which may be due to pneumonia or cocaine abuse. Levo/ceftriaxone was given in the emergency department, but no further antibiotics have been administered. Cultures have been sent to evaluate the source of fever.
5. Potential pneumonia: The patient has a question of pneumonia, with fever and productive cough reported by the patient, as well as a possible infiltrate on the chest X-ray. However, there is no leukocytosis or prominent respiratory"
