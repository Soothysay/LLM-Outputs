   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o man with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and high
   likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.
   Respiratory failure
          It is not exactly clear what his parenchymal opacities
   represent.  He may have ARDS, community/nursing-home-acquired
   pneumonia, lymphangitic spread of tumor, or reactivation of
   tuberculosis (given right apical findings, foreign-born status,
   cachexia,
treatment-resistant
 pneumonia, and possible new relative
   immunosuppression from malignancy.
          Ventilation per ARDSnet strategy, although this is
   complicated by his emphysema.  At present, he has some dyssynchrony
   with the ventialtor and we will pursue additional sedation and try to
   match applied PEEP to instrinsic PEEP.  Remove extension tubing to
   decrease dead space.
   Pneumonia
          Although not clear that this is bacterial pneumonia, we will
   treat broadly for nursing-home-acquired pneumonia.
          Respiratory isolation and endotracheal aspirates for AFB x
   3.
   Possible malignancy
          Unable to safely bronch at present
 will check endotracheal
   aspirate for cytology
   Septic Shock
          Goal-directed therapy, but adjust CVP goal to ~15.  Use LR
   for resusctitive fluuid
          Measure noninvasive cardiac parameters with Vigileo.  If low
   CO, dobutamine
          Doesn
t meet criteria for steroids
          Would not pursue activated protein C while he is on heparin.
   Acidosis
          Mixed nongap metabolic and respiratory
 management as
   detailed above, including LR for further fluids
   Possible pulmonary embolism
          I doubt that the CT findings represent a PE as the major
   etiology of his respiratory failure.  Check LENIs and if no clot d/c
   heparin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and shock. He has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing hemodynamic resuscitation and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is complicated by a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and a new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to ARDS, community/nursing-home-acquired pneumonia, lymphangitic spread of tumor, or reactivation of tuberculosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have bacterial pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated to treat nursing-home-acquired pneumonia. Respiratory isolation should be maintained, and endotracheal aspirates should be collected for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing.
3. Possible malignancy: The CT scan findings indicate a right hilar mass with possible invasion of the central right bronchovascular bundle and complete obliteration of the bronchus intermedius. There is also a small filling defect in a right lower lobe segmental branch, which may represent a small non-occlusive embolism. Further evaluation with endotracheal aspirate cytology should be considered.
4. Septic shock: The patient is in septic shock, requiring goal-directed therapy. Adjustments to central"

   4 x 5cm rt hilar neoplasm causing marked compression and possible
   invasion of
   the central rt bronchovascular bundle and complete obliteration of the
   bronchus intermedius.  Addtional small filling defect is noted within a
   rll
   segmental branch which may represent a small non occlusive emboli.
   distal
   branches not evaluated due to motion which also obscures eval of lung
   parenchyma.  there is marked pneumonia/postobstructive pneumonitis of
   portion
   of the rll and rml.  marked bronchial wall thickening and scattred
   opacities
   with interstitial thickening which are likley infectious but can not
   exclude lymphangitic spread of tumor.  small b/l effusions with lt

   atelectasis.  severe emphysema.  Thyroid nodules.  probable b/l adrenal
   masses, not fully evaluated.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   - will also assess TTE to r/o cardiac cause of hypotension
   # ID

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer. He presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation and arterial lines. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's blood cultures were taken twice, and he has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Imaging results reveal a 4x5cm right hilar neoplasm causing compression and possible invasion of the central right bronchovascular bundle, as well as a small non-occlusive emboli in a right lower lobe segmental branch. There is also marked pneumonia and post-obstructive pneumonitis in the right middle lobe. Additionally, there are small bilateral effusions with left-sided compression atelectasis, severe emphysema, thyroid nodules, and probable bilateral adrenal masses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress into further respiratory failure due to the presence of lung collapse, post-obstructive pneumonia, non-obstructive infection, or ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's likely sepsis from post-pneumonia could worsen if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's resolved acute kidney injury may reoccur if"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   -          D/C HEPARIN
   -          Wean vent settings
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   # ID
   INFLUENAZA B
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   -          D/C HEPARIN
   -          Wean vent settings
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   # ID
   INFLUENAZA B
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,
   granulomatous findings on Chest CT.
   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3
   # Acid / Base status
   Resp acidosis w/ non gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to
   hyperchloremic met ac from liters of NS.
   Will convert resuscitation to LR and follow panel, abgs

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer presenting with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and possible lung collapse with a hilar mass. There is also a concern for tuberculosis (TB) given the patient's background and immunocompromised state.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's laboratory values reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal renal function.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of a right hilar mass with postobstructive atelectasis and probable postobstructive pneumonitis, as well as extensive interstitial thickening in both lungs. There is also a small nonobstructive thrombus in a branch of the pulmonary artery, which is likely postobstructive rather than embolic in nature.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, goal-directed therapy, and support for respiratory and hemodynamic instability. There is concern for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and worsening bibasilar infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a result of various direct or indirect lung injuries.

2. Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and the need for two pressors indicate ongoing shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the body's blood pressure is too low to sustain adequate perfusion to vital organs.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The presence of right hilar mass on the chest X-ray raises concern for a possible pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot that has traveled to the lungs and can lead to sudden blockage of blood flow.

4. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture positive for GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) suggests bacterial pneumonia, an infection in the lungs caused by bacteria.

5. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): Given the patient's presentation with fever, respiratory symptoms, and positive sputum culture, it is likely that the pneumonia is community-acquired.

6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an input of 7,428 mL and output of 1,185 mL over 24 hours, indicating a significant fluid overload,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and shock. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and a high likelihood of a new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to influenza, possibly with bacterial superinfection. He is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics, ventilation per ARDSnet strategy, and oxygen therapy. A complete MTB rule-out is planned, although it is less likely given the positive flu findings. The patient also has possible malignancy, septic shock, and possible pulmonary embolism. His current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures are in place for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a DNR code status and is currently critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to influenza, possibly with bacterial superinfection. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. Pulmonary malignancy: The patient has a high likelihood of a new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. This could potentially complicate his respiratory function and overall prognosis.
3. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. If not promptly and effectively managed, septic"
