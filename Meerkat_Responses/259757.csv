   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. female with CAD s/p 4 vessel CABG and follow-up stent of
   LIMA-LAD c/b instent stenosis with restenting as well as severe CHF, EF
   of 20-30% who presents after recent discharge with acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # CORONARIES: s/p CABG with stent of LIMA to LAD.
   - continue ASA, statin, Plavix, low dose BB.
   .
   # PUMP: Known, severe CHF, s/p ICD and recent admit to CCU requiring
   dobutamine. Followed by [**Doctor Last Name **] and transferred from floor for initiation
   of milrinone to augment diuresis. Other than peripheral edema and neck
   veins pt appears dry (climbing Cr, satting well on RA)
   - will place swan to assess fluid status. For now  on milrinone at
   0.75mcg/kg/min and furosemide 20mg/hr.
   - continue bblocker 6.5 [**Hospital1 **] while on milrinone
   - Monitor lytes with diuresis
   - Daily I&Os, weights
   .
   # RHYTHM: Episode of bradycardia in setting of CHB. Evaluated by EP and
   pacer settings changed
 no further episodes.
   - monitor on TELE, continue dig (level recently 1.3)
   .
   # Hypotension: Secondary to severe CHF. Patient is asymptomatic,
   mentating and making urine. Will initiate milrinone which could
   potentially worsen SVR and hypotension.
   - Consider vasopressin 0.04 mg/kg/min if drops BPs
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - Thigh cuff for BP measurements
   - Will hold Imdur, but continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine UP to 2.7.
   - Increased milrinone to increase renal perfusion
   - check urine lytes for feUrea
   .
   # Asthma
   - Continue Spiriva, albuterol, fluticasone
   - Satting well.
   .
   # Anemia/Myelodysplastic syndrome: At baseline
   - Will touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] (outpt hematologist) to reassess
   prognosis in setting of CHF for ? involvement of palliative care and ?
   need for inpt consult.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has a stent in the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD). The patient also has severe congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30% and presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient's recent events include not producing enough urine despite being on a Lasix drip, increased doses of milrinone, and administration of diuril. The patient also experienced bradycardia due to an unknown cause, which was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and pacer settings were changed to DDD with a heart rate in the 80s.

The patient complains of right elbow pain, and there are multiple areas of hyperpigmentation on her skin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, a current temperature of 35.7°C, a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/46 to 119/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters, and the patient is ventricularly paced.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,144 mL, including 189 mL of IV fluids"

The patient has hyperpigmentation on her skin, and her extremities show no edema or abnormalities in strength and sensation. Her pulses are bilaterally present and palpable.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels at 2.7 mg/dL, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels including sodium (Na+) at 135 mg"

","The patient is a 68-year-old African-American female with a history of coronary artery disease, post 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and subsequent stenting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery. She also has severe congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30% and presents after recent discharge with acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient's current medications include ASA, statin, Plavix, and low-dose beta-blocker. She is also on dobutamine and milrinone for heart failure, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for rhythm control. 

Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 99/46 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals general weakness, dry mucous membranes, peripheral edema, and multiple areas of hyperpigmentation. Laboratory results indicate acute-on-chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's plan of care includes weaning off milrinone, continuing beta-blockers, monitoring electrolytes with diuresis, and daily intake/output measurements. She is also on insulin for diabetes management and multivitamins. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further decline in renal function"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent bypass surgery (CABG) and received a stent in the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery. She also has severe congestive heart failure (CHF), an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, statin, Plavix, low-dose beta-blocker, digoxin, and insulin. She is also receiving IV milrinone to augment diuresis and has been rehydrated with normal saline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, CABG, stent placement, severe CHF, and low ejection fraction, she is at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even cardiac arrest.

2. Renal complications: The patient is experiencing acute-on-chronic renal failure, which may lead to worsening kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently receiving bronchodilators. She may be at risk for respiratory infections or exacerbations of her underlying lung condition.

4. Anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome: The patient has"

- The patient's medications include ASA, statin, Plavix, low-dose beta-blocker, lasix, spiriva, albuterol, fluticasone, insulin, and SC heparin.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 61-100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and heart rhythm of ventricular-paced.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 711 mL, with 290 mL given orally, 421 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 1,055 mL, including 290 mL of urine output. There is a negative fluid balance of -344 mL.
