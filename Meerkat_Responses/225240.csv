   #. EtOH withdrawal - Pt presented for detox from EtOH, has h/o DTs and
   withdrawal seizures. Is currently actively in DTs and likely suffered
   from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. Total Benzo requirements in the
   last 48hours include >250mg PO Valium and 6mg IV Ativan. The pt
   continued to become increasingly agitated on the floor, so was
   transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
   - Valium 10-20mg PO/IV Q1hr PRN CIWA
   - consider Ativan gtt if pt continues to require more frequent dosing
   of Valium
   - no Haldol for agitation give seizure yesterday, avoid polypharmacy
   - MVI / thiamine / folate

   #. Facial trauma - Pt p/w bruised left eye / ear, but unable to relay
   more information re: trauma. CT-scans showed multiple facial fractures,
   and pt was seen in ED by Plastic Surgery who felt that fractures were
   only operative for cosmetics and that the pt should f/u in 1 week for
   interval exam.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented for ethanol detoxification. He has experienced increasingly high and frequent benzodiazepine dosing, requiring closer monitoring in the MICU. The patient presented with delirium tremens (DTs) and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. Total benzodiazepine requirements in the last 48 hours include more than 250 mg of PO Valium and 6 mg IV Ativan. The patient continues to become increasingly agitated on the floor and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient is actively experiencing DTs and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. This condition requires close monitoring and continued administration of benzodiazepines to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.
2. Facial trauma: The patient has bruising around the left eye and ear, and CT scans showed multiple facial fractures. Plastic surgery has determined that the fractures are only operative for cosmetic reasons and recommended a follow-up examination in one week. Pain management should be provided, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of infection or worsening facial injuries.
3. Fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional management: The patient requires regular diet, IVF hydration, and electrolyte repletion. Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent dehydration, imbalances, and potential complications.
4. Prophylactic measures: The patient should"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old homeless man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital intoxicated with facial trauma. He has a history of delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. The patient received 250mg of oral Valium over the past 24 hours. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 167/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a protective lung strategy. He has a history of homelessness since 2014 and uses marijuana but does not use intravenous drugs. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth. On physical examination, the patient appears disheveled with bruising over the left face. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, but peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but movement and muscle tone assessments are not conducted.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9-5.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.3-32.5%, platelet count of 115-117 thousand/mm³, blood glucose of 111-98 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.5-0.6 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal limits. Other laboratory values are provided in the flow sheet.

Assessment and plan include continuing benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal, addressing hypovolemia with intravenous maintenance fluids, and pain management. The patient will remain in the ICU for continued care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient has a history of DTs, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms may lead to this potentially life-threatening condition characterized by severe agitation, fever, rapid heart rate, tremors, and seizures.
2. Seizure: The patient's history of seizures increases the risk of recurrent seizures, especially during alcohol withdrawal.
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if not prevented with appropriate prophylaxis.
5. Acute kidney injury: Hypotension, dehydration, or medications used in the ICU may contribute to acute kidney injury.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of alcohol abuse"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting for ethanol detoxification. The patient has experienced increasingly high and frequent benzodiazepine dosing, requiring closer monitoring in the MICU. He presented with symptoms of delirium tremens (DTs) and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/100 to 173/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examinations were not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is within normal range, while his liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. EtOH withdrawal - The patient requires close monitoring due to his history of DTs and withdrawal seizures. He has been taking high doses of benzodiazepines, exceeding 250mg of PO Valium and 6mg IV Ativan in the last 48 hours.
   - Administer Valium 10-20mg PO/IV every 1 hour as needed (CIWA).
   - Consider switching to IV Ativan if the patient continues to require frequent dosing of Valium.
   - Avoid using Haldol for agitation due to the recent seizure.
   - Provide multivitamins, thiamine, and folate.
   - Maintain IVF hydration with bolus and maintenance fluids.
   - Consult social worker for ethanol abuse and referral to stabilization units.
   - Administer Zofran as needed for nausea.
   - Apply nicotine patch.

2. Facial trauma - The patient has bruising around the left eye and ear, with multiple facial fractures seen on CT scans. The patient was evaluated by Plastic Surgery, who decided that the fractures were only operable for cosmetic purposes and recommended a follow-up examination in one week.
   - Hold Morphine and use Tylenol first if the patient complains of pain.
   - Follow up with Plastic Surgery in one week.

3. FEN - Provide regular diet, IVF hydration, and electrolyte repletion.

4. Access - Insert PIV line.

5. PPx - Administer SQ Heparin, H2-blocker, and bowel regimen as needed.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented for ethanol detoxification. He is currently experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) and has likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure. The patient required increasingly higher dosages of benzodiazepines (BZs) for agitation and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient has multiple facial fractures due to trauma, but the fractures are only operative for cosmetic reasons. The patient is advised to follow up with plastic surgery in one week.

The patient also has a feeding tube in place, and his diet consists of regular nutrition. He is receiving IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte repletion.

The patient has a peripherally inserted intravenous (PIV) line, and his pain management plan includes trying Tylenol before administering morphine. He is also on heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an H2-blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen as needed.

The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the MICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented for ethanol detoxification. The patient has been experiencing increasingly high and frequent benzodiazepine dosing, requiring closer monitoring in the MICU. The patient presented with signs of delirium tremens (DTs) and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. He continues to be agitated and is now in the ICU for closer monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening of alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient may experience further agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures due to ongoing alcohol withdrawal.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged bed rest, there is a risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid balance is currently negative, indicating potential dehydration. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further imbalances and ensure proper hydration.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are elevated, indicating possible liver injury or dysfunction. This can be associated with chronic alcohol abuse and may lead to hepatic encephalopathy or other complications.
5. Traumatic injuries: The patient has bruising around the left eye and ear, along with multiple facial fractures. These injuries may require surgical intervention or ongoing management for optimal healing and to prevent complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU for ETOH withdrawal. The patient has been receiving high doses of valium, which were later changed to IV ativan for a longer half-life. The patient is also on various other medications including heparin, nicotine patch, folate, and thiamine. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 146/96 to 173/116 mmHg. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.5°C, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 74.7 kg, and height is 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,772 mL, output of 1,900 mL, and a positive balance of 872 mL. The patient is not currently on respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears thin, has normal eye and conjunctival findings, normocephalic head, and clear breath sounds. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show absent pulses in both radial and distal pulses. Musculoskeletal examination does not show muscle wasting, and skin examination is not assessed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting for ethanol detoxification. The patient has experienced increasingly high and frequent benzodiazepine dosing, requiring closer monitoring in the MICU. The patient is actively experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. Total benzodiazepine requirements in the last 48 hours include more than 250 mg of PO Valium and 6 mg IV Ativan. The patient continues to become increasingly agitated on the floor and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal - The patient presented for detox from alcohol and has a history of delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures. Due to the patient's high and frequent benzodiazepine dosing, there is a potential for further complications related to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Facial trauma - The patient has bruising around the left eye and ear, indicating possible facial trauma. The CT scans showed multiple facial fractures. There is a potential for additional complications related to the facial trauma, such as infection or worsening of the fractures.
3. FEN (likely referring to food and enteral nutrition) - The patient requires regular diet and IV fluid hydration. There is a potential for complications related to nutrition and hydration, such as malnutrition or dehydration.
4. Access - The patient has a peripheral intravenous (PIV) line, which carries the"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of ETOH withdrawal. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. 

Vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate is 74 beats per minute with a range of 68-140 bpm, blood pressure is 146/96 mmHg with a range of 135-177/78-116 mmHg, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute with a range of 15-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of facial trauma with ecchymosis to the face, but no other significant medical history or review of systems is noted. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and warm skin, but the patient is unable to stand or move due to absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are mildly elevated, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. Blood glucose levels are stable, and kidney function is normal based on creatinine levels.

The patient's plan includes continuing ETOH withdrawal management, monitoring for facial trauma healing, and providing ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) abuse, who presented for EtOH detoxification. During admission, the patient experienced delirium tremens (DTs) and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, but is currently clear. Lorazepam has been used to manage withdrawal symptoms, with a decreasing requirement over the last 24 hours. Other medications include morphine sulfate, famotidine, nicotine patch, and Zofran for nausea. The patient also has facial trauma with multiple fractures, as shown on CT scans. The patient was seen by plastic surgery and will follow up in one week for an interval exam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55-60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120-139/67-80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), as well as slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient is currently hydrated with intravenous fluids and is receiving a regular diet. The plan includes social work consultation for EtOH abuse and referral to stabilization units, as well as follow-up with plastic surgery. The patient's code status is full code,"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse presenting for detoxification. He has a past medical history of DTs and withdrawal seizures. The patient is currently experiencing active DTs and likely suffered from a withdrawal seizure yesterday. He required an increased dosage of benzodiazepines for detoxification and was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient has multiple facial fractures due to trauma, as indicated by bruising around the left eye and ear. The plastic surgeon has decided that these fractures are only operable for cosmetic purposes and advised a follow-up examination in one week.

The patient is also being managed for facial nerve injury (FEN), regular diet, IV fluid hydration, and electrolyte repletion. He has peripheral vascular issues, with pulses not assessed in the right radial, left radial, right distal pulse (DP), and left DP.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/80 to 156/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His neurological examination is not fully assessed.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, lactic acid levels, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old individual with a chief complaint of ETOH withdrawal. The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and famotidine. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 142/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen. 

The patient has a history of head trauma and facial injuries. Physical examination reveals muscle wasting and an inability to stand. The patient's neurological examination is incomplete due to the absence of movement, tone assessment, and response evaluation. 

Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, there are slightly elevated liver enzyme levels and abnormal values for lactic acid, LDH, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. 

Plan:
The patient's plan includes continuous monitoring in the ICU, providing nutrition and glycemic control, administering prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and regular evaluation by a social worker. The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor once stable."
