   1.       Hypotension: Patient with hypotension without evidence of
   aortic dissection which was initial concern, does nto appear septic, or
   in frank cardiogenic shock, was he hypovolemic and on bblockers- had
   done well with some volume but then hypoxemic so got diuresed and then
   BP borderline.
   2.       Acute renal failure:  worrisome for ATN with low BP even at
   home (see OMR notes) and now got a dye load on top of it so we will
   need to watch BUN Cr and UOP closely.
   3.       HyperK: Rx with bicarn and Ca gluconate - Elevated serum
   potassium probably related to acidosis and low urine output. Improving
   with volume resuscitation. Acidosis has anion gap probably related to
   renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a hypotensive individual without evidence of aortic dissection, sepsis, or cardiogenic shock. They appear to be hypovolemic and are on beta-blockers. The patient has done well with some volume but then became hypoxemic, leading to the administration of diuretics and resulting in borderline blood pressure. The patient also has acute renal failure, with low urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to low blood pressure, even at home, and the recent dye load. Monitoring of BUN, Cr, and UOP is necessary. The patient has hyperkalemia, which is being treated with bicarbonate and calcium gluconate. Elevated serum potassium is likely related to acidosis and low urine output. It is improving with volume resuscitation. Acidosis has an anion gap, likely related to renal failure. The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm is stable. Respiratory distress was initially present after intravenous fluid administration last night, and the patient has a baseline COPD. This will be monitored as they stabilize. There is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but the images do not show proximal PE. Other issues remain as per housestaff.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately to ensure adequate organ perfusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Due to the patient's history of being on beta-blockers and having a systemic inflammatory response, there is a possibility of developing cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient does not appear septic, there is still a risk of developing septic shock due to his compromised immune system and potential infections.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's baseline COPD and recent hypoxemia after IVF may lead to respiratory distress, especially if his condition worsens or if he experiences any complications related to his respiratory system.
4. Acute respiratory failure: Given the patient's respiratory issues and potential complications, there is a possibility of acute respiratory failure if his respiratory function deteriorates further.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system makes him more susceptible to infections, which can further complicate his condition.
6. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient's recent imaging does not suggest a proximal pulmonary embolism, it cannot be completely ruled out. If a PE occurs, it can lead to severe respiratory complications.
7. Aortic dissection: Although the patient does not currently show signs of aortic dissection, it"

   admitted with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension - The patient has no evidence of aortic dissection on
   CTA. Exam demonstrated CVP of 20. Warm Extremities with good capillary
   refill. Given good perfusion and elevated CVP, cardiogenic or septic
   etiology made less likely. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. BP now
   improved to 110s. Pt had change in meds as outpatient ,with inc in home
   labetolol. Consider antihypertensive agents major contributor to low
   blood pressure. CE and ECG without evidence of acute ischemia .
   - Given elevated CVP will hold on further volume resuscitation, start
   gentle diuresis
   - Cycle CE, repeat ECG in am
   - Given history of night sweats/myalgias will send surveillance
   cultures, hold on antibiotics for now given low suspicion of infectious
   etiology
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 from baseline ~2 to 2.1 this am.
   Etiology may be prerenal/poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt high risk
   for contrast induced nephropathy following CTA. Now with worsening
   hypoxia following IVF. Got lasix, 40mg IV y/d to determine whether he
   could make urine.  Now receiving IV bicarb post contrast. FENA <1, able
   to conc urine, prerenal vs ATN picture-too early for contrast induced
   nephropathy.
   - Hold nephrotoxins, hold valsartan
   - Repeat UA/Ulytes
   - Renal Consult in am
   .
   # Hyperkalemia - elevated K in setting of renal failure. Given Ca and
   bicarb in ED. K improved to 4.5 iniitially, now 5.3. No ECG changes
   - Continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), renal artery stent (RAS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and compression fractures.

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension but does not show any evidence of aortic dissection on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The examination revealed a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20, warm extremities with good capillary refill, indicating adequate perfusion. Given these findings, a cardiogenic or septic cause for the hypotension is less likely. The patient's blood pressure has improved to the 110s. It is suggested that the patient's antihypertensive medications may be contributing to the low blood pressure. Therefore, it is recommended to hold further volume resuscitation and start gentle diuresis, repeat electrocardiogram (ECG) in the morning, and send surveillance cultures due to the patient's recent night sweats and myalgias.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from the baseline of 2.0 to 2.1 this morning. The etiology of acute renal failure may be pre-renal"

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE: Compared with the prior study of [**2200-2-19**], the inferior and
   inferolateral walls are much improved with very mild focal
   inferolateral hypokinesis. The overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal. The left ventricle is small and mildly

   with underfilling.
   Continued to have episodes of hypotension, intermittently requiring
   Levophed to keep SBP's above 90. CVP in evening was found to be 9. MV
   was 54 early in day. Later in day MV 70, gave 500ml IVF bolus, MV to 60
   post. No clinical change after bolus. Leveophed was restarted around
   midnight due to decreased MAPs.
   A-line placement attempted twice without success
   Renal consulted - acute on chornic renal failure is most likely due to
   pre-renal or ATN. Repeat urine lytes. Cannot rule out cholesterol
   emboli however not likely due to negative eos. No indication for

   Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine output, mental
   status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure is not

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4cm, renal artery stenosis (RAS) with a previously placed left renal stent, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. The patient was admitted with hypotension and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, requiring intermittent administration of Levophed to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) was initially 9 but increased to 18. The mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) was between 56-70%. The patient received a 500ml intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus without any clinical change, and Levophed was restarted around midnight due to decreased mean arterial pressures (MAPs).

A-line placement was attempted twice but unsuccessful. Renal consultation indicated that acute-on-chronic renal failure is most likely due to pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Repeat urine electrolytes were ordered, and the possibility of cholesterol emboli was considered but ruled out due to negative eosinophils. No indication for dialysis was present at this time.

   renal stent [**2195**], PVD, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) admitted with hypotension,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Hypotension- The patient has no evidence of aortic dissection on CTA.
   Initial exam demonstrated a CVP of 20, warm extremities with good
   capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Narrow
   pulse pressure. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. SBP to 110's.
   Patient had recent change in medications with increase in home
   labetalol.
   Very odd picture without clear etiology. [**Month (only) 60**] be that we are not
   accurately measuring BP. Not acting as if hypoperfusing.
   Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine output, mental
   status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure is not
   accurate, however, never had problems with measurements before. Did not
   respond to fluid challenge. Echo suggestive of fluid down without clear
   cardiac etiology. CVP appears increased today.
   - Trend CVP, lactate, MVO2
   - Consider femoral A-line for accurate pressures or monitor UOP, ext
   warm, mental status instead
   - Aggressive fluid challenge today to determine if cause of hypotension
 watch closely
 no levophed at time of challenge
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Follow up cultures - low suspicion of infection at this time.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 from baseline ~2 to 2.1 this am.
   Etiology may be prerenal/poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt high risk
   for contrast induced nephropathy following CTA. Now with worsening
   hypoxia following IVF. Got lasix, 40mg IV y/d to determine whether he
   could make urine.  Now receiving IV bicarb post contrast. FENA <1, able
   to conc urine, prerenal vs ATN picture-too early for contrast induced
   nephropathy. No indication for dialysis at this time. Renal consulted.
   - Trend BUN/Cr daily
   - Follow UOP
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   - Repeat UA/lytes
   - Follow up with renal
   - Follow up renal ultrasound
   .
   # AAA/Aortic Ulceration - stable per CTA. Vascular surgery following.
   CT surgery signed off.
   - BP goals normotensive but low
   - Will follow up as outpatient in 3 months with MRI
   .
   # Chronic Low Back Pain secondary to Compression Fractures
   - Monitor for changes in pain - AAA
   - Restart PO meds today

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4cm, renal artery stent, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. He was admitted with hypotension and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/47mmHg to 135/65mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 89%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination revealed a II/VI systolic murmur, no jugular venous distention, soft and nontender abdomen with positive bowel sounds, warm extremities with good capillary refill, and normal distal pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 166 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, sodium level of 105 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 49 mg/dL, creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 107 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a hypotensive and has acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 90/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals clear HEENT, a murmur, faint bibasilar rales in the chest, soft NT + BS in the abdomen, and no edema in the extremities. The patient is conversant and oriented. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine, troponin-T, lactic acid, and LDH. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except as noted above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension indicates ongoing instability in blood pressure regulation. This may be due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as fluid administration or vasopressors, are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels suggest impaired renal function. ARF"

   aortic dissection which was initial concern, does not appear septic, or
   in frank cardiogenic shock. Leading thoughts were he was hypovolemic
   and on bblockers- had done well with some volume but then hypoxemic so
   got diuresed and then BP borderline. No response to glucagon now. Echo
   looks underfilled. Give 2 L fluid challenge today and try to wean off
   pressors
   2.       Acute renal failure:  worrisome for ATN, cholesterol emboli,
   also low BP even at home (see OMR notes) and now got a dye load on top
   of it so we will need to watch BUN Cr and UOP closely

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and acute renal failure. He has a history of aortic aneurysm and chronic pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 90/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of mild facial swelling. Physical examination reveals a conversant patient with clear HEENT, cardiovascular examination showing a 2/6 systolic murmur and faint bibasilar rales, abdomen soft with normal bowel sounds, and no edema in the extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and BUN levels, as well as low potassium and sodium levels. The assessment and plan include hypotension (not in shock), pain control, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is stable, but he remains on pressors and will receive close monitoring of his BUN and creatinine levels. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, further deterioration of renal function, and possible development of deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization."

   3.       HyperK: Rx with bicarb and Ca gluconate - Elevated serum

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been hypotensive, with an initial concern of aortic dissection, but further evaluation suggests that the hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia and the use of beta-blockers. The patient's condition has been managed with volume resuscitation, norepinephrine infusion, and Levophed.

The patient's pain control is also a concern, as they are experiencing both acute and chronic pain. Additionally, the patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. The possible cause of ARF is thought to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which can occur due to low blood pressure, especially given the patient's history of hypertension.

The patient's electrolytes show hyperkalemia, which is being treated with bicarbonate and calcium gluconate. The elevated serum potassium is believed to be related to acidosis and low urine output, both of which are expected in renal failure.

There are no significant issues with abdominal aortic aneurysm, vascular problems, or respiratory distress at this time. The patient's respiratory distress was initially attributed to hypoxemia after intravenous fluid administration and their baseline COPD. However, it does not appear to be related to pulmonary embolism (PE), and further imaging is needed for confirmation.

The remaining issues to be addressed include ongoing ICU care, such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient remains hypotensive and an echo showed good left ventricular ejection fraction but possibly underfilled. SCVO2 was initially 54 on Levophed, then improved to 70% when Levophed was removed, and further improved to 70% after receiving 500 cc IV fluid. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, protonix, codeine, venomil honey bee venom, and Vicodin. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and receiving other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history remain unchanged except for the noted above. Review of systems is also unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygenation are stable. The patient has received blood products and fluids over the past 24 hours. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased kidney function with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Liver enzymes are within normal range, and electrolytes are mostly within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no cardiac injury. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. The patient"

   1.       Vasopressor requiring Hypotension: Patient with hypotension
   without evidence of aortic dissection which was initial concern, does
   not appear septic, or in frank cardiogenic shock. Leading thoughts were
   he was hypovolemic and on bblockers- had done well with some volume but
   then hypoxemic so got diuresed and then BP borderline. No response to
   glucagon now. Echo looks underfilled. Give 2 L fluid challenge today
   and try to wean off pressors- trend CVP and SCVO2
   2.       Acute renal failure:  worrisome for ATN, cholesterol emboli,
   also low BP even at home (see OMR notes) and now got a dye load on top
   of it so we will need to watch BUN Cr and UOP closely
 Cr trending
   down and making urine so may he may be getting into an ATN diuresis
   phase
 we will watch closely
   3.       Abd Aortic Anuerysm: stable

   renal stent [**2195**], PVD, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) admitted with hypotension,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Hypotension-The patient has no evidence of aortic dissection on CTA.
   Initial exam demonstrated a CVP of 20, warm extremities with good
   capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Narrow
   pulse pressure. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. SBP to 110's.
   Patient had recent change in medications with increase in home
   labetalol. Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine
   output, mental status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure
   is not accurate, however, never had problems with measurements before.
   Did not respond to fluid challenge y/d. Echo suggestive of fluid down
   without clear cardiac etiology.
   Weaned off lavephed y/d am. Maintaining MAPs off levophed 114-130S
   systolic, becoming borderline hypertensive. Bps felt inaccurate due to
   severe  vascular disease/ calcification, Got Fluid challenged to
   determine perfusion, mixed venous 02.
   Lactate, mixed venous 02, CVP stable.
   d/c trend
   Restart labetolol at 100mg TID to protect aorta from shearing forces.
   Continue to monitor HR/BP.
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 from baseline ~2.9 today
   resolving.
   Etiology: prerenal/poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt high risk for
   contrast induced nephropathy following CTA, with bicarb post contrast..
   Now with worsening hypoxia following IVF. Responded to lasix challenge.
   With good uop. Received IV bicarb post contrast. FENA <1, able to conc
   urine, prerenal vs ATN picture-too early for contrast induced
   nephropathy. Renal consulted and raised question of cholesterol emboli
   from severely atherosclerotic aorta to kidneys, thus C3/C4 ordered. C3
   wnl, C4 pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), renal artery stent placement, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented to the hospital with complaints of back pain while lifting something heavy, which radiated up his back and down his legs. The pain was described as dull but became sharp and radiating. Upon admission, he was hypotensive and in acute renal failure.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's blood pressure was managed with labetalol and later switched to a lower dose due to the potential risk of causing aortic dissection. He received a fluid challenge, and his CVP was maintained at around 15. The patient's pain was controlled with morphine, and he was monitored closely for any changes in vital signs.

Renal failure was initially suspected to be prerenal or due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). However, further evaluation ruled out contrast-induced nephropathy and cholesterol emboli to the kidneys. Renal consultation was sought, and the patient's renal function was trended daily with BUN/Cr. He was advised to follow up with renal recommendations and hold nephrotoxins.

The patient's AAA was stable per CTA, and vascular surgery consultation was obtained. An MRI follow-up in three months was planned. Additionally, the patient's chronic low back pain secondary"

   capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Narrow
   pulse pressure. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. SBP to 110's.
   Patient had recent change in medications with increase in home
   labetalol. Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine
   output, mental status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure
   is not accurate, however, never had problems with measurements before.
   Did not respond to fluid challenge y/d. Echo suggestive of fluid down
   without clear cardiac etiology.
   Weaned off lavephed y/d am. Maintaining MAPs off levophed 114-130S

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4cm, renal artery stent, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. He presented with complaints of back pain that radiated to his legs and worsened over time. He was admitted with hypotension and subsequently diagnosed with acute renal failure. The patient also has chronic low back pain secondary to compression fractures, anemia, and a history of allergies to penicillins, protonix, codeine, and venomil honey bee venom injection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which was initially managed with fluid resuscitation and later with the adjustment of medications. The cause of hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including possible aortic dissection, vascular disease, and medication effects. The patient's blood pressure has been stabilized, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from a baseline of 2.9 to 5.2, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to pre-renal factors such as poor perfusion leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is at high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy following a recent"

   renal stent [**2195**], PVD, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) admitted with hypotension,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Hypotension- The patient has no evidence of aortic dissection on CTA.
   Initial exam demonstrated a CVP of 20, warm extremities with good
   capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Narrow
   pulse pressure. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. SBP to 110's.
   Patient had recent change in medications with increase in home
   labetalol.
   Very odd picture without clear etiology. [**Month (only) 60**] be that we are not
   accurately measuring BP. Not acting as if hypoperfusing.
   Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine output, mental
   status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure is not
   accurate, however, never had problems with measurements before. Did not
   respond to fluid challenge. Echo suggestive of fluid down without clear
   cardiac etiology. CVP appears increased today.
   - Trend CVP, lactate, MVO2
   - Consider femoral A-line for accurate pressures or monitor UOP, ext
   warm, mental status instead
   - Aggressive fluid challenge today to determine if cause of hypotension
 watch closely
 no levophed at time of challenge
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Follow up cultures - low suspicion of infection at this time.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 from baseline ~2 to 2.1 this am.
   Etiology may be prerenal/poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt high risk
   for contrast induced nephropathy following CTA. Now with worsening
   hypoxia following IVF. Got lasix, 40mg IV y/d to determine whether he
   could make urine.  Now receiving IV bicarb post contrast. FENA <1, able
   to conc urine, prerenal vs ATN picture-too early for contrast induced
   nephropathy. No indication for dialysis at this time. Renal consulted.
   - Trend BUN/Cr daily
   - Follow UOP
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   - Repeat UA/lytes
   - Follow up with renal
   - Follow up renal ultrasound
   .
   # AAA/Aortic Ulceration - stable per CTA. Vascular surgery following.
   CT surgery signed off.
   - BP goals normotensive but low
   - Will follow up as outpatient in 3 months with MRI
   .
   # Chronic Low Back Pain secondary to Compression Fractures
   - Monitor for changes in pain - AAA
   - Restart PO meds today

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4 cm in diameter, renal artery stenosis with a previously placed left renal stent, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. The patient was admitted with hypotension and presented with complaints of back pain that started four days ago while lifting something heavy. The pain radiated up his back and down his legs and was increased in severity compared to his baseline.

The patient underwent an ultrasound, IV fluid challenge, and manual blood pressure monitoring. His vital signs were stable, and he was alert with good perfusion. The patient received morphine IV for pain management and was given Ambien for sleep. He experienced an episode of waking up slightly confused but was quickly reoriented by the nurse. The patient's oxygen saturation was off, and he was sleeping in short episodes.

The team believed that the patient was hypovolemic and subsequently bolused him with a total of three liters of IV fluids, which allowed for the weaning off of IV Levophed. The patient underwent both renal and abdominal AAA ultrasound procedures, with results pending. He continued to experience significant back pain issues throughout the day, with self-ratings varying from 2 to 10 out of 10. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), renal artery stenosis with a previous left renal stent, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with complaints of back pain, which radiated up his back and down his legs. The pain increased in severity compared to his baseline. He was admitted with hypotension and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, with no clear etiology. The blood pressure measurements might not be accurate, as indicated by the increased CVP and warm extremities. Further evaluation and monitoring are required to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from baseline 2.0 to 2.1, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal poor perfusion leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy following a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient is receiving IV lasix and bicarbonate, and renal consult has been obtained. Close monitoring of BUN/Cr, urine output, and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary.

3. AAA/Aortic Ulceration: The patient's AAA appears stable based on recent imaging."

   renal stent [**2195**], PVD, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) admitted with hypotension,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Hypotension- The patient has no evidence of aortic dissection on CTA.
   Initial exam demonstrated a CVP of 20, warm extremities with good
   capillary refill. CE and EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Narrow
   pulse pressure. No evidence of fever or leukocytosis. SBP to 110's.
   Patient had recent change in medications with increase in home
   labetalol.
   Very odd picture without clear etiology. [**Month (only) 60**] be that we are not
   accurately measuring BP. Not acting as if hypoperfusing.
   Despite hypotension patient has maintained good urine output, mental
   status and warm extremities...may be that blood pressure is not
   accurate, however, never had problems with measurements before. Did not
   respond to fluid challenge. Echo suggestive of fluid down without clear
   cardiac etiology. CVP appears increased today.
   - Trend CVP, lactate, MVO2
   - Consider femoral A-line for accurate pressures or monitor UOP, ext
   warm, mental status instead
   - Aggressive fluid challenge today to determine if cause of hypotension
 watch closely
 no levophed at time of challenge
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Follow up cultures - low suspicion of infection at this time.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr up to 5.2 from baseline ~2 to 2.1 this am.
   Etiology may be prerenal/poor perfusion leading to ATN. Pt high risk
   for contrast induced nephropathy following CTA. Now with worsening
   hypoxia following IVF. Got lasix, 40mg IV y/d to determine whether he
   could make urine.  Now receiving IV bicarb post contrast. FENA <1, able
   to conc urine, prerenal vs ATN picture-too early for contrast induced
   nephropathy. No indication for dialysis at this time. Renal consulted.
   - Trend BUN/Cr daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4 cm, right renal artery stent, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine level of 2.0. The patient presented with complaints of back pain that started four days ago while lifting something heavy, which radiated up his back and down his legs. He was admitted with hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/60 mmHg to 73/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination revealed no abnormalities in his peripheral vascular system or neurologic status. However, his abdominal ultrasound showed small atrophic right kidney and good size of the left kidney with high resistive indices but patent renal stent. The abdominal aorta could not be assessed due to the patient's raised body mass index.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (4.8 mg/dL), potassium (4.9 mEq/L), and lactic acid (0.7 mmol/L). Imaging studies revealed no relevant changes in the chest X"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.4cm, renal artery stenosis (RAS) post left renal stent, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. He was admitted with hypotension and presented with complaints of back pain that started four days ago while lifting something heavy. The pain radiated up his back and down his legs, increasing in severity compared to his baseline.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's vital signs were as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 61 bpm (59-74 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 114/60 mmHg (73-130/74 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (12-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula

The patient received a bolus of 4 liters intravenous fluid challenge and was alert with good perfusion and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15. He complained of dull back pain that became sharp and radiating. Two milligrams of intravenous morphine were administered.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, protonix, codeine, venomil"

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed in part to hypovolemia and
   predominately pharachological effects.  No evidence for aortic
   dissection.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HTN -- will need to resume anti-HTN medications sequentially, carefully
   monitoring of BP.
   HYPOXEMIA -- unclear etiology.  CXR unrevealing.  Consider COPD
   evaluation or sleep apnea evaluation.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia and hypotension (low
   flow).  Possible ATN, although .  Improved, non-oliguric.  Monitor UO,
   BUN, creatinine.  Avoid nephrotoxins.
   AORTIC ULCERATION
 ascending aorta.  Monitor.
   AAA -- stable.  Vascular Surgery following.  No indication for acute
   intervention
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- monitor.  Possible medication related.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient's past medical history, social history, and review of systems are all noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension but it has since resolved. Monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is recommended.

2. Hypoxemia: The cause of the patient's low oxygen levels is unclear. A chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormalities. Further evaluation for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or sleep apnea may be necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys may have suffered damage due to low blood flow caused by hypovolemia and hypotension. Monitoring urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is important. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided.

4. Aortic Ulceration: The patient has an ulceration in the ascending aorta. Close monitoring is required.

5. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): The patient has a stable AAA. Vascular surgery follow-up is planned, but there is no immediate need for intervention.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low. Medication-related causes should be considered, and monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed in part to hypovolemia and
   predominately pharachological effects.  No evidence for aortic
   dissection.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HTN -- will need to resume anti-HTN medications sequentially, carefully
   monitoring of BP.
   HYPOXEMIA -- unclear etiology.  CXR unrevealing.  Consider COPD
   evaluation or sleep apnea evaluation.  Monitor SaO2, maintain >90%
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to hypovolemia and hypotension (low
   flow).  Possible ATN, although .  Improved, non-oliguric.  Monitor UO,
   BUN, creatinine.  Avoid nephrotoxins.
   AORTIC ULCERATION
 ascending aorta.  Monitor.
   AAA -- stable.  Vascular Surgery following.  No indication for acute
   intervention
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- monitor.  Possible medication related.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient also has a history of back pain, but denies dyspnea. The patient has allergies to penicillins, protonix, codeine, venomil honey bee venom injection, and Vicodin. The patient's medical history includes hypertension that needs to be managed with medications, acute renal failure possibly due to hypovolemia and hypotension, an aortic ulceration in the ascending aorta, and a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications and is being monitored for several conditions, including hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/75 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, indicating a potential problem with oxygen delivery to the tissues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function. It is important to monitor urine output and"
