   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o M w/ no significant PMH presenting with acute posterior flail
   mitral leaflet.
   .
   # Acute Decompensated Heart Failure secondary to Acute Mitral
   Regurgitation, posterior flail leaflet:  Unclear etiology.  Currently
   HD stable, with IABP and no vasoactive agents.  LVEDP 40mmHg at the
   time of cath.  Etiologies can include papillary muscle rupture [**1-11**]
   ischemia (but patient has clean coronaries, so not likely), Acute
   Endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous
   changes.  The patient presented to the OSH with T 100.5F.  Echo at OSH
   reportedly showed no vegetations, however TEE would better assess for
   veggies given suspicion of acute MR.  Acute Staph Endocarditis can lead
   to acute MR given fast degeneration.  For now, will need to cover for
   endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent GI endoscopy
   involving three polypectomies.
   - TEE in AM to evaluate
   - continue diuresis w/o lasix if possible
   - continue vanc/CTX
   - Continue Heparin gtt for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis
   - Follow MAP > 60; if decreases will plan to start pressors and place
   CVL
   - Contact OSH for BCx
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs; may need dental consult pre-op

   # CORONARIES:  No flow limiting CAD on cardiac catheterization.
   Ischemia is not likely etiology of MR.

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia, likely appropriate compensatory response

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   I have reviewed admission history and physical and cardiac
   catheterization.  Course consistent with acute mitral valve
   regurgitation with pulmonary edema and hypotension. Has had essentialy
   negative coronary angiogram and IABP placement.
   Physical Examination
   Comfortable.
   JVP not elevated.
   [**2-12**] MR murmur.
   CXR: Pulmonary edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Significantly improved hemodynamics on IABP.  Mild hypotension stable
   off pressors. Oxygenation adequateand continues to diurese.  Plan also
   reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1038**] regarding timing of cardiac surgery.  Will
   plan TEE today to help exclude vegetation, although endocarditis seems
   unlikely explanation.  If remains hemodynamically and endocarditis
   unlikely will plan for mitral valve repair tomorrow. Continue IABP
   hemodynamic support.
   Critical care: 30 minutes due to unstable hemodynamics requiring IABP
   management.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant past medical history presenting with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet. The patient has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the mitral regurgitation is unclear, but potential causes include papillary muscle rupture, ischemia (although the patient has clean coronaries), acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient is receiving intravenous heparin and antibiotics for suspected endocarditis. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 182 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 109 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 109 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab results include normal potassium levels, slightly low sodium level, and normal magnesium and phosphate levels.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 364 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -986 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet. The patient has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the acute mitral regurgitation is unclear but could be due to papillary muscle rupture, ischemia (though the patient's clean coronaries make this less likely), acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes.

The patient's temperature is 100.5F, and an echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed no vegetations. However, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed in the morning to better assess for vegetations given the suspicion of acute mitral regurgitation. Acute Staph endocarditis can lead to fast degeneration and acute MR.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and no vasoactive agents. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is 40 mmHg. The patient has received vancomycin and ceftriaxone to cover for endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent gastrointestinal endoscopy involving three polypectomies.

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 182 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant past medical history presenting with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet. He has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the acute mitral regurgitation is unclear, but potential causes include papillary muscle rupture, ischemia (which is unlikely given clean coronaries), acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes. The patient presented with a temperature of 100.5F and an echo at OSH showed no vegetations, however, a transesophageal echo (TEE) will be performed in the morning to better assess for vegetations. Acute Staph endocarditis can lead to fast degeneration of the mitral valve and acute MR. The patient has been covered for endocarditis, including gram + and gram negatives due to recent gastrointestinal endoscopy involving three polypectomies.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and no vasoactive agents. His left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was 40mmHg at the time of catheterization. The plan includes continuing diuresis without lasix if possible, continuing vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and continuing heparin gtt for IABP thromboembol"

There are no obvious valvular vegetation, mass, or abscess seen. The patient continues to undergo diuresis with IV lasix.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a range of 81-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/50 mmHg to 110/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a range of 15-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's current weight is 76.8 kg, with an admission weight of 80 kg. The total fluid intake is 1,060 mL, including 120 mL of IV fluids. The patient has received 270 mL of oral intake, with 790 mL of IV fluids given. The total output includes 2,374 mL of blood products and 555 mL of urine output. The negative fluid balance is 1,314 mL.

24-hour events include a planned trip to the operating room (OR) for CT [Doctor First Name 91], a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealing partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation, and continued diuresis with intravenous (IV) lasix.

Allergies are documented, with the last doses of antibiotics given at [time]. The patient is currently on several infusions, including heparin sodium, and receives other ICU medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. Flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a slight variation in blood pressure. The patient's weight is currently 76.8 kg, with a slight decrease from admission weight of 80 kg.

Respiratory support is provided through a non-rebreather mask, maintaining an oxygen saturation level of 94%. Blood gases show a pH of 7.43, indicating a normal acid-base balance.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be alert and oriented, with no abnormalities noted in the general appearance. The neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP)"
