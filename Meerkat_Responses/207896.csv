","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, admitted with acute respiratory distress and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was found to have left lung collapse, and the cause is believed to be a left hilar lung mass encasing the left-sided bronchi. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy per IP recommendations, and coverage was provided for possible post-obstructive pneumonia with Vancomycin/Zosyn given the possible procedure in the morning.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with AC, TV 400, rate 10, FiO2 100%. If she experiences hemoptysis overnight, she will be positioned with her left side down to protect the right lung, and consideration will be given to right mainstem intubation. Lovenox has been held due to the low hematocrit (HCT) level of 20.

The patient's recent blood work showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.6, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 644, and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.5. Her blood cultures were drawn, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has multiple medical issues including hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, recent PEA arrest, anemia with unclear etiology, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hydronephrosis due to a poorly placed right ureter"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and intubated, and a left lung collapse was identified. A rigid bronchoscopy was performed, but stent placement was unsuccessful due to encasement of the left-sided bronchi by the lung mass. The patient has been on invasive ventilation with assist-control mode, tidal volume set at 350 mL, rate at 24 breaths per minute, and FiO2 at 50%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 133 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's left lung collapse has resulted in single lung ventilation, leading to potential respiratory failure. Further management may involve repeat ABG post-bronch debridement, consultation with Rad Onc for possible further management, and coverage for possible post-obstructive pneumonia with Vanc/Zosyn.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, likely post-obstructive pneumonia, and requirement for vasopressors suggest possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 400 x 10,
   PIP 24, and last gas with quite hypercarbia- since she has COPFD and is
   one lung vented ? autoPEEP and created Zone 1 lung. We will try smaller
   volume and slightly faster rate. Place A line for frequent ABGs and
   hemodynamics. If she bleeds needs left lung down, advance ETT into
   right mainstem and alert IP for urgent intervention. Could also try
   endobronchial blocker. We will cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post
   obstructive PNA esp with plans for intervention in AM.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   to be done. Cycle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks
   benefits can be assessed.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Will check stat
   head CT to look for blled (known mets). Serail Neuro exams throughout
   evening
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. The possible evolution of events suggests that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off the left mainstem, leading to respiratory distress and ultimately arrest from hypoxemia.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress due to left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood or pus. She is on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume (TV) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 24 cmH2O, and a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 29 cmH2O. The goal is to try a smaller TV and slightly faster rate. An arterial line has been placed for frequent arterial blood gases (ABGs) and hemodynamics.

If the patient bleeds, it is planned to perform a left lung down, advance endotracheal tube (ETT) into the right mainstem, and alert the intensivist for urgent intervention. An endobronchial blocker could also be attempted. The patient is being covered with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible post-obstructive pneumonia, especially with plans for intervention in the morning.

The patient also experienced a cardiac arrest, which seemed to be hypoxemic in nature, followed by bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The cardiac arrest resolved with brief epineph"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who experienced a hypoxic PEA arrest. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to left lung collapse, anemia, cardiac arrest, possible abdominal or retroperitoneal bleed, and a suspected pulmonary embolism.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's left lung collapse may lead to ongoing hypoxemic respiratory distress. If she experiences a re-bleed, immediate intervention such as lung deflation or advanced ETT placement into the right mainstem may be necessary. The risk of pneumonia due to post-obstructive changes should also be considered, and prophylactic antibiotics (Vanco Zosyn) have been initiated.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest resolved with brief epinephrine, atropine, and CPR. She is currently on Neo but weaning off. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65 and ensure adequate urine output (UOP) of 30cc/hr. A formal echocardiogram is pending to evaluate her cardiac function.

3. Anemia: The patient's initial anemia may have been spurious. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of blood loss, which could be related to gastrointestinal bleeding, blood in the chest, or"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and L lung collapse.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse with improved aeration s/p debridement. Pt with known left
   hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, now with
   collapse. Had rigid bronch yesterday but unable to stent LMS. Has had
   increased aeration since bronch by CXR. Tidal volume increased
   overnight with improved ABGs
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess, may have improved respirataory
   status after thoracentesis
   - Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn, F/U cx
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, Pressure support trials.  Will
   alter based on repeat ABGs
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   - Lasix 40 IV given for possibility of fluid overload contributing to
   respiratory distress and +multiple liters over hospital course
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - CE neg x 2
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt still requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Likely
   cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] with component of sepsis given hypokinetic dilated RV
   on Echo. Extremities clamped down. PE also possible given
   hypercoagulable state with malignancy, h/o [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]. Diagnosing PE,
   however, would not change management since needs anticoagulation anyway
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - monitor on telemetry
   - will attempt to diurese to optimize fluid status by starting lasix
   drip, following Is and Os
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   Rad Onc consulted and will follow. No treatment recommended at this
   time
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
 Will restart Lovenox tonight  given risk of having [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**] +/- PE and need to anticoagulate. We will resite line today
   and she had bronch and thoracentesis so ok to restart this evening
   - restart lovenox tonight

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has undergone several procedures including bronchoscopy, debridement, thoracentesis, and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/103 to 155/145 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient's medical history includes anemia, atrial fibrillation, COPD, hypertension, and hydronephrosis. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable with hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to left lung collapse and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and adjusting ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. Cardiogenic Shock/Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a dilated right ventricle with hypokinetic function on echocardiogram, indicating potential cardiogenic shock. There is also a suspicion of pulmonary embolism due to her hypercoagulable state with malignancy, but further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient requires multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting pressor support will be required.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT has dropped significantly, indicating anemia of unclear etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia and appropriate treatment.
5. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's malignancy and current immobilization, there is a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulation therapy should be restarted to prevent VTE.
6. Delirium/Sedation: The patient is heavily sedated and responsive only to voice commands, indicating potential delirium. Frequent assessments of mental status and gradual weaning off sedatives should be considered.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired infections due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression from cancer and medications. Cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient has received multiple liters of fluid over the hospital course, which may contribute to respiratory distress. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis will be necessary to prevent fluid overload."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and acute kidney injury. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy in the morning. An echocardiogram revealed a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function and preserved left ventricular systolic function compared to a prior study. The patient has been weaned off pressors and radiation therapy was deemed of little benefit. Allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides) and codeine. Antibiotics were administered including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient is receiving several infusions including midazolam, amiodarone, phenylephrine, and fentanyl. Other medications include famotidine, furosemide, and Lasix. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent events. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/103 to 105/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased total fluid input and output with positive fluid balance. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's critical condition. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased potassium and magnesium levels. Radiology images are attached. The patient's assessment includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition has not been determined.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right ventricular dysfunction: The dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function may indicate right ventricular failure or strain. This could lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels suggest acute kidney injury, which can worsen if fluid balance is not managed properly.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation but may still be at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
5. Bleeding: The elevated platelet count and use of anticoagulants like amiodarone increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding or coagulopathy is necessary.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which can be due to sepsis, right ventricular dysfunction, or other factors."

   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to left lung collapse and a known left hilar lung mass encasing the left-sided bronchi. This has resulted in decreased tidal volume and increased respiratory rate.

2. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia (PNA): Given the left lung collapse, the patient is at risk for developing post-obstructive pneumonia. The plan is to cover for this possibility with antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).

3. Sepsis: The patient has been requiring pressors since the PEA arrest, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This may indicate septic shock, especially considering the presence of fever and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.

4. Cardiogenic Shock: The PEA arrest could also be due to cardiogenic causes, such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), is planned to assess for any mechanical complications.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 11.5 g/dL to 10.1 g/dL, indicating anemia of unclear etiology. A CT abdomen and pelvis was negative for bleeding, but hemorrhage related to lung cancer and left lung collapse could be possible causes.

6. Atrial Fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. The possible evolution of events suggests that hemoptysis led to respiratory distress and ultimately arrest due to hypoxemia. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress due to left lung collapse, possibly with post-obstructive blood or pus. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with AC 350 x 24 and PIP 24, and her ventilation and oxygenation are acceptable. An attempt will be made to expand the left lung. The patient is also being covered with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to left lung collapse, which may be caused by a blocked airway with blood or pus. The blocked airway is leading to hypoxemic respiratory distress.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is currently stable, but it needs to be monitored closely as she is being anticoagulated.
3. Cardiac RV Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricular dysfunction is likely due to hypoxemic overload and possible pulmonary artery compression caused by the lung mass or a pulmonary embolism. The patient is being anticoagulated and diuretics are being used to unload the ventricle. Placement of a central venous line for central venous pressure (CVP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's arterial line stopped at 03:54 AM on 10/21/2144. The patient's radiation oncologist felt that there would be little benefit from additional XRT due to the patient having already received 60 Gy. The patient has allergies to sulfa, codeine, and an unknown allergen. The patient received Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin on 10/21/2144. 

The patient is currently on midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour, phenylephrine at 1 mcg/Kg/min, and fentanyl at 75 mcg/hour. The patient is also receiving Lasix and Pepcid. 

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/76 to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. 

The patient has received a total of 5,081 mL of IV fluids with an output of 620 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,461 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 90, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 90 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -25 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%. The patient's respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred due to hemodynamic instability. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and lab results. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 21.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 37.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 644 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.4 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.01 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 30 mmHg, blood glucose level of 103 mg/dL, and other lab values.

   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,

   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. The possible evolution of events suggests that hemoptysis (coughing up blood) occurred, leading to respiratory distress and ultimately arrest due to hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus. She is currently receiving appropriate ventilation and oxygenation, but if she experiences another bleed, she may require left lung deflation, advancement of the endotracheal tube into the right mainstem, and urgent intervention by the intensivist. Coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest that resolved with brief epinephrine, atropine, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She is currently on neosynephrine but is being weaned off. The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is between 60-65 mmHg, and maintaining urine output at 30cc/hr. A formal echocardiogram is pending.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable"

   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. The possible evolution of events suggests that hemoptysis led to respiratory distress and ultimately arrest due to hypoxemia. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, anemia, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. She is being treated with antibiotics and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and arrest indicate a risk of ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. If the patient re-bleeds, measures such as lung deflation and advanced ETT placement may be required.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which was resolved with brief epinephrine and CPR. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and hemodynamic parameters is essential to prevent future cardiac events.
3. Anemia: The patient's initial low Hct value suggests anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of blood loss, which could be from the gastrointestinal tract, chest, or other sites.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a suspected coagulopathy, as indicated by the presence of blood in the chest. Anti-coagulation needs to be carefully managed to prevent excessive bleeding.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient had a short downtime after cardiac arrest, and a preliminary head CT has been"
