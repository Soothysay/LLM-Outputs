   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 10165**] appears ready to extubate on minimal PSV/ CPAP support. He
   has needed atropine for symptomatic bradycardia. There are no new
   septic foci and I suspect acute decompensation is primarily cardiogenic
   given rapid turnaround. We will request Cardiology colleagues to advise
   regarding need for pacemaker/ AICD and med adjustment for ischemic CM
   and arrhythmia issues. We will restart lasix/ diuril today before
   extubation. We will also complete full antibiotics by am [**2178-9-1**].
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia. He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. The patient again presents with respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure - The patient is experiencing a rapid decline in respiratory status, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given worsening fluid on chest X-ray. This may be due to increased work of breathing, and the team is considering extubation later today. They will give Lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulmonary edema. Other measures include using albuterol and ipratropium inhalers, chest PT, and suctioning as possible.

2. Chronic systolic heart failure - The patient has an ejection fraction of 20% following a ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD placement. He had not been diuresed over the past 24 hours, and the team is considering calling cardiology for further evaluation of sick sinus syndrome and etiology of tenuous volume status. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) may be done"

   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -likely will need to restart lasix
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.

   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.

   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infection. The patient has been admitted multiple times for sepsis from a urinary source, complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. He presents with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema, less likely sepsis, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, or pneumonia. The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, post-VF arrest and ICD placement. He was not diuresed over the past 24 hours as the team thought he may be at his dry weight. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening fluid on the chest. He has intermittent fevers, although afebrile over the past 24 hours, with a significant jump in white blood cell count that resolved within 12 hours. A CT scan showed no evidence of abdominal or pelvic source, and there were no signs of osteomyelitis on X-ray. The patient underwent debridement on [date] with additional debridement on [date].

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia. The patient was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. He presents again with respiratory failure, likely due to flash pulmonary edema or increased work of breathing. The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% following ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD implantation/explantation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing a rapid decline in respiratory status, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given worsening fluid on chest X-ray, less likely sepsis, Clostridium difficile, or pneumonia. Ventilatory failure possibly due to increased work of breathing.
2. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD implantation/explantation. He has a low ejection fraction (EF 20%), and there is worsening of congestive symptoms.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -will give lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulm edema
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.
   - pan culture as above, f/u cultures
   -more likely cardiogenic shock rather than septic shock.
   -continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], Cipro, vanco for one more day; d/c flagyl b/c no
   evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.5
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   .
   #. Thrush - patient was started on nystatin mouth washes today for
   thrush
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, consider restart tube feeds if not extubating.
   -hyperkalemia - recheck labs, monitor EKG.
   #. PPx: INR therapeutic on coumadin
   #. ACCESS: PICC, will likely need central access and A-line today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest secondary to acute myocardial infarction with subsequent explanation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infections (BSI), admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure, and previous cardiac arrest.

The patient presents with acute respiratory failure, possibly flash pulmonary edema given worsening fluid on chest X-ray, less likely sepsis, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, or pneumonia. Ventilatory failure possibly due to increased work of breathing. The plan is to consider extubation later today, give lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulmonary edema, empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and metronidazole in addition to meropenem, blood, sputum, and urine cultures, and cdiff not sent.

The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% following ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD explanation. The patient had not been diuresed over the past 24 hours as the team thought he may be at his dry weight. CXR is worsening. The plan"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bloodstream infections.

The patient was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source, complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. The patient again presents with respiratory failure. The assessment and plan include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing a rapid decline in respiratory status, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given worsening fluid on chest X-ray. Ventilatory failure possibly due to increased work of breathing. The plan is to give lasix 60 mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulmonary edema, consider extubation later today, administer albuterol and ipratropium inhalers, and perform chest physical therapy and suctioning as possible.

2. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% following a ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD implantation/explantation. The patient was not diuresed over the past 24 hours as the team thought he"

   with vanc and meropenem, f/u cultures today and DC if negative.  Low
   suspicion for infection as cause of repiratory failure.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  Diuresed yesterday mid-day, running even since then.
   - Continue amiodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia, admission for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. The patient presented with respiratory failure again.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - likely cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume overload. The patient had a brief episode of hypotension after diuresis but improved with a small fluid bolus.
2. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) - with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% following ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD explantation. The patient was diuresed yesterday and is running even since then. He is currently on dopamine and will continue amiodarone and atorvastatin. Cardiology consulted yesterday and recommended starting beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor when condition allows. Transfer to [Hospital1] service when stable, currently no indication for pacemaker/AICD placement.
3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia). The patient remains afebrile, and temperatures will continue to be followed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure - Currently doing well on room air.  Fluid
   goal 500cc negative today.  D/C antibiotics
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - Fluid managment as above
   # Pseudomanas UTI: completed 14 day course of meropenem
   #. Leg Ulcer - Wound vac - vascular follow

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infections, admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure but is currently doing well on room air. Fluid goal is set at 500cc negative for the day, and antibiotics have been discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently weaned off dopamine. There is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF, and fluid management is crucial to prevent worsening of symptoms.
3. Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had completed a 14-day course of meropenem for pseudomanas UTI. There is a risk of recurrent infection if proper hygiene and antibiotic prophylaxis are not followed.
4. Leg ulcer: The patient has a leg ulcer that requires wound vacuum therapy and vascular follow-up. There is a risk of infection and non-healing of the ulcer.
5. Deep vein thrombosis"
