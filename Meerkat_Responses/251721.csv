","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure (CHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath and fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/43 mmHg to 160/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a 2L nasal cannula.

The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and experienced lightheadedness, which resolved with a 500cc bolus. She continues to be on vancomycin qHD protocol. Blood cultures were taken and showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient is awaiting a bed on the floor.

The patient's allergies include Dyazide, Prozac, NSAIDs, Inderal, and cefazolin. The last dose of antibiotics was on [**2173-12-22**] at 06:39 PM. Other medications include infusions and various ICU medications. There are no changes to her medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. Physical examination reveals"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post renal transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted with fluid overload and fevers.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's dyspnea improved after hemodialysis (HD) on December 22nd. However, she continues to experience oxygen weaning issues, and a chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. Her hypertension crisis has also improved following HD on December 22nd, and she will continue taking metoprolol and an ACE inhibitor.

The patient was diagnosed with bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci and is being treated with vancomycin. Levofloxacin has been discontinued as the source of infection has been identified. Blood cultures are being followed up.

The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week but still produces some urine. She will continue to receive renal recommendations and immunosuppression with prednisone and tacrolimus, with regular monitoring of tacrolimus levels. Nephrocaps and Bactrim prophylaxis will also be continued.

She has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, and treatment includes beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on NPH and SSI insulin, following a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (dyspnea). The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension (malignant), fever with positive GPC in blood, end-stage renal failure (ESRD), chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, indicating a fever. Blood pressure is unstable, ranging from 101/41 mmHg to 160/54 mmHg. Heart rate is within normal range at 68 bpm. Respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, suggesting potential peripheral arterial disease or peripheral vascular disease. The patient's abdomen is soft, but there is muscle wasting noted. Neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient not being assessed for movement, tone, and orientation.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count of 254 K/uL. Creatinine level is elevated at 6.2 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction. Troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, suggesting possible myocardial injury. Other lab results indicate hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and dyspnea. She is on hemodialysis and is immunosuppressed due to medication for her renal transplant. Her medical history includes hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. She has been treated with vancomycin for the bacteremia, and her AV graft ultrasound shows no evidence of infection or clot. The patient's fever has resolved with treatment, and her dyspnea was likely due to acute sepsis causing transient demand ischemia. She also had malignant hypertension, which has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Although no source of infection has been identified, precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) should be continued pending sensitivities. Monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of heart failure and coronary artery disease. The dyspnea may have been related to acute sepsis causing transient demand ischemia, leading to a stiff ventricle. Close monitoring of cardiac function and ongoing management of her cardiac conditions are essential.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires ongoing hemodialysis. Regular assessment of renal function and"

","The patient is a 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease who underwent a renal transplant and is currently on maintenance hemodialysis. She was admitted to the ICU with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and dyspnea. Her fever has resolved, and she no longer feels chilled. She denies congestion, sore throat, chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 145/90 mmHg to 165/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her blood cultures are growing staphylococcus aureus, and sensitivities are pending. She is on vancomycin and will continue to have her trough levels checked prior to dialysis. The ultrasound of her AV graft showed no evidence of infection or clot. Her urine output has been 58 mL, and her fluid balance is positive at 592 mL. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, malignant; end-stage renal disease; heart failure, diastolic, chronic; diabetes mellitus, type II; and coronary artery disease. Her current medications include metoprolol, ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). 

The patient has a history of chronic diseases including heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis. 

Upon examination, the patient is overweight/obese, with normal perfusion and oxygenation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/50 mmHg to 165/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), suggesting renal impairment. The patient's glucose level is also elevated at 185 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no acute cardiac injury.
