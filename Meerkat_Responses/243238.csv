   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, chronic atrial systole (AS), and inferior myocardial infarction from ongoing shower activities. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain.

The patient initially presented with ST-elevation on the electrocardiogram (EKG) by emergency medical services (EMS), but these findings have since resolved. However, the patient experienced one episode of chest pain yesterday morning. Given the repeated nature of chest pain, it is advisable to proceed with cardiac catheterization.

The plan includes:
1. Cardiac catheterization today.
2. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) after catheterization this morning.
3. Administration of aspirin 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg (as the patient is unlikely to be a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to age and severe AS).
4. No need for further anticoagulation as the patient received enoxaparin in the outpatient setting for 48 hours.
5. Monitor for chest pain, and if not resolved with morphine, use low-dose nitroglycerin (NTG) as needed.
6. Perform EKG in the morning.
7. Start atorvastatin 80 mg and lisinopril 5 mg daily.
8. Up-titrate metoprolol to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial septal defect (AS), atrial fibrillation (AF), and a recent inferior myocardial infarction (MI) from outside the hospital. The patient was initially brought in with ST-elevation on the electrocardiogram (EKG) but has since resolved. She experienced one episode of chest pain (CP) yesterday morning. Given the repeated nature of the chest pain, it is recommended to proceed with cardiac catheterization.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm) in AF rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 134/69 to 137/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (insp/min), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and the patient's respiratory effort is unlabored without accessory muscle use. Decreased breath sounds are present in the bases bilaterally with scant crackles. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with no hepatojugular reflux or abdominal bruits. Extremities show no clubbing, edema, or femoral bruits. The skin is intact without stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 and 7.5 thousand cells/mm³ on two separate occasions, hemoglobin of 39.0 and 38.2 g/dL, platelet count of 238 and 201 thousand cells/mm³, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.95 ng/mL, glucose level of 121 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

The patient's plan includes cardiac catheterization today, followed by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) after the catheterization. The patient will also be started on aspirin 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg due to her severe AS and age. No further anticoagulation is needed as the patient received enoxaparin in the outside hospital for 48 hours. She should be monitored for chest pain, and if not resolved with morphine, low-dose nitroglycerin (NTG) can be given cautiously due to her AS. An EKG will be done in the morning. The patient will also be started on atorvastatin 80 mg, lisinopril 5 mg daily, and metoprolol 75 mg up titrated to a heart rate less than 70 bpm.

Other plans include monitoring for signs of fluid overload or flash pulmonary edema and providing furosemide as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, presenting with an inferior myocardial infarction. She is currently stable and chest pain-free. The plan is to proceed with cardiac catheterization, followed by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) after the procedure. Medications include aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. The patient has no signs of fluid overload but has a history of flash pulmonary edema. Her atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled on atenolol, and she has a CHADS2 score of 3. She also has hypertension and macular degeneration. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reinfarction or extension of the current myocardial infarction during or after cardiac catheterization.
2. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing ischemia or complications from the procedure.
3. Development of heart failure or worsening of existing heart failure symptoms.
4. Arrhythmias, including recurrent atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias.
5. Bleeding complications related to anticoagulation therapy.
6. Contrast-induced nephropathy due to exposure to iodinated contrast during the catheterization.
7. Pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, presenting with an inferior myocardial infarction. The patient is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable without any chest pain or shortness of breath.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with an irregularly irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 134/69 mmHg to 137/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

The physical examination reveals a harsh III/VI crescendo decresendo systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, decreased breath sounds in the bases with scant crackles, and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and troponin T levels. The remaining lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include cardiac catheterization due to the repeated nature of chest pain, along with medications such as aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and ranitidine. Fluid management and monitoring for flash pulmonary edema are also mentioned. The patient's rhythm control includes monitoring on telemetry and possible start of war"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, presenting with an inferior myocardial infarction. She initially had ST-elevation on EKG but it has since resolved. She experienced one episode of chest pain yesterday morning. Due to the repeated nature of her chest pain, it is advisable to proceed with cardiac catheterization.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain. She has been started on aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 134/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Her physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm with no thrills or lifts, and a harsh crescendo decresendo systolic murmur radiating to the carotids. There are decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally with scant crackles. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits. Her extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Her skin is intact and free of lesions.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.95. Her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes cardiac catheterization today, followed by a transthoracic echocardiogram in the morning. She will continue to be monitored for chest pain, and low-dose nitroglycerin will be used if necessary. An EKG will be obtained in the morning. She will also be started on atorvastatin, lisinopril, and metoprolol, with the goal of achieving a heart rate below 70 bpm. 

The patient's rhythm will be monitored on telemetry, and she will be repleted with electrolytes as needed. She is likely to start warfarin after the procedure. Her hypertension is stable and currently normotensive, and she will continue on metoprolol. Her GERD is stable, and pantoprazole will be held due to an interaction with clopidogrel. Ranitidine will be started instead. Her macular degeneration is stable, and she will continue on prednisolone.

The patient's access lines include PIVs. She will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis with subcutaneous heparin, pain management with Tylenol, and bowel regimen with Colace/Senna. Her code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and inferior myocardial infarction, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction during or after the cardiac catheterization procedure.

2. Bleeding complications: The patient is on multiple anticoagulant medications, including enoxaparin, aspirin, and Plavix, which increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful management of anticoagulation therapy will be necessary.

3. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or hospitalization. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in certain situations.

4. Renal complications: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the potential for contrast-induced nephropathy from the use of iodinated contrast during the cardiac catheterization.

5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be monitored closely, especially given her history of flash pulmonary edema. There is a risk of further respiratory distress or pneumonia during her hospital stay"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, presenting with inferior myocardial infarction. She underwent cardiac catheterization and received stents in the right coronary artery. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable without chest pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reinfarction: Given the repeated nature of chest pain, there is a potential risk of reinfarction.
2. Heart Failure: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema in the outpatient setting. Therefore, monitoring for signs of fluid overload and prompt diuresis is necessary.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may persist or recur. Close monitoring on telemetry is required, and anticoagulation with warfarin should be considered after cardiac catheterization.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, ongoing monitoring is essential due to her history of hypertension.
5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's GERD is stable, but ranitidine should be used instead of pantoprazole due to the interaction with clopidogrel.
6. Macular Degeneration: The patient has stable macular degeneration, and continued use of prednisolone is recommended.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), presenting with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently hemodynamically stable without any complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or jaw pain. The patient had a previous episode of chest pain yesterday morning but has been chest pain-free since then. Her EKG showed resolved ST-elevations. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). A stent was placed in the distal RCA due to 90% stenosis. The patient received ASA 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg post-catheterization. She is being monitored for chest pain and will be given morphine if necessary. An EKG will be performed in the morning. The patient is also on atorvastatin 80 mg, lisinopril 5 mg daily, and metoprolol 75 mg up titrated to a heart rate below 70. The patient has no signs of fluid overload but had a previous episode of flash pulmonary edema in the emergency department. She is currently diuresing well and is normotensive. Her other medical conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), macular degeneration, and hypertension. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with inferior myocardial infarction (MI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent in the distal RCA due to 90% stenosis. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has 3-vessel CAD, which increases the risk of recurrent MI or ischemic heart disease.
2. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient's pre-existing AS can worsen over time and may lead to symptoms such as syncope or heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF needs to be managed to maintain rate control and prevent thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
4. Potential bleeding complications: Given the use of anticoagulant medications, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored and managed to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has a history of GERD, and appropriate management is necessary to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
7. Macular degeneration: The patient has a history of macular degeneration, and it should be monitored and managed accordingly.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), who presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) secondary to ongoing chest pain. She initially had ST-elevation on the EKG, but it has since resolved. She had one episode of chest pain yesterday morning and underwent cardiac catheterization due to the repeated nature of her chest pain.

During the cardiac catheterization, it was found that she had three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). A stent was placed in the mid-distal RCA due to 90% stenosis, and final angiography showed normal flow with resolution of the dissection and no residual stenosis.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. She is on aspirin 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg. No further anticoagulation is required as she received enoxaparin in the outpatient setting for 48 hours.

She is being monitored for any signs of chest pain, and if not resolved with morphine, low-dose nitroglycerin will be used cautiously due to her aortic stenosis. An EKG will be performed in the morning. She is also prescribed atorvastatin 80 mg, lisinopril 5 mg daily, and metoprolol 75 mg titrated up to a heart rate of less than 70 bpm.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), who presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) due to occlusion in the distal right coronary artery (RCA). She underwent cardiac catheterization, where a stent was placed, resulting in normal flow, resolution of the dissection, and no residual stenosis.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, free of chest pain, and responding well to diuretics. Her vital signs are within normal limits, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. She is on prophylactic ranitidine, heparin sodium, and aspirin. Other medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol (up-titrated to maintain heart rate below 70 bpm), and topical prednisolone for macular degeneration.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. However, her potassium level is slightly elevated at 5.8 mEq/L. Her troponin-T levels are decreasing, indicating improvement.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for any chest pain, which may be managed with morphine and nitroglycerin if necessary. An EKG will be obtained in the morning. The patient is also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), who presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) after undergoing cardiac catheterization. She has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the mid-distal right coronary artery (RCA) due to 90% stenosis. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 87/67 mmHg and a heart rate of 79 beats per minute (bpm). She is on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, enoxaparin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, furosemide, ranitidine, and tylenol for pain management. She has no signs of fluid overload and is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of AS and AF, as well as recent inferior MI, there is a potential risk of further cardiac complications such as recurrent chest pain, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is on multiple anticoagulant medications (enoxaparin, Plavix), which increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if there are any signs of internal bleeding or if the INR levels become excessively high.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was started on ranitidine and heparin sodium prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for an elevated blood pressure reading of 87/67 mmHg. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation level of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2246 mL with 750 mL given orally, 1496 mL infused intravenously, and 400 mL given as blood products. The total output is 2402 mL, including 450 mL of urine output. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 76.4 kg.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there is a slight elevation in creatinine levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal limits, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction. Other lab values such as electrolytes and liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 99%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unconscious state, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF). She presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) and was found to have three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) during cardiac catheterization. A stent was placed in the mid-distal right coronary artery (RCA), and there were no residual stenosis or dissection observed. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently hemodynamically stable without chest pain. She is on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, ranitidine, and heparin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of AS and recent MI, she is at risk for further cardiac events such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or recurrent MI.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and antiplatelet therapy with Plavix, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Renal complications: The patient's fluctuating blood pressures and use of diuretics may impact renal function, leading to acute kidney injury.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema in the past, so there is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress or pneumonia.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (AF), and angina who presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) after undergoing cardiac catheterization. She initially had ST-elevation on the EKG but it has since resolved. She experienced one episode of chest pain yesterday morning. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and angiography which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). A stent was placed in the mid-distal right coronary artery (RCA) due to 90% stenosis, and there was also 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, as well as distal occlusion in the left circumflex (LCX) artery. 

After the procedure, the patient's vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 87/67 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. 

On physical examination, the patient was conversant, oriented, and appropriate in mood and affect. No pallor, cyanosis, or xanthalesma was noted. The neck was supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) below the clavicle. The patient had an irregularly irregular rhythm, S2, and a harsh III/VI crescendo-dec"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ PMH of AS, AF p/w inferior MI from OSH for cath. She is
   currently hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.
   # CORONARIES: Patient initially with STEs on ekg by EMS, but have
   resolved since. She has had one episode of CP yesterday AM. Given the
   repeated nature of chest pain, it is wise to proceed with cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Cathed yesterday-  Initial angiography showed 3 vessel CAD.  1.  90%
   stenosis in distal RCA  2.  80% stenosis in LAD.  3.  LCX had distal
   occlusion.  Stent placed in mid-distal RCA.  Final angiography showed
   normal flow, resolution of the dissection and no residual stenosis.
   -TTE today to evaluate EF given fluctuating BPs this AM
   - Asa 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg (as patient is not likely a candidate for
   CABG, given her age and severe AS)
   - No need for further anticoagulation as patient received enoxaparin in
   OSH for 48 hour duration.
   - Monitor for CP, if not resolved with morphine, low dose NTG
   gtt...must be careful with AS.
   - EKG in AM
   - Atorvastatin 80, Lisinopril 5 mg daily
   - metoprolol 75 [**Hospital1 **] up titrate to HR < 70
   # PUMP: Patient with no signs of fluid overload. Patient w/report of
   flash pulmonary edema in OSH with CP. Resolved with diuresis.
   - Fluctuating BPs overnight and this AM- will get TTE today
   - Got lasix 40mg x 1 last night after cath- put out 1.2 L.  Decreased
   UOP this AM.  Will monitor her this morning before giving her lasix
   again.
   - Furosemide prn for s/sx of fluid overload/flash
   .
   # RHYTHM: H/O of atrial fibrillation rate controlled on atenolol.
   Currently in NSR. CHADS2 score 3.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Replete lytes prn
   - consider starting warfarin- will discuss with PCP
   .
   # Hypertension: Stable, currently normotensive
   - Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider decreasing dose to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] if pressures are too low
   .
   # GERD: Stable
   - Hold pantoprazole given interaction with clopidogrel.
   - On Ranitidine
   # Macular Degneration: Stable
   - Continue prenisololone 1% 5 mL OS [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), presenting with inferior myocardial infarction (MI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent in the mid-distal RCA due to 90% stenosis. Her current condition is stable with no chest pain or shortness of breath. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and her physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her laboratory results are also within normal ranges. The patient is prescribed aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and metoprolol for her condition. She is being closely monitored for any signs of fluid overload or flash pulmonary edema, given her previous episode. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent chest pain or myocardial infarction due to residual CAD or stent thrombosis.
2. Development of heart failure or worsening of existing heart failure symptoms.
3. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.
4. Stroke, particularly given her CHADS2 score of 3.
5. Bleeding complications from anticoagulation therapy.
6. Infection or sepsis due to immunosuppression.
7. Kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
8. Malnutrition or poor nutritional intake.
9. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
