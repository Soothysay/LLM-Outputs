","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia and coffee ground emesis. The initial assessment suggested a possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and his secretions were suctioned. He was extubated yesterday.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, high blood pressure ranging from 160s, and a heart rate of 98 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient continues to have multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and his hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing (from 41.3 to 33.5).

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The urine chemistry shows high urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.44%. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Possible CAP or aspiration pneumonitis: Continue antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin), follow-up cultures, and narrow antibiotics as soon as appropriate.

2. Coffee ground"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis on top of tenuous respiratory status secondary to a URI (upper respiratory infection). He presented hypoxic with coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of stroke in 1999, and his current medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and possibly an ulcer with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high blood pressure and PVCs (premature ventricular contractions). He is currently extubated and has been experiencing multiple secretions, which have been suctioned. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray, and sputum cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxia and respiratory failure indicates a high risk for continued respiratory complications.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and aspiration, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of coffee ground emesis suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypotension and further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, but there is a risk of hypotension due to fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of polys in their sputum culture. This infection may worsen and lead to further respiratory distress if not properly treated.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient exhibits signs of pulmonary edema, such as difficulty swallowing, progressive shortness of breath, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and crackles in both lungs. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.

3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings throughout the day indicate a potential underlying hypertension issue. If left uncontrolled, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has a history of diabetes type II. Poor glycemic control can lead to various complications, including infections, kidney damage, and cardiovascular problems.

5. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): Although the patient's hematemesis is not significant, there is still a possibility of ongoing or future gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of re-bleeding and appropriate management is essential.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin have been initiated.

   Imaging: CXR:
   ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most
   consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2184-11-1**], the right ventricle is mildly dilated,
   hypertrophic and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is
   detected.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). The patient's initial condition improved with IV fluids and nitro drip, but subsequently developed tachycardia, tachypnea, and worsening secretions, leading to intubation. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DMII, and fluid electrolyte imbalance. The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions and is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure if not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonitis.
3. Coffee ground emesis: Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of coffee ground emesis, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or hemoptysis from pneumonia.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and there is a risk of exacerbation of renal insufficiency if not managed appropriately"

   Imaging: CXR:
   ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most
   consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2184-11-1**], the right ventricle is mildly dilated,
   hypertrophic and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is
   detected.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a history of upper respiratory infection (URI). He has been experiencing progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and falls under the category of polypharmacy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and hypotension indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis. Broadening antibiotic coverage to include anaerobes is recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory decline requiring intubation suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously.
3. Coffee Ground Emesis: The presence of coffee ground emesis may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or hemoptysis due to pneumonia. Upper endoscopy was negative, but further investigation is needed to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency. Poor urine output and hypotension may suggest prerenal azotemia. IV fluid bolus has been given, and urine electrolytes should be monitored.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently controlled with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with respiratory failure, shock (likely septic), acute renal failure, and a GI bleed (now quiescent). The source of infection is most likely pulmonary, and there was a clinical impression of aspiration. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover nosocomial respiratory pathogens while awaiting cultures. If the cultures are negative in 4-7 days, the antibiotics may be discontinued or narrowed.

The patient has been weaned off of pressors and will be followed expectantly for now. The acute renal failure is likely ATN related to shock, and the healthcare team will check urine lytes, etc. Other issues are noted in the ICU team's note today.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition plan involves replacing NG (removed due to not working and unclear position on CXR). Glycemic control will be managed with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a 20 gauge line on 11/24/2190 at 06:48 AM, an 18 gauge line on 11/25/2190 at 05:49 PM, an arterial line on 11/25/2190 at 06:37 PM, and a multi-lumen line on 11/25/2190 at 06:38 PM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with respiratory failure, shock (likely septic), acute renal failure, GI bleed (now quiescent), and a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia, and hypotension. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: Given the presence of fever and hypotension, there is a potential risk of developing septic shock due to a suspected infection, possibly from the pneumonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient already has acute renal failure, which increases the risk of further deterioration in kidney function and potential AKI.
3. Respiratory Complications: Being on invasive ventilation, the patient is at risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and barotrauma.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the GI bleed is currently quiescent, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or complications such as peptic ulcers or varices.
5. Poor Glycemic Control: With a history of diabetes mellitus type II, the patient may be prone to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of
   coffee ground emesis and URI with progressive declining respiratory
   status and hypotension.
   #Sepsis: Fevers and hypotension requiring pressors.  Most likely source
   of fevers and hypotension is underlying pneumonia, given symptoms,
   chest x-ray and  1+ GPC in pairs on sputum GS.  Negative for flu or
   legionella.  Urine and blood cultures are negative.  On Ceftiraxone and
   azithromycin day 5.
   - Vancomycin day 2 for coverage of GPCs.  Would continue ceftriaxone
   for coverage of gram negative organisms and can D/c azithro as five day
   course is complete.  If continues to be febrile over next 24 hrs, would
   consider expanding coverage from ceftriaxone to cefepime to cover
   pseudomonas.  Reculture if spikes.
   -Has been hypertensive and not requiring pressors currently
   - MAP goal > 65
   .
   # Respiratory failure: concern for CAP vs fluid overload vs aspiration
   pneumonitis.  Cardiac etiology less likely an enzymes are negative,
   echo reveals adequate EF.
   -continue tx of PNA as above
   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  Was tachycardic w/ HRs in 160s.  EKG
   obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely
   precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg IV dilt and
   converted to sinus rhythm.
   -Continue on PO dilt 30 mg qid
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   -F/u TSH, metanephrines
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - IV PPI
   - guiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4,  and creatinine
   somewhat responsive to fluid, w/ FeUrea of 10% suggestive of prerenal.
   -Would attempt further fluid challenges today: start w/ 1 L NS bolus
   over 1 hr, assess UOP response.
   -Trend creatinines [**Hospital1 **]
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   .
   # HTN: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg
   daily will restart when able to take PO
   - home blood pressure meds held for hypotension
   -Continue diltiazem qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a URI. He has been experiencing progressive respiratory decline, hypotension, and fevers. The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. The underlying pneumonia could be the source of infection, given the symptoms, chest x-ray, and presence of GPC in sputum. Blood and urine cultures are negative, and the patient is already on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Vancomycin has been started for coverage of GPCs. If the patient continues to be febrile, expanding coverage from ceftriaxone to cefepime to cover pseudomonas may be considered.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning for CAP, fluid overload, or aspiration pneumonitis. Cardiac etiology is less likely as cardiac enzymes are negative, and an echo reveals an adequate ejection fraction. Continuing treatment for pneumonia as above, weaning off ventilation as tolerated, and attempting a switch to pressure support would be appropriate.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was likely caused by"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of
   coffee ground emesis and URI with progressive declining respiratory
   status and hypotension.
   #Sepsis: Fevers and hypotension requiring pressors.  Most likely source
   of fevers and hypotension is underlying pneumonia, given symptoms,
   chest x-ray and  1+ GPC in pairs on sputum GS.  Negative for flu or
   legionella.  Urine and blood cultures are negative.  On Ceftiraxone and
   azithromycin day 5.
   - Vancomycin day 2 for coverage of GPCs.  Would continue ceftriaxone
   for coverage of gram negative organisms and can D/c azithro as five day
   course is complete.  If continues to be febrile over next 24 hrs, would
   consider expanding coverage from ceftriaxone to cefepime to cover
   pseudomonas.  Reculture if spikes.
   -Has been hypertensive and not requiring pressors currently
   - MAP goal > 65
   .
   # Respiratory failure: concern for CAP vs fluid overload vs aspiration
   pneumonitis.  Cardiac etiology less likely an enzymes are negative,
   echo reveals adequate EF.
   -continue tx of PNA as above
   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  Was tachycardic w/ HRs in 160s.  EKG
   obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely
   precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg IV dilt and
   converted to sinus rhythm.
   -Continue on PO dilt 30 mg qid
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   -F/u TSH, metanephrines
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - IV PPI
   - guiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4,  and creatinine
   somewhat responsive to fluid, w/ FeUrea of 10% suggestive of prerenal.
   -Would attempt further fluid challenges today: start w/ 1 L NS bolus
   over 1 hr, assess UOP response.
   -Trend creatinines [**Hospital1 **]
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   .
   # HTN: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg
   daily will restart when able to take PO
   - home blood pressure meds held for hypotension
   -Continue diltiazem qid
   .
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS
   - Metformin held.
   .
   # FEN: IV fluid prn,
   - start TF
   - monitor lytes
   - slowly advance diet

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male presenting with hypoxia in the setting of coffee ground emesis and URI, with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The assessment indicates that the patient may have sepsis, most likely due to underlying pneumonia. The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and vancomycin has been added for coverage of gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The plan is to continue ceftriaxone for coverage of gram-negative organisms and discontinue azithromycin after a five-day course. If the patient remains febrile, consideration will be given to expanding coverage from ceftriaxone to cefepime to cover pseudomonas.

The patient also has respiratory failure, with concerns about community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), fluid overload, or aspiration pneumonitis. The treatment plan includes continuing pneumonia treatment as above, weaning ventilator support as tolerated, and attempting a switch to pressure support.

Additionally, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He received 20 mg IV diltiazem and converted to sinus rhythm. The plan is to continue on PO diltiazem 30 mg qid and monitor for potential thrombotic complications due to the high CHADS2 score. Heparin may be required in the future if atrial fibrillation persists.

The patient has a history of coffee ground emesis, which could be due to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, with a rapid ventricular response rate of 170 beats per minute. AFib can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiac complications.

2. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever despite being on antibiotics. This could indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is intermittently low, requiring pressors for support. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and lead to shock.

4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels. ARF can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infections.

5. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as infection, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.

6. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure with episodes of hypertension alternating with hypotension. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage the heart, blood vessels, and organs.

7. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection in the lungs,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   #Sepsis: Most likely source of fevers is underlying pneumonia, given
   symptoms, chest x-ray and  1+ GPC in pairs on sputum GS.  Negative for
   flu or legionella.  Urine and blood cultures are negative.  On
   Ceftiraxone day 6, Vancomycin day 3 for coverage of GPCs, completed 5
   day course azithro.
   - D/c azithro
   - Add cefepime for ceftriaxone
   - Has been hypertensive and not requiring pressors currently
   - MAP goal > 65
   # Respiratory failure: concern for PNA vs fluid overload vs aspiration
   pneumonitis.  Cardiac etiology less likely an enzymes are negative,
   echo reveals adequate EF.
   -continue tx of PNA as above
   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  Was tachycardic w/ HRs in 160s.  EKG
   obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely
   precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg IV dilt and
   converted to sinus rhythm.
   -Continue on PO dilt 30 mg qid
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   - F/u TSH, metanephrines
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - IV PPI
   - guiac stools, no BM since admission
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4,  and creatinine
   somewhat responsive to fluid, w/ FeUrea of 10% suggestive of prerenal.
   -Would attempt further fluid challenges today: start w/ 1 L NS bolus
   over 1 hr, assess UOP response.
   -Trend creatinines [**Hospital1 **]
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # HTN: Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily,
   HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when able to take PO
   - home blood pressure meds held for hypotension
   -Continue diltiazem qid
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS
   - Metformin held.
   # FEN: IV fluid prn,
   - start TF
   - monitor lytes
   - slowly advance diet

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia, for which he is being treated with antibiotics. The patient also has respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and fluid overload. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's underlying pneumonia could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: If the patient does not convert back to sinus rhythm, there is a high risk of developing thrombotic complications, such as stroke.
4. Coffee ground emesis: The cause of the coffee ground emesis could be gastrointestinal bleeding or hemoptysis from the pneumonia. If the cause is gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient may develop hypotension and require blood transfusions.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function may deteriorate, leading to further accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  Was tachycardic w/ HRs in 160s.  EKG
   obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely
   precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg IV dilt and
   converted to sinus rhythm.
   -Change PO dilt 30 mg to TID
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   - F/u TSH, metanephrines
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.  Hct trending down.
   - repeat NG lavage
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - IV PPI
   - guiac stools, no BM since admission
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4 and creatinine
   somewhat responsive to fluid, w/ FeUrea of 10% suggestive of prerenal.
   -Would attempt further fluid challenges today: start w/ 1 L NS bolus
   over 1 hr, assess UOP response.
   -Trend creatinines [**Hospital1 **]
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # HTN: Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily,
   HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when able to take PO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). He has been experiencing progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and fluid electrolyte imbalance. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers are most likely due to underlying pneumonia, as indicated by symptoms, chest X-ray, and presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum. Negative urine and blood cultures suggest that the source of infection is likely the respiratory tract.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of pneumonia (PNA), fluid overload, or aspiration pneumonitis. The treatment involves continuing antibiotics for PNA, weaning off ventilator support, and attempting to switch to pressure support.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient converted to sinus rhythm after receiving IV diltiazem. However, he is at high risk for developing thrombotic complications due to his CHADS2 score of 5. Anticoagulation may be required if atrial fibrillation persists.
4. Coffee Ground Emesis: The cause is still unclear, with negative upper endoscopy results. Hemoptysis from PNA or gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) are possible causes. Further evaluation is needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, indicating severe respiratory distress. The presence of pneumonia with a new right lower lobe infiltrate suggests an underlying respiratory infection contributing to the respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed a right lower lobe patchy infiltrate on chest X-ray, which indicates pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia should be considered due to the presence of fever and lung infiltrates.

3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient intermittently requires pressors, indicating unstable blood pressure. This may be due to sepsis secondary to the pneumonia or another underlying cause.

4. Fever: Despite antibiotic coverage, the patient's fever persists, suggesting an ongoing infection. Broadening the antibiotic regimen to cover pseudomonas and anaerobes is appropriate given the clinical scenario.

5. Acute renal failure: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. This could be related to sepsis-induced kidney injury or other underlying causes.

6. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure with episodes of hypertension alternating with hypotension. This may be related to stress or an underlying endocrine disorder.

7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has a history of diabetes, which may contribute to the overall complexity of their condition.

8. Hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed"

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and pneumonia.
- The patient's fever continues despite antibiotic therapy, so the antibiotics have been broadened to cover Pseudomonas and anaerobes.
- The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension requiring pressors, but has been off pressors since yesterday.
- There is a concern for acute renal failure due to creatinine levels below the previous baseline.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, both of which require ongoing management.
- A new right lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate suggests a possible pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration.
- There was an episode of hematemesis, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been initiated. Serial hematocrit checks will be done, and if there is a significant drop, a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The presence of central lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The new right lower lobe infiltrate raises the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, especially considering the patient's critical condition and potential difficulty in protecting their airway.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The decreasing urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential AK"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   #Sepsis: Most likely source of fevers is underlying pneumonia, given
   symptoms, chest x-ray and  1+ GPC in pairs on sputum GS.  Negative for
   flu or legionella.  Urine and blood cultures are negative.  On
   Ceftiraxone day 7, Vancomycin day 2 for coverage of GPCs, Zosyn/levo
   day 2 after 6d ceftriaxone, completed 5 day course azithro.  With
   elevated BP and not requiring pressors currently
   - maintain MAP goal > 65
   # Respiratory failure: likely bacterial PNA on top of ? viral vs
   aspiration pneumonitis.  Cardiac etiology and fluid overload  less
   likely an enzymes are negative, echo reveals adequate EF.  Only
   tolerated limited PSV yesterday.
   -continue tx of PNA as above
   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  One episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in 160s
   2d ago.  EKG obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of
   afib.  Likely precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg
   IV dilt and converted to sinus rhythm.  Started on dilt 30mg TID
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.  Hct trending down but stable.  Repeat NG
   lavage negative.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - IV PPI
   - guiac stools, no BM since admission
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 and creatinine
   somewhat responsive to fluid, w/ FeUrea of 10% suggestive of prerenal.
    UOP improved.
   - Fluid challenge as needed to maintain UOP >50cc/hr
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # HTN: Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily,
   HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when able to take PO
   - home blood pressure meds held for hypotension
   -Continue diltiazem tid

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who presented hypoxic with coffee ground emesis and upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient has been experiencing declining respiratory status, hypotension, and sepsis. The most likely source of fevers is pneumonia, as indicated by symptoms, chest x-ray, and presence of GPC in sputum. Blood and urine cultures are negative.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Sepsis: The patient is most likely suffering from sepsis due to pneumonia. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be controlled.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely caused by bacterial pneumonia on top of viral infection or aspiration pneumonitis. Cardiac etiology and fluid overload are less likely.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient had one episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s. An EKG revealed atrial fibrillation, which was likely precipitated by fluid overload and hypertension. The patient was given IV diltiazem and converted back to sinus rhythm. He will be started on oral diltiazem.

4. Coffee ground emesis: The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis, which can be due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or hemoptysis from pneumonia. An upper endoscopy was negative, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   #Sepsis: Most likely source of fevers is underlying pneumonia, given
   symptoms, chest x-ray and  1+ GPC in pairs on sputum GS.  Negative for
   flu or legionella.  Urine and blood cultures are negative.  On
   Vancomycin day 2 for coverage of GPCs, Zosyn/levo day 2 after 6d
   ceftriaxone, completed 5 day course azithro.  With elevated BP and not
   requiring pressors currently.
   - stop abx given that no source identified,  WBC normal, BP good
   - maintain MAP goal > 65
   - lipase
   # Respiratory failure: likely bacterial PNA on top of ? viral vs
   aspiration pneumonitis.  Cardiac etiology and fluid overload  less
   likely an enzymes are negative, echo reveals adequate EF.  Only
   tolerated limited PSV yesterday.
   -continue tx of PNA as above
   -wean vent as tolerated (reduce PEEP) and attempt switch to pressure
   support
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR -  One episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in 160s
   2d ago.  EKG obtained revealing atrial fibrillation.  No prior hx of
   afib.  Likely precipitants include fluid overload and HTN.  Got 20 mg
   IV dilt and converted to sinus rhythm.  Started on dilt 30mg TID
   -Has CHADS2 score of 5, so at high risk for developing thrombotic
   complications if atrial fibrillation persists.  Does have hx of coffee
   ground emesis and slow decrease in HCT over last several days.  Would
   hold heparin for now in the setting of possible bleed, but may require
   anticoagulation in future if atrial fibrillation persists.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy negative.  Hct trending down.
   GIB vs hemoptysis from PNA.  Hct trending down but stable.  Repeat NG
   lavage negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, coffee ground emesis, and urinary tract infection (URI). He presented with declining respiratory status, hypotension, and fever. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin, but no source of infection has been identified. His current medications include Diltiazem, Metformin, and HCTZ.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, chest x-ray, and presence of GPC in sputum suggest underlying pneumonia as the most likely source of fevers. Blood and sputum cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from bacterial pneumonia on top of viral or aspiration pneumonitis. Cardiac etiology and fluid overload are less likely.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient had an episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s, and subsequent EKG revealed atrial fibrillation. Possible precipitants include fluid overload and hypertension.
4. Coffee Ground Emesis: The patient's upper endoscopy was negative, but he has a history of coffee ground emesis and a decreasing hematocrit (HCT) level. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or hemoptysis from pneumonia could be possible causes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a urinary tract infection (URI). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with persistent fevers, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Given the symptoms, chest x-ray findings, and presence of GPC in sputum GS, pneumonia seems to be the most likely source of the fevers. Negative urine and blood cultures suggest that the source of infection has not yet been identified. The patient is already on vancomycin and Zosyn, but these medications may need to be adjusted or additional antibiotics may be required.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is likely bacterial pneumonia on top of viral infection or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's cardiac function appears to be adequate, as indicated by normal enzyme levels and an echocardiogram revealing an adequate ejection fraction. Weaning off the ventilator should be done gradually, reducing PEEP and attempting switch to pressure support.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s and was found to have atr"

   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status
   # Persistent fevers: The patient no longer has sepsis physiology, but
   continues to be febrile when he is not receiving Tylenol.  Cooling
   blanket in place, yesterday we stopped abx as there was no source
   identified and his initial leukocytosis had resolved.  He does have a
   worsening retrocardiac opacity.  Lipase normal, suggesting this is not
   pancreatitis (pt has history of pancreatic ca).  CXR unchanged this
   morning and all cultures negative to date.  Other possibilities include
   drug fever, malignancy or rheumatologic source.
   - Repeat cultures now that patient is off of antibiotics.
   - Cannot check HIV status at the moment as the patient does not have a
   designated health care proxy.
   - Had a positive RF in [**Name (NI) 319**], unclear why tested.  Touch base with
   PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8947**].
   - Trend fever curve.
   # Respiratory failure: Yesterday did poorly with spontaneous breathing
   trial, but now tolerating CPAP well.  Likely viral PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis.  Fluid overload also likely contributing though echo
   reveals hyperdynamic EF.  We will continue to diurese aggressively.
   - Responding well to diuresis without rise in Cr. Continue today with
   Lasix boluses of 40mg IV x2, goal negative 1.5 to 2L.
   - Continue pressure support, plan for spontaneous breathing trial
   tomorrow..
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in
   160s 2d due to Afib w/ RVR.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem.
   Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, holding
   off for now given recent GI bleed.
   # HTN: Hypertensive overnight and started on Hydralazine 10mg Q6hrs.
   Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ
   25mg daily will restart when able to take PO.
   - started on hydralazine overnight which we will stop today as he has
   slightly low BPs.
   - home blood pressure meds initially held for hypotension.  Holding
   Cozaar because of renal impairment and HCTZ while he is being
   diuresed.  Yesterday we restarted Alpha-Methyldopa.  If he is
   hypertensive again we will titrate up his diltiazem.
   # Constipation: He has not had a bowel movement since his arrival,
   though he has been getting lactulose and dulcolax.  Today we will try a
   suppository and if that does not work, give a soap suds enema.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative.
   Hematocrit now stable.  Will hold off on further work-up at this time.
   - Continue IV PPI, can transfer to PO when able.
   - guiac stools when able - BM since admission
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS.  Yesterday sugars were stably elevated to 200s.
   - Give half of insulin as QHS lantus.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: IV fluid prn,
   - on  TF
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - IV PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient has a history of hypertension, benign fever, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and pancreatic cancer.

2. The patient presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, URI with declining respiratory status, and hypotension.

3. The patient is currently experiencing persistent fevers despite being off antibiotics, altered mental status, and worsening retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.

4. The patient's initial leukocytosis has resolved, and cultures are negative to date. Other possible causes of fever include drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic source.

5. The patient had a positive RF test, but the reason for testing is unclear. It is mentioned to touch base with the patient's primary care physician.

6. The patient is tolerating CPAP well but had a poor response to a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday. It is likely viral PNA versus aspiration pneumonitis. Fluid overload is also contributing to respiratory failure, and the patient has a hyperdynamic EF on echo. Aggressive diuresis is planned to continue today, aiming for negative 1.5 to 2L fluid balance.

7. The patient had one episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. No prior history of afib was noted"

   # Respiratory failure: Yesterday did poorly with spontaneous breathing
   trial, but now tolerating CPAP well.  Likely viral PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis.  Fluid overload also likely contributing though echo
   reveals hyperdynamic EF.
   - Responding well to diuresis without rise in Cr. Continue today with
   Lasix boluses of 40mg IV x2.
   - Continue pressure support and wean as tolerated.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in
   160s 2d due to Afib w/ RVR.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem.
   Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, holding
   off for now given recent GI bleed.
   # HTN: Hypertensive overnight and started on Hydralazine 10mg Q6hrs.

   -Continue hydral and diltiazem tid
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative.
   Hematocrit now stable.  Will hold off on further work-up at this time.
   - Continue IV PPI, can transfer to PO when able.
   - guiac stools when able - BM since admission

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of benign hypertension, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. He presented hypoxic with coffee ground emesis and URI, showing progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient now has persistent fevers and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been febrile, even after discontinuing antibiotics. Further evaluation is needed to identify the cause, which could include drug fever, malignancy, or a rheumatologic source.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials but is now tolerating CPAP well. The likely cause of respiratory failure is viral pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient is responding to diuretics without an increase in creatinine levels. Pressure support should be continued, and weaning should be done as tolerated.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s due to new-onset AFib w/ RVR. This may have been precipitated by fluid overload and hypertension. The patient's heart rate is now controlled with diltiazem, but he may require anticoagulation due to a high CHADS score. Anticoagulation should be considered once the patient's GI bleed risk has resolved.
4. Hypertension: The patient was"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status
   # Persistent fevers: The patient no longer has sepsis physiology, but
   continues to be febrile when he is not receiving Tylenol.  Cooling
   blanket in place, yesterday we stopped abx as there was no source
   identified and his initial leukocytosis had resolved.  He does have a
   worsening retrocardiac opacity.  Lipase normal, suggesting this is not
   pancreatitis (pt has history of pancreatic ca), RUQ negative.  CXR
   unchanged this morning and all cultures negative to date.  Other
   possibilities include drug fever, malignancy or rheumatologic source.
   - Repeat cultures off abx pending
   - Stop all unnecessary medications
   - Had a positive RF in [**Name (NI) 319**], unclear why tested.  Touch base with
   PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8947**].
   - Trend fever curve.
   # Respiratory failure: Tired on PSV yesterday, seems to tire easily.
   Likely viral PNA vs aspiration pneumonitis vs muscle weakness.  Fluid
   overload also contributing though echo reveals hyperdynamic EF.  We
   will continue to diurese.
   - NIF today to evaluate weakness
   - Responding well to diuresis without rise in Cr. Continue today with
   Lasix boluses of 40mg IV x2, was net negative 1L, goal negative 1.5 to
   2L.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in
   160s 2d due to Afib w/ RVR.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem.
   Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, holding
   off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID
   # HTN: Hypertensive stopped yesterday.  Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa
   500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when
   able to take PO.
   -  on Methyldopa and Diltiazam
   - home blood pressure meds initially held for hypotension.  Holding
   Cozaar because of renal impairment and HCTZ while he is being
   diuresed.  If he is hypertensive again we will titrate up his
   diltiazem.
   # Constipation: He has not had a bowel movement since his arrival,
   though he has been getting lactulose and dulcolax.  Today we will try a
   suppository and if that does not work, give a soap suds enema. Large BM
   starting at 9pm.  Trace guaiac positive.
   - C.diff sent
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative.
   Hematocrit now stable.  Will hold off on further work-up at this time.
   - Continue IV PPI, can transfer to PO when able.
   - stools trace guaiac positive
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS.  Yesterday sugars were elevated to 200s.
   - Adjust SSI
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: IV fluid prn,
   - on  TF
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - IV PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI symptoms. He has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, constipation, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and fluid overload.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tired on pressure support ventilation and seems to tire easily. This suggests that he may have viral pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Fluid overload is also contributing to his respiratory failure, although an echocardiogram reveals a hyperdynamic ejection fraction. Diuretics are being continued to manage fluid overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient experienced one episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s due to AFib w/ RVR. This may be caused by fluid overload and hypertension. The patient's heart rate is now controlled with diltiazem. Anticoagulation is being considered given the high CHADS score, but it is being held off for now due to a recent gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled with alpha-methyldopa, Cozaar, and HCTZ. However, these medications were temporarily stopped due to hypotension."

   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status
   # Persistent fevers: The patient no longer has sepsis physiology, but
   continues to be febrile when he is not receiving Tylenol.  Cooling
   blanket in place, yesterday we stopped abx as there was no source
   identified and his initial leukocytosis had resolved.  He does have a
   worsening retrocardiac opacity.  Lipase normal, suggesting this is not
   pancreatitis (pt has history of pancreatic ca), RUQ negative.  CXR
   unchanged this morning and all cultures negative to date.  Other
   possibilities include drug fever, malignancy or rheumatologic source.
   - Repeat cultures off abx pending
   - Cannot check HIV status at the moment as the patient does not have a
   designated health care proxy.
   - Had a positive RF in [**Name (NI) 319**], unclear why tested.  Touch base with
   PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8947**].
   - Trend fever curve.
   # Respiratory failure: Tired on PSV yesterdayl.  Likely viral PNA vs
   aspiration pneumonitis.  Fluid overload also likely contributing though
   echo reveals hyperdynamic EF.  We will continue to diurese
   aggressively.
   - SBT today
   - Responding well to diuresis without rise in Cr. Continue today with
   Lasix boluses of 40mg IV x2, was net negative 1L, goal negative 1.5 to
   2L.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in
   160s 2d due to Afib w/ RVR.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem.
   Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, holding
   off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID
   # HTN: Hypertensive stopped yesterday.  Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa
   500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when
   able to take PO.
   -  on Methyldopa and Diltiazam
   - home blood pressure meds initially held for hypotension.  Holding
   Cozaar because of renal impairment and HCTZ while he is being
   diuresed.  If he is hypertensive again we will titrate up his
   diltiazem.
   # Constipation: He has not had a bowel movement since his arrival,
   though he has been getting lactulose and dulcolax.  Today we will try a
   suppository and if that does not work, give a soap suds enema. Large BM
   starting at 9pm.  Trace guaiac positive.
   - C.diff sent
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative.
   Hematocrit now stable.  Will hold off on further work-up at this time.
   - Continue IV PPI, can transfer to PO when able.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection. He has been experiencing declining respiratory status, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and pancreatic cancer. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to viral pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Aggressive diuresis has been initiated to manage fluid overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient had an episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s and was diagnosed with AFib w/ RVR. Rate control has been achieved with diltiazem, and the patient may require anticoagulation due to a high CHADS score.
3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension requiring the cessation of antihypertensive medications. Blood pressure will be monitored closely, and medications will be restarted once the patient is stable.
4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission. Lactulose and Dulcolax have been given, and a suppository will be tried today. If unsuccessful, a soap suds enema will be administered.

He has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypertension, constipation, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Persistent fevers: The patient continues to have fevers despite no identified source and negative cultures. Possible causes include drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic source.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is tired on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and likely has viral pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Fluid overload may also be contributing to respiratory failure.

3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient had one episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s due to atrial fibrillation with RVR. Possible precipitants include fluid overload and hypertension. The patient is now rate-controlled with diltiazem.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and his home medications for hypertension have been temporarily held due to hypotension. If he becomes hypertensive again, his diltiazem dose may be titrated up.

5. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission, and a large bowel movement started at 9 pm. There is"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status
   # Persistent fevers: The patient no longer has sepsis physiology, but
   continues to be febrile when he is not receiving Tylenol.  Cooling
   blanket in place, yesterday we stopped abx as there was no source
   identified and his initial leukocytosis had resolved.  He does have a
   worsening retrocardiac opacity.  Lipase normal, suggesting this is not
   pancreatitis (pt has history of pancreatic ca), RUQ negative.  CXR
   unchanged this morning and all cultures negative to date.  Other
   possibilities include drug fever, malignancy or rheumatologic source.
   - Repeat cultures off abx pending
   - Cannot check HIV status at the moment as the patient does not have a
   designated health care proxy.
   - Had a positive RF in [**Name (NI) 319**], unclear why tested.  Touch base with
   PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8947**].
   - Trend fever curve.
   # Respiratory failure: Tired on PSV yesterdayl.  Likely viral PNA vs
   aspiration pneumonitis.  Fluid overload also likely contributing though
   echo reveals hyperdynamic EF.  We will continue to diurese
   aggressively.
   - SBT today
   - Responding well to diuresis without rise in Cr. Continue today with
   Lasix boluses of 40mg IV x2, was net negative 1L, goal negative 1.5 to
   2L.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of tachycardia w/ HRs in
   160s 2d due to Afib w/ RVR.  No prior hx of afib.  Likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem.
   Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, holding
   off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID
   # HTN: Hypertensive stopped yesterday.  Home meds: Alpha-Methyldopa
   500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **], Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily will restart when
   able to take PO.
   -  on Methyldopa and Diltiazam
   - home blood pressure meds initially held for hypotension.  Holding
   Cozaar because of renal impairment and HCTZ while he is being
   diuresed.  If he is hypertensive again we will titrate up his
   diltiazem.
   # Constipation: He has not had a bowel movement since his arrival,
   though he has been getting lactulose and dulcolax.  Today we will try a
   suppository and if that does not work, give a soap suds enema. Large BM
   starting at 9pm.  Trace guaiac positive.
   - C.diff sent
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative.
   Hematocrit now stable.  Will hold off on further work-up at this time.
   - Continue IV PPI, can transfer to PO when able.
   - stools trace guaiac positive
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS.  Yesterday sugars were stably elevated to 200s.
   - Give half of insulin as QHS lantus.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: IV fluid prn,
   - on  TF
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - IV PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 76-year-old male, was admitted with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. He presented with declining respiratory status, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and has had episodes of tachycardia. He has a history of pancreatic cancer and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), hypertension, constipation, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and an inability to tolerate oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and previous leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to assess the effectiveness of respiratory support.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia with heart rates in the 160s due to AFib w/ RVR. Rate control measures have been implemented, but the patient may require anticoagulation given his high"

   # Respiratory failure: Tired on PSV yesterday, seems to tire easily.
   NIF -15 suggesting generalized weakness in setting of infection.  CT
   cocnerning for atelectasis and chronic aspiaration, however PNA
   unlikely.
   - treat underlying infection
   - wean vent as tolerated
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, upper respiratory infection (URI), progressive respiratory decline, and hypotension. The patient has persistent fevers, altered mental status, and has undergone several diagnostic tests and treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Early abscess formation due to the small rim-enhancing fluid collection in the left tonsillar pillar.
2. Aspiration or atelectasis based on the nonspecific appearance of left basilar consolidations in the CT chest.
3. Drug fever due to unnecessary medications.
4. Chronic aspiration leading to respiratory failure.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
6. Hypertension.
7. Coffee ground emesis indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency.
9. Diabetes mellitus type II.
10. Pressure ulcers (due to prolonged bedridden status).

Please note that this is a summary and the patient's condition may have evolved since the last update. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and plan of care."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The note details the patient's symptoms, test results, treatment plans, and ongoing assessments. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) and persistent fevers. The CT chest report shows nonspecific appearance of left basilar consolidations, suggesting aspiration or atelectasis. There is also a concern for possible pneumonia, which is being treated with Augmentin.
2. Early abscess formation: The CT neck report indicates a small, 9-mm rim-enhancing fluid collection on the left tonsillar pillar with liquefactive necrosis. This suggests early abscess formation, which may require further intervention.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels range from 1.2-1.4. There is ongoing monitoring of the creatinine trend and efforts to avoid hypoperfusion and nephrotoxic agents.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has a history of diabetes, as indicated by the use of metformin and insulin (ISS). Blood sugar levels are being monitored closely.
5. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be related to sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), or other underlying conditions.
6. Atrial fibrillation"

   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: CT concerning for PTA and sinusitis.  ENT
   evaluated, small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.
   Augmentin and nasal sprays.  Blood culture [**2-5**] postitive for GPC in
   pairs and clusters.  Concern for bacteremia given fevers however also
   could be contamination.  Low grade fevers off Tylenol, but restarted
   given pain.  CT chest without evidence of PNA.  The patient no longer
   has sepsis physiology.   Other possibilities include drug fever, all
   unnecessary meds stopped.
   - repeat cultures x2
   - pull line, replace with PICC
   - f/u ENT recs
   - Repeat cultures off abx pending
   - Continue augmentin for 10d
    # Respiratory failure: Tired on PSV yesterday, seems to tire easily.
   NIF -15 suggesting generalized weakness in setting of infection.  CT
   cocnerning for atelectasis and chronic aspiaration, however PNA
   unlikely.
   - treat underlying infection
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Weakness: Respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF.  Also seems to
   have general peripheral weakness, greater than would be expected.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization.  Concern for neurologic source for
   weakness.
   - Attempt to get further history as to function prior to
   hospitalization
   - Consider neuromuscular consult
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - Re start PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU with persistent fevers, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, hypotension, and positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters suggest a possible bacterial infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining, and he is on mechanical ventilation. There is concern for pneumonia, but other possibilities include drug fever or atelectasis.
3. Neurologic Source for Weakness: The patient's general peripheral weakness and respiratory weakness may be due to a neurologic source, considering his history of dysphagia prior to hospitalization.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient's coffee ground emesis and positive guaiac test indicate possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation with a colonoscopy is planned.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Fluid rehydration has been initiated, and daily creatinine trends are being monitored.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He now has persistent fevers, altered mental status, and a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's condition is concerning for possible pneumonia, sinusitis, and bacteremia. Other possibilities include drug fever or contamination. 

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and he is experiencing generalized weakness. Imaging shows concern for atelectasis and chronic aspiration, but pneumonia is unlikely. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. He also has diabetes mellitus type II and requires further evaluation for potential neurologic causes of weakness. 

The patient's coffee ground emesis is being investigated further with a negative upper endoscopy and NG lavage, but trace guaiac positive. Hematocrit is stable, and a colonoscopy is planned when the patient is stable. 

The patient's diabetes medication has been adjusted, and his blood sugar levels are now in the low 200s. 

The patient's current medications include Augmentin, nasal sprays, Tylenol, diltiazem, methyldopa, heparin, and others. 

The patient's lines include an arterial line, multi-lumen line"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Likely line infection with 2/2 blood cultures for
   GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day 3,
   surviellence cultures pending.  Central  line removed.  Also CT
   concerning for sinusitis being treated with Augmentin and nasal
   sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA, small abscess, attempted drainage, none
   aspirated.  Low grade fevers on Tylenol.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - daily surviellence cultures
   - line holiday, will need PICC
   - continue vanc and augmentin
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Weakness improved somewhat when sedation weaned off.
   Also respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF, today -17.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization.
   - Wean sedation and further eval weakness
   - If no improvement over weekend, neuro to evaluate for neuromuscular
   source
   # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV all day and tolerated well.  Seems to
   be related to weakness as the CT is cocnerning for atelectasis and
   chronic aspiaration, however PNA unlikely.
   - wean vent as tolerated, SBT
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium elevated to 148
   - increase free water to 150cc q4
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue diazepam TID
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
   # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   # DMII: ISS and QID FS.  ISS adjusted yesterday, now BS in low 200s.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN:
   - on  TF
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure, initially thought to be due to an upper respiratory infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He now has persistent fevers, altered mental status, and generalized weakness. The patient has a history of dysphagia prior to hospitalization. He has been treated with vancomycin for a suspected line infection and augmentin for sinusitis. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated sodium levels (148 mEq/L), low potassium levels (3.4 mEq/L), and an elevated creatinine level (1.3 mg/dL). His white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 9.5 and 11.0 K/uL. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible Staphylococcus aureus infection. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, hypernatremia, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube, and has an arterial line for monitoring. He is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to the underlying"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient's respiratory status has been declining progressively along with hypotension. He now has persistent fevers and altered mental status.

Medical Complications:
1. Persistent fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which are likely due to a line infection as indicated by blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The central line has been removed, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin. Surveillance cultures are pending.
2. Weakness: The patient has generalized weakness, which is likely due to myopathy. There is improvement in weakness when sedation is weaned off. The patient also has respiratory weakness as demonstrated by negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -17. The patient had a history of dysphagia prior to hospitalization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to respiratory failure. This seems to be related to weakness and chronic aspiration, but pneumonia is unlikely.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated to 148. Free water should be increased to 150cc q4.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be related to fluid overload and hypertension. Rate control has been"

   Imaging: [**2190-12-1**] CT chest
   1. Left greater than right bibasilar consolidations, the appearance is
   nonspecific, and can be attributed to atelectasis, aspiration or
   infection,
   however, in review of the time course of multiple prior radiographs,
   the
   findings are in favor of improving atelectasis or aspiration and less
   likely
   infectious pneumonia.
   2. Ground glass opacities in the right upper lobe, the time course
   cannot be
   reliably established rendering these concerning for aspiration or
   pneumonia.
   3. Probably reactive borderline lymph nodes.
   4. Large hiatal hernia.
   CT neck [**2190-12-1**]
   1. The presence of endotracheal and endogastric tubes limits the
   evaluation
   of the retropharyngeal and prevertebral soft tissue spaces; however,
   there is
   no definite effusion, phlegmon or collection at these sites.
   1. Small, 9-mm apparent rim-enhancing fluid collection located roughly
   at the
   level of the left tonsillar pillar, which may represent liquefactive
   necrosis
   and early abscess formation; this should be correlated with findings on
   direct
   physical examination.
   2. Extensive fluid opacification of all visualized paranasal sinuses,
   left
   more than right mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities and the nasal
   cavity
   and nasopharynx, likely related to protracted intubation and supine
   positioning. While concurrent infection cannot be excluded by imaging,
   there
   is no evidence of bone destruction.
   3. Scattered patchy ground glass opacities in a peribronchovascular
   distribution in the lung apices; please see separately-dictated report
   of
   concurrent chest CT for further details.
   4. Grossly patent cervical tracheal airway, with endotracheal tube in
   situ.

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented hypoxic with coffee ground emesis and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. He had progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient now has persistent fevers, altered mental status, and generalized weakness. The CT chest showed bibasilar consolidations, which are likely due to atelectasis or aspiration rather than infectious pneumonia. The CT neck revealed a small abscess in the left tonsillar pillar area, extensive fluid opacification of the paranasal sinuses, and patchy ground glass opacities in the lung apices. The patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a likely line infection. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and augmentin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and respiratory distress, along with the CT findings of bibasilar consolidations, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status closely.
2. Abscess: The presence of a small abscess in the left tonsillar pillar area on the CT neck indicates a localized infection. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or spread of the abscess is necessary.
3. Sinusitis: The extensive fluid opacification of the paranasal sinuses seen on the CT neck suggests sinusitis. The patient is already being treated with augment"

   Imaging: [**2190-12-1**] CT chest
   1. Left greater than right bibasilar consolidations, the appearance is
   nonspecific, and can be attributed to atelectasis, aspiration or
   infection,
   however, in review of the time course of multiple prior radiographs,
   the
   findings are in favor of improving atelectasis or aspiration and less
   likely
   infectious pneumonia.
   2. Ground glass opacities in the right upper lobe, the time course
   cannot be
   reliably established rendering these concerning for aspiration or
   pneumonia.
   3. Probably reactive borderline lymph nodes.
   4. Large hiatal hernia.
   CT neck [**2190-12-1**]
   1. The presence of endotracheal and endogastric tubes limits the
   evaluation
   of the retropharyngeal and prevertebral soft tissue spaces; however,
   there is
   no definite effusion, phlegmon or collection at these sites.
   1. Small, 9-mm apparent rim-enhancing fluid collection located roughly
   at the
   level of the left tonsillar pillar, which may represent liquefactive
   necrosis
   and early abscess formation; this should be correlated with findings on
   direct
   physical examination.
   2. Extensive fluid opacification of all visualized paranasal sinuses,
   left
   more than right mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities and the nasal
   cavity
   and nasopharynx, likely related to protracted intubation and supine
   positioning. While concurrent infection cannot be excluded by imaging,
   there
   is no evidence of bone destruction.
   3. Scattered patchy ground glass opacities in a peribronchovascular
   distribution in the lung apices; please see separately-dictated report
   of
   concurrent chest CT for further details.
   4. Grossly patent cervical tracheal airway, with endotracheal tube in
   situ.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Likely line infection with 2/2 blood cultures for
   GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day 4 (started
   [**2190-12-2**]), surviellence cultures pending.  Central  line removed.  Also
   CT concerning for sinusitis being treated with Augmentin and nasal
   sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA, small abscess, attempted drainage, none
   aspirated.  Low grade fevers on Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**]
   100.5.  CT chest without evidence of PNA.
   - daily surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to
   date
   - line holiday, will need PICC
   - continue vanc
   - restart augmentin, continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Weakness improved somewhat when sedation weaned off.
   Also respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF, today -18.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization.
   - Continue off sedation
   - If no improvement over weekend, neuro to evaluate for neuromuscular
   source --> would retouch base with them Monday to eval for NM disease,
   consider EMG with repetitive stim
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV all day and tolerated well.  Seems
   to be related to weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and
   chronic aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Last ABG 7.44/52/105/36/9
   with normal lactate.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium elevated to 148 --> 149 today. Free H2O deficit
   calculated is 3L.
   - currently getting free water at 150cc q4hrs
   - increase free water to 150cc q2 and recheck Na this pm
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen  --> current one outdates [**2190-12-6**]
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 8L

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a urinary tract infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He has persistent fevers and altered mental status. The patient has been treated with vancomycin for a line infection, Augmentin for sinusitis, and nasal sprays for sinus congestion. His weakness is likely due to myopathy, as evaluated by a neurologist. He also has respiratory failure and chronic aspiration, but no pneumonia. His sodium levels are elevated, and he is receiving free water to correct the imbalance. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being rate-controlled with diltiazem. He has hypertension and is being treated with methyldopa and diltiazam. The patient also has chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and requires insulin adjustments. He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for a line infection, indicating a possible central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure and chronic aspiration, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory"

   - restart augmentin, continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Weakness improved somewhat when sedation weaned off.
   Also respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF, today -23.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process.
   - Continue off sedation
   - Slight improvement over weekend, neuro to evaluate for neuromuscular
   source --> would retouch base with them Monday to eval for NM disease,
   consider EMG with repetitive stim
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating..  Seems to be related
   to weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT, but given NIF
   -23 will need neuromuscular C/s before extubation.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -will attempt extubation most likely tomorrow, if fails then trach will
   be necessary
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium elevated to 147. Improving with free water
   250cc q4.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen  --> current one outdates [**2190-12-6**]
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 8L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs. BS in 200s.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Glargine
   -increase glargine as needed.
   # FEN:
   - on TF Nutren Pulmonary 55cc/hr
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He has persistent fevers, altered mental status, and a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypertension (HTN), chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and dysphagia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Persistent fevers: Possible line infection with blood cultures for gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin. Central line removed, no growth to date from tip. Also, CT concerning for sinusitis being treated with augmentin and nasal sprays.
2. Weakness: Generalized weakness evaluated by neuro who felt likely due to myopathy. Weakness improved somewhat when sedation was weaned off. Also, respiratory weakness as demonstrated by negative inspiratory force (NIF), today -23. H/o dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.
3. Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] pressure support ventilation (PSV), tolerating. Seems to be related to weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic aspiration, however, pneumonia (PNA) unlikely. Did well on last spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but given NIF -"

   growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis being
   treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA, small
   abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**]  100.5; Tmax today 100.1.  CT chest
   without evidence of PNA.
   - daily surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to

   - line holiday, will need PICC
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - restart augmentin, continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Weakness improved somewhat when sedation weaned off.
   Also respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF, today -17.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process.
   - Continue off sedation
   - If no improvement over weekend, neuro to evaluate for neuromuscular

   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a urinary tract infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
- The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, likely due to a line infection. Central line removal showed no growth to date.
- The patient's CT scan showed diffuse opacification of the paranasal sinuses, which may be attributed to intubation and cannot exclude infection.
- The patient's weakness is likely due to myopathy, as evaluated by a neurologist. There has been some improvement when sedation was weaned off.
- The patient's respiratory failure seems to be related to weakness, as well as atelectasis and chronic aspiration, but pneumonia is unlikely.
- The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 147, improving with free water administration.
- The patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is now rate-controlled with diltiazem. Anticoagulation is considered due to a high CHADS score, but is being held off for now.
- The patient's hypertension is stable, and they are on methyldopa and diltiazem. Beta blockers and diuretics have been held.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Possible line infection with 2/2 blood cultures
   for GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**6-10**]
   (started [**2190-12-2**]), surveillence cultures pending.  Central  line
   removed, no growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis
   being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA,
   small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5; Tmax today 100.1.  CT chest
   without evidence of PNA.
   - daily surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to
   date
   - line holiday, will need PICC if continues to require [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold
   for now given that he only needs 2 more days of [**First Name3 (LF) 114**].
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - restart augmentin, continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Weakness improved somewhat when sedation weaned off.
   Also respiratory weakness as demonstrated by NIF, today -23.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process.
   - Continue off sedation
   - Slight improvement over weekend, neuro to evaluate for neuromuscular
   source --> would retouch base with them Monday to eval for NM disease,
   consider EMG with repetitive stim
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating..  Seems to be related
   to weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT, but given NIF
   -23 will need neuromuscular C/s before extubation.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -will attempt extubation most likely tomorrow, if fails then trach will
   be necessary
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium elevated to 147. Improving with free water
   250cc q4.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen  --> current one outdates [**2190-12-6**]
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 8L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs. BS in 200s.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Glargine
   -increase glargine as needed.
   # FEN:
   - on TF Nutren Pulmonary 55cc/hr
   - monitor lytes
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented hypoxic with coffee ground emesis and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. He has been in the ICU for several days with declining respiratory status, hypotension, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications, including potential line infection, sinusitis, generalized weakness, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypertension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and feeding tube nutrition.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin for possible line infection, augmentin for sinusitis, fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for sinusitis, diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation, methyldopa for hypertension, PPI for coffee ground emesis, and glargine for DMII.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 142/110 to 119/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine and liver function tests. His blood cultures have been negative so far,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). He has been in the ICU for several days with declining respiratory status, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical conditions including chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypernatremia. He has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, nasal sprays, and sedation weaning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has had persistent fevers and blood cultures were taken due to suspected line infection. Central line removal did not show any growth to date. Surveillance cultures remain negative.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation and has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He tolerated this well and is now being weaned off sedation. Atelectasis and chronic aspiration are concerns, but pneumonia is unlikely. The plan is to attempt extubation today.
3. Myopathy: The patient's weakness has been evaluated by neurology, and it is likely due to myopathy. There is improvement in muscle strength.
4. Stroke: Head CT shows no acute intracranial process, but an MRI may be considered to evaluate for stroke.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has resolved with free water administration.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Possible line infection with 2/2 blood cultures
   for GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**7-11**]
   (started [**2190-12-2**]), surveillence cultures pending.  Central line
   removed, no growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis
   being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA,
   small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - line holiday, will need PICC if continues to require [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold
   for now given that he only needs 1 more day of [**First Name3 (LF) 114**].
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - Continue augmentin (day [**5-11**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy. Feel [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] very unlikely.   Weakness improved
   somewhat when sedation weaned off.  Also respiratory weakness as
   demonstrated by NIF, yesterday -23.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process. Spoke
   with neuro yesterday, will discuss possibility of NM consult today to
   determine prognosis. Recommended considering MRI possibly to evaluate
   for stroke as CT not as sensitive for this.
   - Continue off sedation
   -Improvement in muscle strength. Will plan to attempt extubation today
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating.  Seems to be related to
   weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT.  Per
   respiratory notes from this morning, patient does have very good cough.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -will attempt extubation today
   -if fails extubation will need trach
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiac positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 8L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs. BS in 200s.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Glargine
   # FEN: currently NPO for planned extubation this morning.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI. He has been experiencing progressive declining respiratory status, hypotension, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and dysphagia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Central line removal did not show any growth, but surveillance cultures remain negative. There is a possibility of a line infection.
2. Sinusitis: The patient has been treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays for sinusitis. A CT scan is concerning for sinusitis.
3. Myopathy: The patient's weakness is evaluated by a neurologist who felt it was likely due to myopathy. The weakness improved when sedation was weaned off.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and tolerating it well. There is concern for atelectasis and chronic aspiration, but pneumonia is unlikely. The patient did well on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and will attempt extubation today.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had resolved hypernatremia and is currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). He has been in the ICU with progressive respiratory decline, hypotension, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated for a possible line infection, sinusitis, and atrial fibrillation with RVR. He is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, augmentin, fluticasone nasal sprays, diltiazem, methyl dopa, and glargine. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated blood glucose levels. The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin, augmentin, and fluticasone nasal sprays. The patient's weakness has improved somewhat when sedation was weaned off, and he will attempt extubation today. If unsuccessful, a tracheostomy may be required. Other concerns include hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus type II."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Possible line infection with 2/2 blood cultures
   for GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**7-11**]
   (started [**2190-12-2**]), surveillence cultures pending.  Central line
   removed, no growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis
   being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA,
   small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - line holiday, will need PICC if continues to require [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold
   for now given that he only needs 1 more day of [**First Name3 (LF) 114**].
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - Continue augmentin (day [**5-11**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy. Feel [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] very unlikely.   Weakness improved
   somewhat when sedation weaned off.  Some respiratory weakness as
   demonstrated by NIF, yesterday -23, today -28, so improving.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process. Spoke with neuro yesterday, will discuss possibility of NM
   consult today to determine prognosis. Recommended considering MRI
   possibly to evaluate for stroke as CT not as sensitive for this.
   - Continue off sedation
   -Improvement in muscle strength. Extubation today given improved NIF,
   good cough
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating.  Seems to be related to
   weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT.  Per
   respiratory notes from this morning, patient does have very good cough.
   NIF -28.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -Extubation today
   -if fails extubation will need trach
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: currently NPO for planned extubation this morning.
   -OG tube will be removed when extubated
   -Will evaluate swallowing once extubated
   -If swallowing well, will ADAT; if not, will insert NGT for tube
   feeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). He has been in the ICU due to progressive respiratory decline, hypotension, persistent fevers, and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications, including potential line infection, sinusitis, generalized weakness (likely due to myopathy), respiratory failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, coffee ground emesis, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, fecal incontinence, and pressure ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for possible line infection, but central line removal did not show any growth. Surveillance cultures remain negative.
2. Sinusitis: The patient is being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays for CT findings concerning for sinusitis.
3. Generalized weakness: The patient's weakness improved when sedation was weaned off, and muscle strength has improved. A neurology consult is recommended to determine the prognosis and consider an MRI to evaluate for stroke.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and tolerating it well. NIF has improved to -28, indicating better respiratory function. Extubation is planned today.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Possible line infection with 2/2 blood cultures
   for GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**7-11**]
   (started [**2190-12-2**]), surveillence cultures pending.  Central line
   removed, no growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis
   being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA,
   small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - line holiday, will need PICC if continues to require [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold
   for now given that he only needs 1 more day of [**First Name3 (LF) 114**].
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - Continue augmentin (day [**5-11**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy. Feel [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] very unlikely.   Weakness improved
   somewhat when sedation weaned off.  Some respiratory weakness as
   demonstrated by NIF, yesterday -23, today -28, so improving.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process. Spoke with neuro yesterday, will discuss possibility of NM
   consult today to determine prognosis. Recommended considering MRI
   possibly to evaluate for stroke as CT not as sensitive for this.
   - Continue off sedation
   -Improvement in muscle strength. Extubation today given improved NIF,
   good cough
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating.  Seems to be related to
   weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT.  Per
   respiratory notes from this morning, patient does have very good cough.
   NIF -28.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -Extubation today
   -if fails extubation will need trach
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: currently NPO for planned extubation this morning.
   -OG tube will be removed when extubated
   -Will evaluate swallowing once extubated
   -If swallowing well, will ADAT; if not, will insert NGT for tube
   feeding
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.
   # ACCESS: Aline, PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia and coffee ground emesis. He was initially treated for a urinary tract infection (URI) and was intubated due to progressive respiratory decline and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, and generalized weakness. His labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating possible infection. The CT scan of his chest shows no evidence of pneumonia, but there is concern for sinusitis. The patient has had several blood cultures taken and surveillance cultures remain negative to date. Central line removal was done, with no growth found on the tip.

The patient's weakness improved somewhat when sedation was weaned off, and respiratory weakness is demonstrated by negative inspiratory force (NIF). Head CT shows no acute intracranial process, and the neurologist recommended considering an MRI to evaluate for stroke, as the CT is not as sensitive for this. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, and he is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). He had a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), indicating readiness for extubation. If extubation fails, the patient may require a tracheostomy.

The patient's sodium level was initially high but has resolved with free water administration. He experienced one episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR"

   # Persistent fevers: Fever curve is improving and he is now afebrile.
   Being treated with vancomycin for MRSE and augmentin for suspected
   sinusitis.  Being treated with vancomycin day [**8-10**] (started [**2190-12-2**]),
   no further cultures positive to date so we can stop it today.  Central
   line removed.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis being treated with
   Augmentin and nasal sprays.  Also, ENT evaluated for PTA, small
   abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Last fever [**2190-12-3**]
   100.5.  CT chest without evidence of PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - d/c vanc today.
   - Continue augmentin (day [**6-10**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Hypertension: Very hypertensive this morning.  On Methyldopa and
   Diltiazam.  We would like to transition him back towards his home
   medications, adding metoprolol as he is also tachycardic.
   - Continue diltiazem and start metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **].  If tolerated we
   can titrate metoprolol up quickly.  Once pressures are controlled,
   hopefully we can stop the diltiazem
    - restart losartan at reduced dose of 25mg daily, with plan to titrate
   back up to home dose.
   - continue methyldopa
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems
   increasingly likely.  Continue to monitor clinical exam.
    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with diltiazem and starting
   metoprolol.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given high CHADS
   score, though we are holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Now with persistent fevers and altered mental status.
   # Persistent fevers: Fever trend improving.  Being treated with
   vancomycin for MRSE and augmentin for suspected sinusitis.
   Possible line infection with 2/2 blood cultures for GPC in pairs and
   clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**8-10**] (started [**2190-12-2**]), no
   further cultures positive to date.  Central line removed.  Also CT
   concerning for sinusitis being treated with Augmentin and nasal
   sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA, small abscess, attempted drainage, none
   aspirated.  last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - Continue augmentin (day [**6-10**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process. Spoke
   with neuro yesterday, will discuss possibility of NM consult today to
   determine prognosis. Recommended considering MRI possibly to evaluate
   for stroke as CT not as sensitive for this.
   - Continue off sedation
   -Improvement in muscle strength. Extubation today given improved NIF,
   good cough
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating.  Seems to be related to
   weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT.  Per
   respiratory notes from this morning, patient does have very good cough.
   NIF -28.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -Extubation today
   -if fails extubation will need trach
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: currently NPO for planned extubation this morning.
   -OG tube will be removed when extubated
   -Will evaluate swallowing once extubated
   -If swallowing well, will ADAT; if not, will insert NGT for tube
   feeding
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.
   # ACCESS: Aline, PIV
   # CODE STATUS: full
   # DISPO: ICU until extubation successful

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal bleed. He presented with hypoxia, coffee-ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient was intubated due to acute respiratory failure and developed fevers and altered mental status. He has been treated with vancomycin for MRSE and augmentin for suspected sinusitis. The patient's blood cultures were positive for GPC in pairs and clusters, which may indicate a possible line infection. His central line has been removed, and he is being treated with vancomycin for a total of 7 days as per ID recommendations. The patient's respiratory strength has improved, and he has been extubated successfully. However, he still requires ongoing neurologic evaluation and assessment. His electrolyte and fluid disorder has resolved, and he is currently receiving free water at 250cc q4hrs. The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is now rate-controlled with diltiazem. He is also being monitored for hypertension and hypernatremia. The patient's coffee-ground emesis is likely due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed, and further evaluation with a colonoscopy is planned when he is stable. He has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2-1.4. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with glargine 14U qhs, and metformin has been held due to increased creatinine levels. The patient's feeding regimen will be adjusted once he is extubated and able to swallow. He will continue to receive pneumoboots and heparin subcutaneously. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU until extubation is successful. Emergency contact information has been provided."

   for GPC in pairs and clusters, being treated with vancomycin day [**7-11**]
   (started [**2190-12-2**]), surveillence cultures pending.  Central line
   removed, no growth to date from tip.  Also CT concerning for sinusitis
   being treated with Augmentin and nasal sprays.  ENT evaluated for PTA,
   small abscess, attempted drainage, none aspirated.  Low grade fevers on
   Tylenol --> last fever [**2190-12-3**] 100.5.  CT chest without evidence of
   PNA.
   - surviellence cultures --> [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] remain negative to date
   - line holiday, will need PICC if continues to require [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold
   for now given that he only needs 1 more day of [**First Name3 (LF) 114**].
   - continue vanc for total of 7 days per ID recs
   - Continue augmentin (day [**5-11**]), continue fluticasone and saline nasal
   sprays
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy. Feel [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] very unlikely.   Weakness improved
   somewhat when sedation weaned off.  Some respiratory weakness as
   demonstrated by NIF, yesterday -23, today -28, so improving.  H/o
   dysphagia prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial
   process. Spoke with neuro yesterday, will discuss possibility of NM
   consult today to determine prognosis. Recommended considering MRI
   possibly to evaluate for stroke as CT not as sensitive for this.
   - Continue off sedation
   -Improvement in muscle strength. Extubation today given improved NIF,
   good cough
    # Respiratory failure: On [**6-8**] PSV, tolerating.  Seems to be related to
   weakness as the CT is concerning for atelectasis and chronic
   aspiaration, however PNA unlikely. Did well on last SBT.  Per
   respiratory notes from this morning, patient does have very good cough.
   NIF -28.
   - wean vent as tolerated --> try to wean pressure support first
   -  SBT
   -Extubation today
   -if fails extubation will need trach
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - currently getting free water at 250cc q4hrs
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode with likely precipitants
   include fluid overload and HTN.  No prior hx of afib.  Now rate
   controlled with diltiazem.  Will likely require anti-coagulation given
   high CHADS score, holding off for now given recent GI bleed.
   - Continue Dilt TID and watch HR/rhythm
   # HTN: BP stable.  On Methyldopa and Diltiazam.
   - Hold Cozaar and HCTZ
   - continue Dilt
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr at baseline of 1.2-1.4 with fluid
   re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 14U qhs.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: currently NPO for planned extubation this morning.
   -OG tube will be removed when extubated
   -Will evaluate swallowing once extubated
   -If swallowing well, will ADAT; if not, will insert NGT for tube
   feeding
   # PPX:
   - PO PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has had increasing WBC count, yesterday 11.3,
   today 12.1. Afebrile. Concerning in the setting of new symptoms of neck
   pain and black sputum. Was started yesterday on Ceftraixone and
   continued on Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis.
   CT head and neck done, shows improvement of PTA. Treated with
   vancomycin for MRSE (completed [**8-10**] day course) and augmentin for
   suspected sinusitis (completed 5 day course). Vancomycin started
   [**2190-12-2**].  Patient does appear to continue to have neck pain. Per
   nursing also appears more delirious over night.
   -Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   -MRI of head to assess for soft tissue lesions
   -LP today
   # Hypertension: Continues hypertensive, max BP 199/137; improved from
   day before.  On metoprolol 75 mg PO/NG TID and Lostartan 25 mg PO/NG
   daily. Diltiazem was d/c
d yesterday.  Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **],
   Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily appears to be home medication
   regimen.
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg PO TID
    - restart losartan at reduced dose of 25mg daily, titrate up today to
   50 mg daily.
   - continue methyldopa
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems
   increasingly likely.
   -Continue to monitor clinical exam
    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with metoprolol.  Will likely require
   anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, though we are holding off for
   now given recent GI bleed.
   -Continue metoprolol
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who presents with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient was previously intubated due to weakness but is now extubated. The patient has neck pain and black sputum, indicating potential complications such as a cervical vertebrae process or infection.

The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, from 11.3 yesterday to 12.1 today, which raises concerns for an infection. The patient was started on Ceftriaxone and continued on Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis. A CT head and neck showed improvement of PTA but the patient continues to have neck pain. The patient appears more delirious overnight.

The patient's hypertension is still present, with a maximum blood pressure of 199/137. The patient is on metoprolol 75 mg PO TID, losartan 25 mg PO/NG daily, and methyldopa. The doses of metoprolol and losartan will be continued, with a plan to titrate up the losartan to 50 mg daily.

The patient's generalized weakness evaluated by neurology is likely due to myopathy, especially since the patient is improving now that he is extubated. The head CT shows no acute intracranial process.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved since"

The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection. He has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, dysphagia, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient underwent intubation due to respiratory failure and weakness but was subsequently extubated. He presented with neck pain and black sputum, indicating a potential infection. The patient has been started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for empirical coverage of possible meningitis and sinusitis. A CT scan of the head and neck showed improvement of a previous tonsillar pillar abscess. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to multiple factors such as age, underlying health conditions, and medications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's general weakness and prolonged immobility due to intubation may lead to skin breakdown or pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are essential for early detection and prevention.
3. Peripheral Neuropathy: The patient's generalized weakness could be due to myopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Further evaluation by a neurologist is recommended to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate management.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's"

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has had increasing WBC count, yesterday 11.3,
   today 12.1. Afebrile. Concerning in the setting of new symptoms of neck
   pain and black sputum. Was started yesterday on Ceftraixone and
   continued on Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis.
   CT head and neck done, shows improvement of PTA; however, sinus
   infection appears worse. Treated with vancomycin for MRSE (completed
   [**8-10**] day course) and augmentin for suspected sinusitis (completed 5 day
   course). Vancomycin started [**2190-12-2**].  Patient does appear to continue
   to have neck pain. Per nursing also appears more delirious over night.
   -Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   -MRI of head to assess for soft tissue lesions
   -LP if MRI negative
   #Delerium:? Sundowning last night. Concern if this could be related to
   infection. Patient should be up during the day to chair to minimize
   awakening at night.
   -PT consult to get patient OOB
   -Consider re-consulting ENT given that sinusitis not improved
   # Hypertension: Continues hypertensive, max BP 199/137; improved from
   day before.  On metoprolol 75 mg PO/NG TID and Lostartan 25 mg PO/NG
   daily. Diltiazem was d/c
d yesterday.  Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **],
   Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily appears to be home medication
   regimen.
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg PO TID
    - restart losartan at reduced dose of 25mg daily, titrate up today to
   50 mg daily.
   - continue methyldopa
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems
   increasingly likely.
   -Continue to monitor clinical exam
    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with metoprolol.  Will likely require
   anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, though we are holding off for
   now given recent GI bleed.
   -Continue metoprolol
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems

    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with metoprolol.  Will likely require
   anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, though we are holding off for
   now given recent GI bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes type II, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He presents with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and urinary tract infection. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but is now extubated and producing copious secretions. He has neck pain and black sputum, indicating a possible infection. The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and altered mental status, raising concerns for meningitis or delirium. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is hypertensive. The patient's weakness is attributed to myopathy, but further investigation is needed to rule out other causes such as stroke or epidural abscess. His chronic renal insufficiency requires careful management of fluids and medications. The patient's diabetes management involves sliding scale insulin and holding metformin. He is on a regular diet with thickened liquids and bowel regimen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status suggest a possible infection, which could be meningitis or delirium. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.
2. Myopathy: The patient's generalized weakness is likely due to myopathy, but it is important to rule out other potential causes such as stroke or epidural abscess.

   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has had increasing WBC count, yesterday 11.3,
   today 12.1. Afebrile. Concerning in the setting of new symptoms of neck
   pain and black sputum. Was started yesterday on Ceftraixone and
   continued on Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis.
   CT head and neck done, shows improvement of PTA. Treated with
   vancomycin for MRSE (completed [**8-10**] day course) and augmentin for
   suspected sinusitis (completed 5 day course). Vancomycin started
   [**2190-12-2**].
   -Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   -MRI of head to assess for soft tissue lesions
   -LP today
   # Hypertension: Continues hypertensive, max BP 199/137; improved from
   day before.  On metoprolol 75 mg PO/NG TID and Lostartan 25 mg PO/NG
   daily. Diltiazem was d/c
d yesterday.  Alpha-Methyldopa 500mg tabs [**Hospital1 **],
   Cozaar 100mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily appears to be home medication
   regimen.
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg PO TID
    - restart losartan at reduced dose of 25mg daily, titrate up today to
   50 mg daily.
   - continue methyldopa
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems
   increasingly likely.
   -Continue to monitor clinical exam
    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with metoprolol.  Will likely require
   anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, though we are holding off for
   now given recent GI bleed.
   -Continue metoprolol
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   - Continue Glargine
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient presents hypoxic with coffee ground emesis, upper respiratory infection (URI), progressive declining respiratory status, and hypotension. He was extubated after prolonged intubation due to weakness and now complains of neck pain.

The patient has leukocytosis with increasing WBC count, suggesting an infection. He was started on Ceftriaxone and continued on Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis. A CT head and neck showed improvement of PTA and treated with vancomycin for MRSE (completed an 8-10 day course) and augmentin for suspected sinusitis (completed a 5-day course). Vancomycin was started on [**2190-12-2**].

The patient also has hypertension, which is not well-controlled despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. His blood pressure remains elevated, reaching up to 199/137 mmHg. He is currently on metoprolol and losartan.

The patient has generalized weakness, evaluated by a neurologist who believed it to be due to myopathy. Respiratory strength appears to be improving now that he is extubated. He has a history of dysphagia prior to hospitalization. A head CT shows no acute intracranial process.

The patient experienced respiratory failure, but is now extubated with good"

   Chief Complaint: Difficulty clearing secretions/diffuse weakness
   24 Hour Events:
   - Seen by ENT who got aerobic, anaerobic and fungal cultures.  They
   thought he had some nasal discharge consistent with acute bacterial
   sinusitis, but no evidence of fungal invasive sinusitis.
   - Seen again by speech and swallow, who thought he had improved.  They
   would like a video swallow to assess further.
   - MR ordered but not done yet.
   - Losartan increased to 50mg daily with improvement.
   - LFTs show mildly elevated AST and lipase.
   - Went down to MRI but coughed excessively when lying flat. Did not get
   scan and came back up right away.

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Steadily increasing leukocytosis, today to 13.2.
   This morning had low-grade fever during rounds and looks more tired
   than previously.  His neck pain has improved and the one source that we
   have at this point is his sinusitis that appeared worsened on his most
   recent CT scan, though he may have aspirated and have a pneumonitis.
   His delirium has improved, and a CSF source seems very unlikely.  We
   will continue his augmentin for the time being, given that he remains
   febrile and we may place a dobhoff later today, as discussed below.
   - Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative
   staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  He did have a h/o dysphagia
   prior to hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process
   though neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may
   in fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   -Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   -Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   #Delerium:? Sundowning last night. Concern if this could be related to
   infection. Patient should be up during the day to chair to minimize
   awakening at night.
   -PT consult to get patient OOB
   -Consider re-consulting ENT given that sinusitis not improved
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Chief Complaint: Difficulty clearing secretions/diffuse weakness
   - The patient has difficulty clearing secretions and experiences diffuse weakness.
   - This could be due to impaired respiratory function and muscle performance.

2. 24-hour events:
   - The patient was seen by ENT who diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis.
   - Sinusitis may worsen over time, leading to increased nasal discharge and potential complications like a sinus infection or pneumonia.
   - The patient was also seen by speech and swallow specialists who thought he had improved.
   - A video swallow assessment is recommended to further evaluate swallowing difficulties.
   - MR (likely magnetic resonance) was ordered but not done yet.
   - The patient's medication, losartan, was increased to 50mg daily with improvement.
   - LFTs (liver function tests) show mildly elevated AST and lipase.
   - The patient attempted an MRI but coughed excessively when lying flat, resulting in not completing the scan.
   - Allergies include Zestril (Lisinopril) and cough.
   - The patient received ceftriaxone and vancomycin as antibiotics.
   - Heparin sodium was administered as a prophylaxis.

3. Review of Systems:
   - The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:
     - Flowsheet data as of [2190-12-10] 07:20 AM.
   - Vital signs: Temperature (Tmax: 36.9°C), Tcurrent: 36.4°C, Heart rate (HR): 84 bpm, Blood pressure (BP): 145/59mmHg, Respiratory rate (RR): 21 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 96%, Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm.
   - Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's weight is 78.1 kg, with a total fluid intake of 805 mL and output of 1710 mL.
   - Fluid balance: The patient has a negative balance of 905 mL.
   - Respiratory support: The patient is on nasal cannula with SpO2 at 96% and ABG results of ///30/.
   - Physical examination: Peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments were not performed.
   - Labs/Radiology: Blood test results include WBC 11.0 K/uL, Hematocrit 25.3%, Platelet count 448, Creatinine 1.3, Blood glucose levels, Electrolyte levels, etc.

   Afebrile. Concerning in the setting of new symptoms of neck pain and
   black sputum. Was started yesterday on Ceftraixone and continued on
   Vancomycin for empiric coverage for possible meningitis.  CT head and
   neck done, shows improvement of PTA; however, sinus infection appears
   worse. Treated with vancomycin for MRSE (completed [**8-10**] day course) and
   augmentin for suspected sinusitis (completed 5 day course). Vancomycin
   started [**2190-12-2**].  Patient does appear to continue to have neck pain.
   Per nursing also appears more delirious over night.

   50 mg daily.
   - continue methyldopa
   # Weakness: Generalized weakness, evaluated by neuro who felt likely
   due to myopathy.  Respiratory strength appears to be improving,
   especially now that he is extubated.  H/o dysphagia prior to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.  The
   diagnosis of myopathy in the setting of severe illness seems
   increasingly likely.
   -Continue to monitor clinical exam
    # Respiratory failure: Now extubated with good O2 saturations.  He
   continues to produce copious secretions, but clears them well with
   coughing.
   #Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Today he is tachycardic but in sinus rhythm.  No prior
   hx of afib.  Now rate controlled with metoprolol.  Will likely require
   anti-coagulation given high CHADS score, though we are holding off for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male presenting with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. He was initially intubated due to declining respiratory status and hypotension but has since been extubated. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Balance: The patient has impaired balance, which could increase the risk of falls and injuries.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, especially in the evening (sundowning), which may be related to infection or other underlying conditions.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by black sputum and positive guaiac test. Further evaluation with colonoscopy is recommended.
4. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the production of copious secretions. Monitoring and ensuring effective clearance of secretions are essential.
5. Hypertension: The patient continues to be hypertensive, requiring medication adjustments and monitoring.
6. Myopathy: The patient's generalized weakness is suspected to be due to myopathy, especially considering his severe illness and the absence of an acute intracranial process on head CT.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced an episode"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of pneumonia. They have a history of allergies to Lisinopril and cough. The patient is currently on antibiotics for sinusitis and has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and Augmentin. They are also receiving nutrition through a Duobef today.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/108 to 174/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's weight is 78.1 kg, with a total input of 805 mL and output of 1,710 mL.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and has poor dentition. They have cervical lymphadenopathy, normal cardiovascular findings, and no peripheral edema. The respiratory examination shows crackles in the mid inspiratory phase, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, with purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia"

   24 Hour Events:
   - NGT placed, then he pulled it out, attempted to replace several times
   unsuccessfully, given 1L NS overnight since he has not been taking in
   PO and UOP decreased
   - Neuro called about dysphagia. Feel that this could not be related to
   stroke b/c if a stroke would be in medulla and he would have sig more
   sx and be less alert. They would like a video swallow study in order to
   fully evaluate etiology of dysphagia.
   - Seems to be weaker and not tolerating secretions as well, needs to
   have a discussion about trach/peg while he is still alert, niece should
   be coming this weekend.

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Steadily increasing leukocytosis, today to 13.2.
   Fever last night to 101.3, cultures resent.  This morning had low-grade
   fever during rounds and looks more tired than previously.  His neck
   pain has improved and the one source that we have at this point is his
   sinusitis that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan, though he
   may have aspirated and have a pneumonitis.  His delirium has improved,
   and a CSF source seems very unlikely.  Augmentin -> Unasyn, given that
   he remains febrile.  Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of
   coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.  Change
   to Unasyn given unable to take PO augmentin.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  Video swallowing suggests
   neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior  to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process though
   neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may in
   fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   - Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   - Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection symptoms. He was initially intubated due to weakness but was extubated because of neck pain. The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral neuropathy.

24-hour events:
- The patient attempted to remove his nasogastric tube multiple times and was unsuccessful.
- He received 1 liter of normal saline overnight as he was not taking in anything orally.
- His urine output decreased.
- Neurology called regarding dysphagia and suggested a video swallow study to evaluate the cause.
- The patient appears weaker and is having difficulty tolerating secretions, with a discussion about tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement being considered.
- He has a fever and leukocytosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is unable to take oral nutrition due to dysphagia and weak swallowing ability.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection.
3. Balance: The patient has impaired balance, which could be due to weakness or other underlying conditions.
4. Gait: The patient has impaired gait, potentially related to his balance issues and overall weakness.
5. Knowledge: The patient"

   24 Hour Events:
   - NGT placed, then he pulled it out, attempted to replace several times
   unsuccessfully, given 1L NS overnight since he has not been taking in
   PO and UOP decreased
   - Neuro called about dysphagia. Feel that this could not be related to
   stroke b/c if a stroke would be in medulla and he would have sig more
   sx and be less alert. They would like a video swallow study in order to
   fully evaluate etiology of dysphagia.
   - Seems to be weaker and not tolerating secretions as well, needs to
   have a discussion about trach/peg while he is still alert, niece should
   be coming this weekend.

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Steadily increasing leukocytosis, today to 13.2.
   Fever last night to 101.3, cultures resent.  This morning had low-grade
   fever during rounds and looks more tired than previously.  His neck
   pain has improved and the one source that we have at this point is his
   sinusitis that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan, though he
   may have aspirated and have a pneumonitis.  His delirium has improved,
   and a CSF source seems very unlikely.  Augmentin -> Unasyn, given that
   he remains febrile.  Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of
   coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.  Change
   to Unasyn given unable to take PO augmentin.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  Video swallowing suggests
   neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior  to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process though
   neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may in
   fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   - Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   - Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presents with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection symptoms. He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient has been experiencing weakness, impaired respiration, impaired delirium, and impaired transfers. He also has leukocytosis, fever, and sinusitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is at high risk of aspiration due to his impaired ability to clear secretions and neurological dysfunction. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining, which may lead to acute respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion can progress to delirium, which can affect his overall recovery and increase the risk of complications such as falls and infections.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and his condition may worsen if adequate fluid balance is not maintained.
5. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently controlled, it needs to be monitored closely to prevent any complications related to high blood pressure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be further investigated and managed appropriately.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to"

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Steadily increasing leukocytosis, today to 13.2.
   Fever last night to 101.3, cultures resent.  This morning had low-grade
   fever during rounds and looks more tired than previously.  His neck
   pain has improved and the one source that we have at this point is his
   sinusitis that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan, though he
   may have aspirated and have a pneumonitis.  His delirium has improved,
   and a CSF source seems very unlikely.  Augmentin -> Unasyn, given that
   he remains febrile.  Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of
   coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.  Change
   to Unasyn given unable to take PO augmentin.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  Video swallowing suggests
   neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior  to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process though
   neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may in
   fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   - Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   - Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection. He has been experiencing progressive respiratory decline, weakness, and fever. The patient was intubated but is now extubated due to weakness. He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of aspiration due to his inability to clear secretions and impaired swallowing. This can lead to pneumonia.
2. Sinusitis: The patient has been diagnosed with worsening sinusitis, which may contribute to his ongoing febrile state.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which could be attributed to his underlying medical conditions or potential medication side effects.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and he may require further respiratory support.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has coffee ground emesis and trace guaiac positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a pre-existing condition of chronic renal insufficiency, which may worsen due to fluid overload or medication use.
7. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, and his glycemic control should be monitored closely.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs"

   with neck pain.
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems
   localized to wrist and thumb.  LUE U/S yesterday was negative.  Ddx is
   infectious vs gout.  Gout could also explain his mild leukocytosis and
   low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except for degenerative
   changes.
   - Rhematology consult.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Very slowly increasing leukocytosis, today to
   13.7.  Low-grade fevers only last night to 100.7.  His neck pain has
   improved and the one source that we have at this point is his sinusitis
   that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan.  Augmentin -> Unasyn
   in the setting of inconsistent PO access and missed doses.  Completed 7
   days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Plan for 14-day course of augmentin/Unasyn.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: His respiratory status has improved
   now that he is NPO, suggesting that he may have been chronically
   coughing on food.  If he is to remain NPO, he may require PEG placement
   in the long run.  Though his generalized strength has improved, he
   continues to be unable to clear his secretions.  Video swallowing
   suggests neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior to
   hospitalization.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every 15-20
   minutes.
   - Dobhoff in place for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] require soft restraints at night to
   prevent from pulling dobhoff again.
   - Discuss possible PEG with patient.
   - Re-consult neurology as to source of persistently depressed gag
   reflex.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   # Hypertension: Has been responding to increasing doses of
   antihypertensives.  Yesterday could only receive POs for part of the
   day so he did not receive all of his medications so we will not make
   changes today.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 75mg daily.

   77 yo male who presents hypoxic in the setting of coffee ground emesis
   and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension.
   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Very slowly increasing leukocytosis, today to
   13.7.  Low-grade fevers only last night to 100.7.  His neck pain has
   improved and the one source that we have at this point is his sinusitis
   that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan, though he may have
   aspirated and have a pneumonitis.  His delirium has improved, and a CSF
   source seems very unlikely.  Augmentin -> Unasyn, given that he remains
   febrile.  Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag
   negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.  Change
   to Unasyn given unable to take PO augmentin.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  Video swallowing suggests
   neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior  to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process though
   neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may in
   fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   - Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   - Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical complications and conditions. The patient presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI), and has been experiencing progressive respiratory decline and hypotension. 

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has slowly increasing leukocytosis and low-grade fevers. His neck pain has improved, and a sinusitis diagnosis is suspected. Aspiration and pneumonitis are also possibilities.

2. Weakness/respiratory difficulty: The patient is unable to clear secretions and is at high risk of aspiration. A neurologic etiology may be causing the respiratory issues, which may have been present before hospitalization. A head CT shows no acute intracranial process, but the neurology team is concerned about a possible past stroke. The patient may eventually need a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition and secretion management.

3. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection is present, but a left upper extremity ultrasound has been ordered to evaluate for thrombus.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is under control with increasing doses of losartan. Metoprolol has been continued at 75mg daily.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient had one episode"

   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now

   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Very slowly increasing leukocytosis, today to
   13.7.  Low-grade fevers only last night to 100.7.  His neck pain has

   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.  Change
   to Unasyn given unable to take PO augmentin.
   - Check CXR today to assess for aspiration.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: Though his generalized strength has
   improved, he has continues to be unable to clear his secretions and is
   at extremely high risk of aspiration.  Video swallowing suggests
   neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior  to
   hospitalization. Head CT shows no acute intracranial process though
   neurology continues to be worried about a past stroke, which may in
   fact be the case.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every
   15-20 minutes.  If his weakness persists he may eventually need a
   tracheostomy and PEG placement, simply to provide nutrition while he
   cannot clear his secretions.  We will place a dobhoff for now.
   - Begin to discuss trach and PEG as a possibility with patient.
   - Dobhoff placement for now.  NPO until that is placed.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Hypertension: Improved control with increasing losartan.  Still has
   room to increase to 75mg daily.  Home dose was 100mg daily.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr better than baseline of 1.2-1.4 with
   fluid re-hydration.
   -Trend creatinines daily
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
   -Will hold on further IVF's for now as Cr at baseline and LOS is up 15L
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient initially presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He was intubated due to weakness but was extubated after improvement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. The source of infection seems to be worsening sinusitis, which may have led to aspiration and pneumonitis. Antibiotics have been changed to Unasyn due to inability to take oral augmentin.
2. Weakness/respiratory difficulty: The patient continues to have difficulty clearing secretions and is at high risk of aspiration. He may require a tracheostomy and PEG placement for nutrition and respiratory support. A Dobhoff placement has been initiated.
3. L wrist pain and edema: The patient has pain and swelling in his left wrist without signs of infection. A left upper extremity ultrasound has been ordered to evaluate for thrombus.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being controlled with increasing doses of losartan. Metoprolol has been increased to 75 mg daily.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation likely due to fluid overload. He is currently in sinus rhythm, and ant"

   #. Gout: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems localized to wrist
   and thumb.  LUE U/S [**12-11**] was negative.  Gout could also explain his
   mild leukocytosis and low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except
   for degenerative changes. Foot finding of podagra per rheumatology
   classic for gout, did need tap of joint.
   - Prednisone 20 mg PO daily x3 days
   -F/u uric acid in 4 weeks as this can be falsely normal in acute gout.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis slowly improving, afebrile yesterday
   in the setting of prednisone yesterday for gout. Gout may explain
   leukocytosis as well as low grade fevers.   His neck pain has improved,
   sinusitis appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan.  Augmentin ->
   Unasyn in the setting of inconsistent PO access and missed doses.
   Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Plan for 14-day course of augmentin/Unasyn.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: His respiratory status has improved
   now that he is NPO, suggesting that he may have been chronically
   coughing on food.  If he is to remain NPO, he may require PEG placement
   in the long run.  Though his generalized strength has improved, he
   continues to be unable to clear his secretions.  Video swallowing
   suggests neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior to
   hospitalization.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every 15-20
   minutes.  Neurology plans to assess his weakness and difficulty
   swallowing further today
   - Dobhoff in place for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] require soft restraints at night to
   prevent from pulling dobhoff again.
   - Patient amenable to PEG if neuro feels swallowing will not improve
   quickly
   - F/u neurology as to source of persistently depressed gag reflex.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   # Hypertension: Has been responding to increasing doses of
   antihypertensives.  Yesterday could only receive POs for part of the
   day so he did not receive all of his medications so we will not make
   changes today.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 100mg daily.
   -add HCTZ tomorrow if necessary to control blood pressure and restart
   home regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr stable at 0.9, which is his baseline.
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents

","The patient is a 77-year-old male who presents with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. He was intubated due to weakness but has since been extubated. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, gout, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and he has impaired gas exchange. This could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to delirium or confusion. This can increase the risk of falls, difficulty in eating, and increased risk of infection.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor nutrition.

4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has chronic renal failure, which puts him at risk for electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorders. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is necessary.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has coffee ground emesis and a history of chronic kidney disease. These findings suggest a potential gastrointestinal bleed, which needs further evaluation and management.

   #. Gout: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems localized to wrist
   and thumb.  LUE U/S [**12-11**] was negative.  Gout could also explain his
   mild leukocytosis and low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except
   for degenerative changes. Foot finding of podagra per rheumatology
   classic for gout, did need tap of joint.
   - Prednisone 20 mg PO daily x3 days
   -F/u uric acid in 4 weeks as this can be falsely normal in acute gout.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis slowly improving, afebrile yesterday
   in the setting of prednisone yesterday for gout. Gout may explain
   leukocytosis as well as low grade fevers.   His neck pain has improved,
   sinusitis appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan.  Augmentin ->
   Unasyn in the setting of inconsistent PO access and missed doses.
   Completed 7 days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Plan for 14-day course of augmentin/Unasyn.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: His respiratory status has improved
   now that he is NPO, suggesting that he may have been chronically
   coughing on food.  If he is to remain NPO, he may require PEG placement
   in the long run.  Though his generalized strength has improved, he
   continues to be unable to clear his secretions.  Video swallowing
   suggests neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior to
   hospitalization.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every 15-20
   minutes.  Neurology plans to assess his weakness and difficulty
   swallowing further today
   - Dobhoff in place for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] require soft restraints at night to
   prevent from pulling dobhoff again.
   - Patient amenable to PEG if neuro feels swallowing will not improve
   quickly
   - F/u neurology as to source of persistently depressed gag reflex.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   # Hypertension: Has been responding to increasing doses of
   antihypertensives.  Yesterday could only receive POs for part of the
   day so he did not receive all of his medications so we will not make
   changes today.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 100mg daily.
   -add HCTZ tomorrow if necessary to control blood pressure and restart
   home regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr stable at 0.9, which is his baseline.
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient was extubated after prolonged intubation due to weakness. He continues to have impaired nutrition, leukocytosis, balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, transfers, delirium/confusion, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), impaired skin integrity, peripheral neuropathy, chronic renal failure, benign hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, and respiratory failure. The patient also has altered mental status, electrolyte/fluid disorder, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gout: The patient has been diagnosed with gout, evidenced by swollen great toe and degenerative changes in the hand. He has been started on prednisone for gout treatment.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be explained by gout or an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Fever: The patient has experienced low-grade fevers, which could be related to gout or an ongoing infection. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Respiratory difficulties: The patient continues to have respiratory issues, including impaired gas exchange and persistent cough. This may be due to chronic coughing on food or neurologic"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Pulled NGT early in the am and another placed
   - Hand and wrist films showed degenerative changes but no acute
   process.
   - Seen by rheumatology, also had swollen left great toe, clinically
   gout, did not feel a joint tap was necessary.  Started on 20mg
   prednisone.
   - Rheum recommended repeat uric acid level in 4 weeks, can be falsely
   normal in acute gout.
   - Seen by weekend neurology team. Not an 'acute'
   - Spoke to him about PEG tube.  He wanted to hear what neurology
   thought first, but then would be willing if we thought a PEG tube was
   necessary.
   - Hypertensive to 175/81 at 11pm after receiving all meds.  Gave 1-time
   dose of 25mg of losartan with plan to go up to 100mg tomorrow.  Could
   also reconsider adding back home HCTZ.

   Patient extubated after prolonged intubation because of weakness; now
   with neck pain.
   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems
   localized to wrist and thumb.  LUE U/S yesterday was negative.  Ddx is
   infectious vs gout.  Gout could also explain his mild leukocytosis and
   low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except for degenerative
   changes.
   - Rhematology consult.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Very slowly increasing leukocytosis, today to
   13.7.  Low-grade fevers only last night to 100.7.  His neck pain has
   improved and the one source that we have at this point is his sinusitis
   that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan.  Augmentin -> Unasyn
   in the setting of inconsistent PO access and missed doses.  Completed 7
   days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Plan for 14-day course of augmentin/Unasyn.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: His respiratory status has improved
   now that he is NPO, suggesting that he may have been chronically
   coughing on food.  If he is to remain NPO, he may require PEG placement
   in the long run.  Though his generalized strength has improved, he
   continues to be unable to clear his secretions.  Video swallowing
   suggests neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior to
   hospitalization.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every 15-20
   minutes.
   - Dobhoff in place for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] require soft restraints at night to
   prevent from pulling dobhoff again.
   - Discuss possible PEG with patient.
   - Re-consult neurology as to source of persistently depressed gag
   reflex.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   # Hypertension: Has been responding to increasing doses of
   antihypertensives.  Yesterday could only receive POs for part of the
   day so he did not receive all of his medications so we will not make
   changes today.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr stable at 1.2, which is his baseline.
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: on regular diet with thickened liquids

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. He was initially intubated due to respiratory failure and weakness but was extubated because of weakness as well. The patient complains of neck pain and left wrist pain with edema. He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral neuropathy. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved since being kept NPO (nothing by mouth), suggesting chronic coughing on food as a possible cause. He requires assistance clearing secretions and has difficulty sleeping due to frequent coughing. A video swallowing test suggests a neurologic etiology for his impaired gag reflex. 

The patient's leukocytosis and low-grade fevers could be attributed to infectious or gouty arthritis, as recommended by rheumatology. An ultrasound of the left upper extremity was negative for thrombus. 

His hypertension has been managed with increasing doses of antihypertensives. He had a single episode of atrial fibrillation but has been in sinus rhythm since then. 

The patient's coffee ground emesis was initially thought to be gastrointestinal bleeding, but upper endoscopy and NG lavage were negative. However, a trace guaiac positive result suggests ongoing small amounts of bleeding. A colonoscopy is planned when the patient is stable.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pulled NGT early in the am and another placed
   - Hand and wrist films showed degenerative changes but no acute
   process.
   - Seen by rheumatology, also had swollen left great toe, clinically
   gout, did not feel a joint tap was necessary.  Started on 20mg
   prednisone.
   - Rheum recommended repeat uric acid level in 4 weeks, can be falsely
   normal in acute gout.
   - Seen by weekend neurology team. Not an 'acute'
   - Spoke to him about PEG tube.  He wanted to hear what neurology
   thought first, but then would be willing if we thought a PEG tube was
   necessary.
   - Hypertensive to 175/81 at 11pm after receiving all meds.  Gave 1-time
   dose of 25mg of losartan with plan to go up to 100mg tomorrow.  Could
   also reconsider adding back home HCTZ.

   #. Gout: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems localized to wrist
   and thumb.  LUE U/S [**12-11**] was negative.  Gout could also explain his
   mild leukocytosis and low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except
   for degenerative changes. Foot finding of podagra per rheumatology
   classic for gout, did need tap of joint.
   - Prednisone 20 mg PO daily x3 days
   -F/u uric acid in 4 weeks as this can be falsely normal in acute gout.

   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 100mg daily.
   -add HCTZ tomorrow if necessary to control blood pressure and restart
   home regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr stable at 0.9, which is his baseline.
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.
   # FEN: TF
   # PPX:
   - On home PPI
   - bowel regimen (colace, senna, lactulose PRN)
   - pneumoboots and Heparin SC.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical complications.
- He presented with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms.
- He was intubated due to respiratory failure but was later extubated because of weakness.
- The patient has been diagnosed with gout, likely causing his mild leukocytosis and low-grade fevers. He was prescribed prednisone and will have a follow-up uric acid level in four weeks.
- His fever and leukocytosis have slowly improved, and he is now afebrile.
- The patient's neck pain has improved, but his sinusitis appeared worsened on the most recent CT scan. He was switched from fluticasone and saline nasal sprays to Augmentin/Unasyn for a 14-day course.
- His respiratory status has improved since being NPO (nothing by mouth), suggesting chronic coughing on food. He may require percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in the long run.
- The patient continues to have difficulty clearing secretions and has trouble sleeping due to coughing every 15-20 minutes. Neurology plans to assess his weakness and difficulty swallowing further.
- He has been placed on soft restraints at night to prevent pulling out the Dobhoff tube.
- The patient's hypertension has been"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pulled NGT early in the am and another placed
   - Hand and wrist films showed degenerative changes but no acute
   process.
   - Seen by rheumatology, also had swollen left great toe, clinically
   gout, did not feel a joint tap was necessary.  Started on 20mg
   prednisone.
   - Rheum recommended repeat uric acid level in 4 weeks, can be falsely
   normal in acute gout.
   - Seen by weekend neurology team. Not an 'acute'
   - Spoke to him about PEG tube.  He wanted to hear what neurology
   thought first, but then would be willing if we thought a PEG tube was
   necessary.
   - Hypertensive to 175/81 at 11pm after receiving all meds.  Gave 1-time
   dose of 25mg of losartan with plan to go up to 100mg tomorrow.  Could
   also reconsider adding back home HCTZ.

   #. L wrist pain and edema: No obvious infection overlying.  Pain seems
   localized to wrist and thumb.  LUE U/S yesterday was negative.  Ddx is
   infectious vs gout.  Gout could also explain his mild leukocytosis and
   low-grade fevers.  Hand films are normal except for degenerative
   changes.
   - Rhematology consult.
   - LUE u/s to eval for thrombus
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Very slowly increasing leukocytosis, today to
   13.7.  Low-grade fevers only last night to 100.7.  His neck pain has
   improved and the one source that we have at this point is his sinusitis
   that appeared worsened on his most recent CT scan.  Augmentin -> Unasyn
   in the setting of inconsistent PO access and missed doses.  Completed 7
   days of vancomycin for two bottles of coag negative staph.
   - Continue fluticasone and saline nasal sprays for ? sinusitis.
   - Plan for 14-day course of augmentin/Unasyn.
   # Weakness/respiratory difficulty: His respiratory status has improved
   now that he is NPO, suggesting that he may have been chronically
   coughing on food.  If he is to remain NPO, he may require PEG placement
   in the long run.  Though his generalized strength has improved, he
   continues to be unable to clear his secretions.  Video swallowing
   suggests neurologic etiology, this may have been present prior to
   hospitalization.  He has trouble sleeping because he coughs every 15-20
   minutes.
   - Dobhoff in place for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] require soft restraints at night to
   prevent from pulling dobhoff again.
   - Discuss possible PEG with patient.
   - Re-consult neurology as to source of persistently depressed gag
   reflex.
   - Keep him upright as much as possible.
   - MRI/MRA when able
   # Hypertension: Has been responding to increasing doses of
   antihypertensives.  Yesterday could only receive POs for part of the
   day so he did not receive all of his medications so we will not make
   changes today.
   - continue metoprolol 75mg TID and losartan 75mg daily.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR
 Had one episode of afib in the setting of
   fluid overload.  Since he has been in sinus rhythm.  A fib was likely
   due to fluid overload.  We will continue to monitor, but he will likely
   not require anticoagulation.
    # Coffee ground emesis: Upper endoscopy and NG lavage negative, trace
   guiaic positive.  Hematocrit now stable.  Needs colonoscopy when
   stable.
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr stable at 1.2, which is his baseline.
   -Avoid hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic agents
    # DMII: Glargine 10U qhs with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Metformin held in setting of increased Cr and requiring scans.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with hypoxia, coffee ground emesis, and a history of URI with progressive declining respiratory status and hypotension. The patient was intubated but extubated due to weakness. He has wrist pain and edema, fever, leukocytosis, and sinusitis. His respiratory status has improved after being NPO, suggesting chronic coughing on food. He requires ongoing respiratory support and is at risk for aspiration due to a depressed gag reflex. He has impaired transfers, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, delirium/confusion, pain control, impaired skin integrity, peripheral neuropathy, chronic renal failure, benign hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs are unstable with elevated blood pressure. He has ongoing fluid and electrolyte imbalances, fever, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is impaired, and he requires ongoing respiratory support. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to acute respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a depressed gag reflex, which increases the risk of aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia can develop if secretions are inhaled into the lungs.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delir"
