   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, though
   patient has chronic a.fib at baseline, and pneumonia as possible
   infectious source.  Other possible sources of infection in her include
   UTI (culture pending), abdominal process given recent surgery, and
   meningitis, though exam not consistent clinically with this condition.
   Will treat empirically for primary lung source but have low threshold
   for abdominal imaging given risk factors, elevated LFTs.  Was on
   bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - no central venous line for now but follow BP closely
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - low threshold for abdominal CT
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   - low-dose vitamin K to bring INR < 3 so PICC can be placed.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Appears tachypnic currently with
   suctioning of tan secretions from ETT in a.m. of [**2142-6-15**].  Follow-up
   CXR shows volume overload.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   though would consider other etiologies such as toxic ingestion and
   infection if enzymes do not trend down.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - holding warfarin for now in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but
   will need for stroke risk and MVR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR). The patient presents with altered mental status (AMS) and a question of sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 134/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has diminished breath sounds with rhonchi in the chest.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, an elevated hemoglobin level of 14.9 g/dL, and a decreased platelet count of 120,000/mm3. The blood glucose level is 121 mg/dL, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is elevated at 38 mg/dL. Other laboratory values show mild transaminitis with elevated AST and ALT levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues, including sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, transaminitis, and a history of recent surgery (laparotomy). The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. She presents with altered mental status (AMS) and possible sepsis. 

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. CHF (right sided): The patient has a history of CHF, which may be contributing to her current respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary HTN: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to increased workload on the heart and can exacerbate CHF symptoms.
3. Atrial fib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
4. Rheumatic heart disease: The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease, which has led to mechanical mitral valve replacement.
5. Mechanical MVR: The patient has a mechanical mitral valve replacement, requiring lifelong anticoagulation therapy.
6. HTN: The patient has hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient initially presented with symptoms of pneumonia and met the criteria for sepsis. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia.
3. Altered mental"

   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, though
   patient has chronic a.fib at baseline, and pneumonia as possible
   infectious source.  Other possible sources of infection in her include
   UTI (culture pending), abdominal process given recent surgery, and
   meningitis, though exam not consistent clinically with this condition.
   Will treat empirically for primary lung source but have low threshold
   for abdominal imaging given risk factors, elevated LFTs.  Was on
   bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - no central venous line for now but follow BP closely
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - low threshold for abdominal CT
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   - low-dose vitamin K to bring INR < 3 so PICC can be placed.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Appears tachypnic currently with
   suctioning of tan secretions from ETT in a.m. of [**2142-6-15**].  Follow-up
   CXR shows volume overload.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   though would consider other etiologies such as toxic ingestion and
   infection if enzymes do not trend down.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].

   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.

   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, mechanical mitral valve replacement, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She presents with altered mental status and possible sepsis. She has been admitted multiple times, most recently for small bowel obstruction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 131/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a tracheal mask. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Sepsis: The patient's presentation and admission meet SIRS criteria, indicating a possible infectious source, likely pneumonia. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia contributing to her current condition. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly secondary to an infectious process or toxic-metabolic causes. Other metabolic causes should also be considered. A head CT was negative, and a lumbar puncture has been deferred. Treatment of pneumonia has improved her mental status.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU since [date] and has experienced multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 131/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's physical examination shows alertness, clear oropharynx, supple neck, decreased breath sounds worse on the right side, irregular heart rhythm, and a midline scar in the lower abdomen.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, indicating acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but there is a possibility of hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. The patient presents with altered mental status and suspected sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, transaminitis, and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF, further deterioration of respiratory function leading to respiratory failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization, and potential bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants like warfarin for the mechanical mitral valve replacement. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels, as well as daily trends in laboratory results such as complete blood count (CBC), arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, and liver function tests (LFTs). Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status and respiratory status is crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L. Increased WOB today now back on NIV.
   - lasix gtt, goal TBB -1000 cc
   - Check ABG
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and suspected sepsis. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia. She has also been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone tracheostomy. The patient's mental status has improved with treatment of pneumonia. She is currently euvolemic and on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has elevated liver function tests, which are expected to trend down. She has a history of laparotomy without any active issues. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol. Her mechanical mitral valve replacement is being monitored with daily INR and Coumadin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient's respiratory symptoms, along with fever and tachycardia, suggest the possibility of pneumonia and sepsis. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of worsening infection or septic shock is necessary.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia and her underlying pulmonary conditions. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, as well as ongoing support with non-invasive ventilation, is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, mechanical mitral valve replacement, and severe tricuspid regurgitation.
- The patient presents with altered mental status and suspected sepsis, initially meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with fever and tachycardia.
- Chest CT suggests diffuse infiltrates, indicating pneumonia as the infectious source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to tracheostomy after failing extubation during a previous admission for small bowel obstruction.
- The patient was volume overloaded during hospitalization but has been diuresed with good effect, now appearing euvolemic. Pneumonia is contributing to respiratory failure.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to the infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased work of breathing. Other metabolic causes should also be considered.
- Head CT is negative, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and vitamin B12 levels are within normal limits. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is negative.
- Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are likely due to hypotension and shock liver, which are trending down since admission.
- The patient had a laparotomy but is stable without any"

The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics and anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is experiencing increased dyspnea. This indicates a potential worsening of their respiratory condition, which may require further intervention or adjustment in their ventilation support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in organ dysfunction or failure if not properly managed.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing AFib, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke and other heart-related complications. It is essential to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological complications"

   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L. Increased WOB today now back on NIV.
   - lasix gtt, goal TBB -1000 cc
   - Check ABG
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].

","Summary:
Mrs. [Last Name (STitle)] is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (right-sided), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and a mechanical mitral valve replacement. She presents with altered mental status and suspected sepsis. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Sepsis: The patient has diffuse infiltrates on chest CT and is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She initially met the SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, indicating a possible infectious source.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation during a previous admission for small bowel obstruction and subsequently underwent tracheostomy. She appears euvolemic but is experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB), which may contribute to her respiratory failure. She is currently back on non-invasive ventilation (NIV).

3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's baseline mental status is unclear, but she is alert and oriented. Her AMS could be secondary to an infectious process, toxic-metabolic causes, hypoxia/increased WOB, or other metabolic causes. A head CT was negative, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause of AMS.

   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >6L.  On mechanical ventilation as needed
   for resting.
   - lasix boluses prn
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - Daily INR, coumadin as above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary HTN), atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR). She presents with altered mental status (AMS) and a question of sepsis.

The patient has been on invasive ventilation for 24 hours, starting at 09:56 AM on 06/18/2142 and stopping at 04:00 PM on the same day. She was previously on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but switched back to spontaneous breathing mode for comfort overnight.

The patient's blood pressure is low, ranging from 92/46 mmHg to 110/70 mmHg. Her heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 76 to 109 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate is tachypneic, ranging from 14 to 30 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is good, consistently above 95%.

The patient has received multiple doses of vancomycin and ceftazidime for suspected sepsis. Her INR is subtherapeutic, and she has been started on heparin for mechanical valve prophylaxis. Lasix has been stopped due to hypotension.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creat"
