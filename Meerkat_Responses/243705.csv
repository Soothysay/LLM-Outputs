","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of HIV, recent CD4 count of 131, viral load below 48, cryptogenic cirrhosis, recurrent syncope, and multiple falls. He presented after a witnessed fall in the street and does not recall the event. In the emergency department, he was found to have atrial fibrillation, a heart rate of 70, blood pressure of 103/78, respiratory rate of 23, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 liters. He received medications for seizures, nausea, and an EKG showed dysrhythmia (sinus pauses). A FAST examination was negative, and CT imaging revealed right subdural hematoma, bilateral epidural hematomas, and bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages. The neurosurgeon determined no operative management was needed, but the patient did have a rib fracture on CTA. In the ICU, the patient's vital signs have been monitored, and he received intravenous fluids and blood products. He was unable to provide a history due to confusion. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fall. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except as noted above and below.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of HIV, recent CD4 count of 131, viral load below 48, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. He presented with recurrent syncope and multiple falls. In the emergency department, he experienced another fall and was found to have atrial fibrillation, hypertension, tachycardia, and a FAST negative result. CT imaging revealed right subdural hematoma, bilateral epidural hematomas, and bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages. Neurosurgery determined no operative intervention was needed, but a rib fracture was noted on computed tomography angiography. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 69-70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98-111/51-72 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood cultures were obtained at midnight. The patient is unable to provide a history due to confusion. No known drug allergies exist. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions in the ICU, including antibiotics. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the fall. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery. Physical examination findings include sinus rhythm on EKG, but peripheral pulses, skin, and neuro"

   63 year old man with HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hx of frequent syncope
   with an extensive workup and multiple falls presents after witnessed
   fall on street, found to have SDH, EDH on CT head.
   # Hypoxemia: O/N with respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on
   CXR, now more focused on left periphery. Unclear etiology. Diff
   includes pulmonary edema vs. aspiration vs TRALI from transfusion of
   platelets none of which seem likely, though responded well to diuresis
   and weaned down from nonrebreather to 4L NC, but now sats in low 90s.
   PCP is possible etiology though unlikely given rapid onset of symptoms
   and improvement with diuresis. Also on bactrim PPX. Lastly PE was
   considered, but no tachycardia on tele and CTA PE day prior was
   negative.  Now also concern for pneumo or bleeding from rib fracture on
   cxr.
   - chest CT to evaluate for right lung process
   - continue to monitor sats
   - lasix 20mg IV x 1
   - nitropaste prn
   - monitor I/O's
   - repeat CXR
   # Intracranial hemorrhage: No progression of bleed per imaging. Head CT
   now stable
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - Q shift  neuro checks
   - ADAT
   - Bedrest
   - Continue keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx
   # RUQ pain: concern for pumonary/rib pain vs galllbladder issue
   - RUQ ultrasound
   - chest CT
   - pain meds as needed
   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Given pt's
   pulmonary hypertension on old ECHO, there is some concern for syncope
   secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Echo from [**3-29**] showed no evidence
   of valvular disease to provoke syncope.
   - repeat ECHO
   - Tele- no events
   - ROMI- negative
   - Hold nadolol as bradycardic
   # Lactic acidosis: improved
   # Temporal bone Fracture: evaluate CT head
   - discuss with either ophtho vs plastics
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 up from baseline 0.9. Suspect prerena. Now improved to
   1.
   # HIV:
   - Contine HAART
   - Continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck HIV labs
   # Psych meds:
   - hold psych meds to pervent sedation
   # CV risk: Hold all PO meds tonight. No ST changes on EKG, no CP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and frequent syncope. He presented after a witnessed fall and was found to have subdural hematoma (SDH) and epidural hematoma (EDH) on CT head. The patient's recent events include worsening respiratory distress and back pain at midnight, with an EKG showing no changes. He was advanced to nonrebreather-sats 96% and had bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, leading to concerns of pulmonary edema, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and syncope. The patient's hypoxemia was initially treated with diuretics and oxygen supplementation. Further imaging, including a chest CT and repeat CXR, was ordered to evaluate for right lung process and pneumothorax. The patient's intracranial hemorrhage appears stable without progression on imaging. He is being monitored closely for any changes in neurological status and will continue with bedrest and neuro checks. The patient also experienced RUQ pain, which may be related to gallbladder issues or rib fractures seen on CXR. An RUQ ultrasound and chest CT will be performed to investigate further. The patient's syncope remains under investigation, with possible causes including symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis, and mechanical fall. Repeat ECHO and tele events will be monitored, and ROMI is negative. The patient's lactic"

   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Given pt's
   pulmonary hypertension on old ECHO, there is some concern for syncope
   secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Echo from [**3-29**] showed no evidence

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and frequent syncope. He was admitted after a witnessed fall and found to have subdural hematoma (SDH) and epidural hematoma (EDH) on the CT head. The patient presented with hypoxemia overnight with respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on CXR. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear, with possibilities including pulmonary edema, aspiration, or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). However, the patient responded well to diuresis and was weaned down from nonrebreather to 4L NC.

The patient also has an intracranial hemorrhage, but there has been no progression of the bleed per imaging. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is now stable.

The patient's syncope differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis, and mechanical fall. It is difficult to separate these as the patient currently does not remember the fall and states that he was at home.

The patient has lactic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and HIV. His lactic acidosis has improved, and his ARF has resolved.

The patient's chronic right hip pain has been restarted with pain medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Monitoring oxygen saturation (sats), continuing diuretic therapy, and repeating chest X-ray are planned.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient has an intracranial hemorrhage, but no progression of the bleed per imaging. Frequent neuro checks, bedrest, and continuation of antiepileptic drug therapy are planned.
3. Syncope: The patient's syncope differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis, and mechanical fall. Further evaluation, including repeat echocardiogram, is planned to determine the underlying cause.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5, which has now improved to 1.0. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. HIV: The patient's HIV infection requires ongoing management with HAART therapy.
6. Chronic Right Hip Pain: The patient's chronic right hip pain has been restarted with pain medications. Ongoing pain management is essential.
7. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis has improved, but ongoing monitoring is necessary."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with AIDS, on HAART, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patient experienced frequent syncopal episodes, which were associated with falls, leading to subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural and intraparenchymal bleeds, and a temporal fracture.

The patient had several significant events in the past 24 hours. At midnight, the patient presented with hypoxemia, diaphoresis, holding chest, writhing, and lower back pain on the right side. The patient was temporarily placed on non-rebreather mask (NRB) with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 94%. A repeat chest X-ray showed worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. The patient was then given lasix 40 IV and nitropaste for back pain, followed by morphine for pain relief. The patient's urine output (UOP) improved, and they felt better, although it was unclear if this improvement was related to diuresis or morphine.

The patient is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC) oxygen and has fluctuating O2 sat. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), current temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 55 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 124/68 mmHg to 148/102 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.3-6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.5-33.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 141-151 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01, glucose level of 123 mg/dL, and various other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/troponin-T, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Mg++/PO43-), and more.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and pulmonary edema. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear, and the possibility of aspiration is being considered. The patient has also shown improvement with lasix. Further investigations such as repeat diuresis, non-contrast chest CT, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are planned.

The patient's rising liver enzymes and bilirubin levels indicate potential liver dysfunction, which may be related to their known history of cryptogenic cirrh"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with AIDS, on HAART, and cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with frequent syncopal episodes. The patient has experienced multiple falls, leading to a subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural and intraparenchymal bleeds, and a temporal fracture. The patient's medical history includes respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and rising liver function tests (LFTs) with bilirubin elevation. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia and mild hypoxemia. On physical examination, the patient has ecchymosis in the right eye, mild crackles in the lungs, RUQ tenderness, and neurological findings such as tremor, past pointing, downgoing toes bilaterally, and good motor function. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently on various medications including morphine sulfate, furosemide (Lasix), and Keppra.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are fluctuating, indicating potential complications related to respiratory function.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress and further complications.
3. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has experienced multiple bleeds"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with AIDS, on HAART therapy, and has cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patient experienced several syncopal episodes, leading to falls and subsequent head trauma, resulting in subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural bleed, and an intraparenchymal bleed. The patient also has a temporal fracture.

The patient's recent events include hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and pulmonary edema. The patient required supplemental oxygen and had worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may indicate possible pulmonary edema. The patient received lasix, nitropaste, and morphine for back pain, which improved his symptoms. Currently, the patient is on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen with fluctuating oxygen saturation levels.

The patient has a history of syncope, known orthostatic hypotension, and negative cardiac enzymes. He is currently on telemetry monitoring and will undergo carotid studies and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during this admission. The patient is also holding nadolol due to bradycardia.

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 SYNCOPE
   63 year old man with HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hx of frequent syncope
   with an extensive workup and multiple falls presents after witnessed
   fall on street, found to have SDH, EDH on CT head.
   # Hypoxemia: 2 nights ago pt had respiratory distress and bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR, now more focused on left periphery. Unclear
   etiology. Differential includes pulm edema (responded to lasix
   yesterday) versus splinting from rib fx vs lung contusion. O2
   requirment now stable. Afebrile
   - f/u chest CT
   - continue to monitor sats
   - lasix prn
   - monitor I/O's
   - f/u ECHO
   # Intracranial hemorrhage: No progression of bleed per imaging. Head CT
   now stable
   - f/u with neuro as outpatient in 8weeks
   - ok to get OOB w/ assistance
   - Continue keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx
   # RUQ pain: concern for pumonary/rib pain vs galllbladder issue
   - RUQ ultrasound normal
   - chest CT- lung contusion
   - pain meds as needed
   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Given pt's
   pulmonary hypertension on old ECHO, there is some concern for syncope
   secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Echo from [**3-29**] showed no evidence
   of valvular disease to provoke syncope.
   - repeat ECHO
   - Tele- no events
   - ROMI- negative
   - Hold nadolol as continues to be brady
   # Hyponatremia: Differential: hypovol hyponatremia versus SIADH
   secondary to ICH versus pulm etiol.  Na 130.
   Urine osm: 751
   Serum osm: 272
   - Add on urine sodium
   - Fluid restrict for now
   - Recheck Na at 1pm
   # Lactic acidosis: improved
   # Temporal bone Fracture: evaluate CT head
   - discuss with either ophtho vs plastics
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 on admission, now at baseline 0.8. Likely prerenal as
   resolved with IVFs.
   # HIV:
   - Contine HAART
   - Continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck HIV labs
   # Psych meds:
   - hold psych meds to prevent sedation
   # CV risk: No ST changes on EKG, no CP.
   - Hold ASA given bleed
   - Restart lipitor
   - Hold nadolol if remains bradycardic
   # Chronic R hip pain: continue pain meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and frequent syncope. He presented after a witnessed fall and was found to have subdural hematoma (SDH) and epidural hematoma (EDH) on CT head. The patient has been in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could indicate pulmonary edema. This may be due to fluid overload or cardiac issues.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of SDH and EDH, indicating a risk of further intracranial bleeding. Monitoring and follow-up with neurology are important.
3. Syncope: The patient has a history of syncope with an extensive workup. The cause of syncope remains unclear, but it could be due to bradycardia, orthostasis, mechanical fall, or pulmonary hypertension.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130. The differential includes hypovolemic hyponatremia versus SIADH secondary to ICH or pulmonary etiology. Further evaluation and fluid restriction are necessary.
5. Temporal Bone Fracture: The patient may have a temporal bone fracture, which should be evaluated by ophthalmology"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 SYNCOPE
   63 year old man with HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hx of frequent syncope
   with an extensive workup and multiple falls presents after witnessed
   fall on street, found to have SDH, EDH on CT head.
   # Hypoxemia: 2 nights ago pt had respiratory distress and bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR, now more focused on left periphery. Unclear
   etiology. Differential includes pulm edema (responded to lasix
   yesterday) versus splinting from rib fx. O2 requirment now stable.
   - chest CT showed ? conslidations v pulm edema
   - continue to monitor sats
   - nitropaste prn, lasix prn
   - monitor I/O's
   - repeat CXR
   # Intracranial hemorrhage: No progression of bleed per imaging. Head CT
   now stable
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - Q shift  neuro checks
   - ADAT
   - Bedrest
   - Continue keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx
   # RUQ pain: concern for pumonary/rib pain vs galllbladder issue
   - RUQ ultrasound
   - chest CT
   - pain meds as needed
   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Given pt's
   pulmonary hypertension on old ECHO, there is some concern for syncope
   secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Echo from [**3-29**] showed no evidence
   of valvular disease to provoke syncope.
   - repeat ECHO
   - Tele- no events
   - ROMI- negative
   - Hold nadolol as bradycardic o/n
   # Hyponatremia: Differential: hypovol hyponatremia versus SIADH
   secondary to ICH versus pulm etiol.
   Urine osm: 751
   Serum osm: 272
   - Add on urine sodium
   - Fluid restrict for now
   - Recheck Na at 1pm
   # Lactic acidosis: improved
   # Temporal bone Fracture: evaluate CT head
   - discuss with either ophtho vs plastics
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 on admission, now at baseline 0.8. Likely prerenal as
   resolved with IVFs.
   # HIV:
   - Contine HAART
   - Continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck HIV labs
   # Psych meds:
   - hold psych meds to prevent sedation
   # CV risk: Hold all PO meds tonight. No ST changes on EKG, no CP.
   - Hold ASA given bleed
   - Restart lipitor
   - Hold nadolol if remains bradycardic
   # Chronic R hip pain: Restarted pain meds
   FEN: IVF, clears

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a total input of 1,965 mL and output of 4,650 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,685 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of 23. Physical examination findings include undetermined peripheral pulses, unassessed skin, and untested neurologic responses. Laboratory results show abnormal levels in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, glucose, and other parameters. Imaging reveals a right-sided rib fracture with associated extrapleural hematoma and opacification of bilateral lower lobes, suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's bilateral R>L infiltrates may lead to persistent hypoxia. Pulmonary edema, aspiration, or atelectasis from splinting due to rib"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is trauma of unclear mechanism. The patient has a history of HIV and is currently on home regimen. The patient also has a history of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus issues. There are concerns about hypoxia due to bilateral infiltrates, pulmonary edema, aspiration, atelectasis, and a small-moderate right pleural effusion. The patient also has an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with subdural hematoma (SDH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IPH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Syncope is suspected to be related to orthostatic hypotension and sinus bradycardia. There are also concerns about hypovolemia versus syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are being considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The presence of bilateral infiltrates, pulmonary edema, aspiration, atelectasis, and pleural effusion increases the risk of hypoxia.
2. Intracerebral Hemorrhage"

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 SYNCOPE
   63 year old man with HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hx of frequent syncope
   with an extensive workup and multiple falls presents after witnessed
   fall on street, found to have SDH, EDH on CT head.
   # Hypoxemia: 2 nights ago pt had respiratory distress and bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR, now more focused on left periphery. Unclear
   etiology. Differential includes pulm edema (responded to lasix
   yesterday) versus splinting from rib fx vs lung contusion. O2
   requirment now stable. Afebrile. Chest CT with likely contusion
   adjacent to rib fracture in right lower lung. No significant change on
   echo from [**3-29**] (no CHF).
   - continue to monitor sats
   - lasix prn
   - monitor I/O's
   # Intracranial hemorrhage: No progression of bleed per imaging. Head CT
   now stable
   - f/u with neuro as outpatient in 8weeks
   - ok to get OOB w/ assistance
   - Continue keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx
   # RUQ pain: concern for pulmonary/rib pain. RUQ ultrasound without
   acute liver or gallbladder pathology
   - chest CT- lung contusion
   - pain meds as needed
   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Given pt's
   pulmonary hypertension on old ECHO, there is some concern for syncope
   secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Echo from [**3-29**] showed no evidence
   of valvular disease to provoke syncope. Echo now shows no change, only
   borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   - Tele- no events
   - ROMI- negative
   - Hold nadolol as continues to be brady
   # Hyponatremia: Differential: hypovolemic hyponatremia versus SIADH
   secondary to ICH versus pulmonary etiology.  Na now corrected from 130
   to 134. Urine osm: 751, Serum osm: 272, Urine Na of 71. These labs are
   more consitent with SIADH.
   - Continue fluid restriction of 2 liters
   - monitor Na
   # Lactic acidosis: improved
   # Temporal bone Fracture: On facial CT scan, pt has hairline fracture
   of zygomatic bone, no surgery needed per plastics
   - pain medication as needed
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 on admission, now resolved. Likely prerenal as
   resolved with IVFs.
   # HIV:
   - Contine HAART
   - Continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck HIV labs
   # Psych meds:
   - hold psych meds to prevent sedation
   # CV risk: No ST changes on EKG, no CP.
   - Hold ASA given bleed
   - Restart lipitor
   - Hold nadolol if remains bradycardic
   # Chronic R hip pain:
   - continue pain meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a history of frequent syncope. He was admitted after a witnessed fall resulting in a subdural hematoma (SDH) and an epidural hematoma (EDH) on CT head. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient had respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which were initially thought to be due to pulmonary edema. However, the cause is now more focused on the left periphery. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, rib fracture-related splinting, and lung contusion. The patient's oxygen requirement is currently stable, and there is no significant change on echo from the last assessment (no congestive heart failure).

2. Intracranial hemorrhage: There has been no progression of the bleed per imaging, and the head CT is now stable. The plan is to follow up with neurology as an outpatient in 8 weeks, allow the patient to go out of bed with assistance, and continue taking keppra 500 mg for seizure prophylaxis.

3. RUQ pain: The concern is for pulmonary or rib pain. A chest CT showed a lung contusion, and pain medication is being given as needed. No acute liver or gallbladder pathology was found on RUQ ultrasound."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 SYNCOPE
   63 year old man with HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hx of frequent syncope
   with an extensive workup and multiple falls presents after witnessed
   fall on street, found to have SDH, EDH on CT head.
   # Hypoxemia: Improved. Afebrile. Chest CT with likely contusion
   adjacent to rib fracture in right lower lung. No significant change on
   echo from [**3-29**] (no CHF). Still autodiuresing.
   - continue to monitor sats
   - lasix prn
   - monitor I/O's
   - continue incentive spirometry
   # Intracranial hemorrhage: No progression of bleed per imaging. Head CT
   now stable
   - f/u with neuro as outpatient in 8weeks
   - ok to get OOB w/ assistance
   - Continue keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for sz ppx
   # Rib fractures: Continue pain meds.
   - incentive spirometry
   # Syncope: Differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis,
   mechanical fall. Difficult to separate these as pt currently does not
   remember fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope
   revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well
   as concern by neurology that pt has peripheral neuropathy as well as
   mechanical risk for syncope due to pain from right hip. Echo now shows
   no change, only borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   - Tele- no events
   - ROMI- negative
   - Hold nadolol as continues to be brady
   - Consider outpatient event monitor to evaluate for arrythmia as cause
   of syncope
   - Check orthostatic BPs
   # Hyponatremia: Differential: hypovolemic hyponatremia versus SIADH
   secondary to ICH versus pulmonary etiology.  Na now corrected from 130
   to 134. Urine osm: 751, Serum osm: 272, Urine Na of 71. These labs are
   more consitent with SIADH.
   - d/c fluid restriction as sodium improved
   - trend Na
   # Temporal bone Fracture: On facial CT scan, pt has hairline fracture
   of zygomatic bone, no surgery needed per plastics
   - pain medication as needed
   # HIV:
   - Contine HAART
   - Continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck HIV labs (unchanged from [**6-29**])
   # Psych meds:
   - Restarted nortriptyline overnight
   - Restarted ativen for sleep overnight, probably should not be on
   benzos given recurrent falls.
   - d/c lorazepam
   # CV risk: No ST changes on EKG, no CP.
   - Hold ASA given bleed
   - Restart lipitor
   - Hold nadolol if remains bradycardic
   # Chronic R hip pain:
   - continue pain meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of HIV, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and frequent syncope. He presented to the hospital after a witnessed fall and was found to have a subdural hematoma (SDH) and an epidural hematoma (EDH) on CT head. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, which has improved, and a chest CT showing a likely contusion adjacent to a rib fracture in the right lower lung. There is no significant change on the echo from previous findings, indicating no congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is autodiuresing.

The patient also has an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), but there has been no progression of the bleed per imaging, and the head CT is now stable. The plan is to follow up with neurology as an outpatient in 8 weeks, okay to get out of bed with assistance, and continue taking keppra 500 mg for seizure prophylaxis.

Additionally, the patient has rib fractures, and the plan is to continue pain medication and incentive spirometry.

Regarding syncope, the differential includes symptomatic bradycardia, orthostasis, and mechanical fall. The patient currently does not remember the fall and states that he was at home. Prior workups for syncope revealed abnormal tilt table testing (notable for orthostasis) as well as concern by neurology that the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA/pulmonary contusion:
   autodiuresing, off O2, however still with atelectasis on pulonary
   exam.. encourage incentive spirometer use, cough and deep breathing. no
   signs of infection.
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH):
   Stable neuroexam.
 SYNCOPE:
   appreciate PCP's input.. bblocker on hold due to bradycardia, will
   likely be discharged with event monitor, will stop ativan, measure
   orthostatics for history of orthostatic hypotension. Consult PT.
Hyponatremia:
   resolved
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Comments: regular diet, stop fluid restriction

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of syncope and polytrauma. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been restarted on heparin subcutaneously. A maxillofacial CT scan revealed a hairline fracture of the zygomatic bone on the right side. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is receiving various medications including colace, celexa, bactrim, pantoprazole, HAART, keppra, ativan, and nortriptyline.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/82 mmHg to 90/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, syncope, and hyponatremia. The assessment and plan include management of pulmonary edema/pulmonary contusion, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), syncope, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema/pulmonary contusion: The patient has diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory distress and further complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure if not properly managed"
