   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary
   HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  The patient states that her dyspnea has increased over the
   past two weeks, in the setting of a recent URI.  Given her history of
   reactive airway disease, PEs, and pulmonary hypertension, the
   differential of her acute presentation remains broad: COPD exacerbation
   v. recurrent PE v. Pneumonia v. CAD.  Furthermore, her CXR demonstrated
   fluid overload, and she has noticed peripheral edema in the setting of
   not using Lasix, so CHF exacerbation may be contributing to her current
   SOB. Most likely, patient has underlying Pickwickian syndrome, with
   component of hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention.
    - Give Lasix 20 mg IV X1-2 today with goal -2L; recheck PM lytes
    - Continue nebulizations prn and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt with bridge to coumadin, given patient's h/o PE
   and subtherapeutic INR
 will restart Coumadin today
    - If respiratory status doesn't improve, continue prednisone +
   Levoquin for presumed COPD exacerbation
   - Repeat ECHO today
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap and sleep study as outpatient
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Her INR is currently subtherapeutic at 1.5.
    - Continue home dose of Warfarin 10 mg daily with heparin bridge
    - Continue to monitor INR daily
    - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over the past three days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/62 to 157/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. She is currently on BiPap support and receiving heparin sodium infusion. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, troponin T level, blood glucose, and electrolyte levels, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her chest X-ray reveals fluid overload, and she has noticed peripheral edema. The patient's condition is being managed with Lasix, nebulizations, Advair for COPD, and anticoagulation therapy. Further plans include restarting Coumadin, repeating an echocardiogram, and considering chronic BiPap and sleep study as an outpatient. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's history of COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to exacerbated dyspnea and hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, obesity, and impaired skin integrity. He was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of dyspnea. The patient is currently receiving BiPAP support, as well as lasix and heparin infusions. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing episodes of desaturation. The patient's weight has decreased from 234 kg at admission to 217 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 72 mL and total output of 4,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,928 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume (VT) of 900 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O. ABG results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 165, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 71. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 173 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose level of 155 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is below 0.01, and troponin-I level is within normal range. Other labs are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and acute exacerbation of dyspnea puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and adjusting BiPAP settings may be necessary to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pneumonia, especially considering his prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Frequent assessment of respiratory symptoms and cultures may be needed to prevent and detect any potential infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and heparin infusion should be continued to reduce the risk of thrombus formation.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary
   HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  The patient states that her dyspnea has increased over the
   past two weeks, in the setting of a recent URI.  Given her history of
   reactive airway disease, PEs, and pulmonary hypertension, the
   differential of her acute presentation remains broad: COPD exacerbation
   v. recurrent PE v. Pneumonia v. CAD.  Furthermore, her CXR demonstrated
   fluid overload, and she has noticed peripheral edema in the setting of
   not using Lasix, so CHF exacerbation may be contributing to her current
   SOB. Most likely, patient has underlying Pickwickian syndrome, with
   component of hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention.
    - Give Lasix 20 mg IV X1-2 today with goal -2L; recheck PM lytes
    - Continue nebulizations prn and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt with bridge to coumadin, given patient's h/o PE
   and subtherapeutic INR
 will restart Coumadin today
    - If respiratory status doesn't improve, continue prednisone +
   Levoquin for presumed COPD exacerbation
   - Repeat ECHO today
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Her INR is currently subtherapeutic at 1.5.
    - Continue home dose of Warfarin 10 mg daily with heparin bridge
    - Continue to monitor INR daily
    - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 120/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on BiPap. The patient is well-nourished and overweight. Physical examination findings include trace edema in both lower extremities and clear breath sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels, as well as slightly elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic at 1.5.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD, recent URI, and worsening dyspnea suggest the possibility of a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to increased shortness of breath, coughing, and production of sputum.
2. Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's history of PE and pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of recurrent PE. Symptoms may include sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
3. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia raises concern for pneumonia. Symptoms may include productive cough with purulent sputum, fever, and leukocytosis.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Exacerbation: The patient's fluid overload on CXR and peripheral edema suggest the possibility of CHF exacerbation. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's acute presentation could also be due to CAD, which may manifest as chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, and abnormal ECG findings.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, administer appropriate medications for COPD exacerbation and anticoagulation therapy, manage fluid balance, and assess for any signs of complications such as DVT or infection. Regular evaluation of the patient's INR and PTT levels is necessary to ensure appropriate anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary
   HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  The patient states that her dyspnea has increased over the
   past two weeks, in the setting of a recent URI.  Given her history of
   reactive airway disease, PEs, and pulmonary hypertension, the
   differential of her acute presentation remains broad: COPD exacerbation
   v. recurrent PE v. Pneumonia v. CAD.  Furthermore, her CXR demonstrated
   fluid overload, and she has noticed peripheral edema in the setting of
   not using Lasix, so CHF exacerbation may be contributing to her current
   SOB. Most likely, patient has underlying Pickwickian syndrome, with
   component of hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention.
    - Give Lasix 20 mg IV X1-2 today with goal -2L; recheck PM lytes
    - Continue nebulizations prn and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt with bridge to coumadin, given patient's h/o PE
   and subtherapeutic INR
 will restart Coumadin today
    - If respiratory status doesn't improve, continue prednisone +
   Levoquin for presumed COPD exacerbation
   - Repeat ECHO today
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap and sleep study as outpatient
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Her INR is currently subtherapeutic at 1.5.
    - Continue home dose of Warfarin 10 mg daily with heparin bridge
    - Continue to monitor INR daily
    - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over the past two weeks. Her recent URI, fluid overload, peripheral edema, and hypoxia suggest possible causes such as COPD exacerbation, recurrent pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure. The patient has been prescribed Lasix to reduce fluid retention, nebulizations for COPD management, and heparin therapy to prevent further blood clots. An ECHO will be repeated today, and the patient may require chronic BiPAP and a sleep study as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxia indicate potential respiratory complications. This could include exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of recent PE and subtherapeutic INR suggest a risk of recurrent PE. Monitoring INR levels and continuing heparin therapy are important to prevent further blood clots.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's fluid overload, peripheral edema, and hypoxia may be indicative of an exacerbation of CHF. Management with diuretics like Lasix and monitoring for electrolyte abnormalities are crucial.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving diuretics, bipap intermittently, and is currently on heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9 C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/78 to 157/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight is 217 kg, indicating obesity. Fluid balance shows an intake of 72 mL and output of 4,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,928 mL. The patient is on bipap support and is receiving oxygen through CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 45%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 78, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 127. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, and diminished breath sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal glucose levels. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and requires nocturnal bipap support. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and is anticoagulated."

Her INR is increasing towards therapeutic levels due to heparin and warfarin therapy. The patient's WBC count is slightly low, but other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxia suggest respiratory complications such as exacerbation of COPD, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is crucial.

2. Infection: The presence of fungal and Legionella bacteria in the sputum culture indicates a possible infection. The patient may be at risk for pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the culture results.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of right atrial dilatation, pulmonary hypertension, and the possibility of congestive heart failure suggest potential cardiac complications. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered to evaluate for congestive heart failure.

   The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary
   HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  The patient states that her dyspnea has increased over the
   past two weeks, in the setting of a recent URI.  Given her history of
   reactive airway disease, PEs, and pulmonary hypertension, the
   differential of her acute presentation remains broad: COPD exacerbation
   v. recurrent PE v. Pneumonia v. CAD.  Furthermore, her CXR demonstrated
   fluid overload, and she has noticed peripheral edema in the setting of
   not using Lasix, so CHF exacerbation may be contributing to her current
   SOB. Most likely, patient has underlying Pickwickian syndrome, with
   component of hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention.
    - Give Lasix 20 mg IV X1-2 today with goal -2L; recheck PM lytes
    - Continue nebulizations prn and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt with bridge to coumadin, given patient's h/o PE
   and subtherapeutic INR
 will restart Coumadin today
    - If respiratory status doesn't improve, continue prednisone +
   Levoquin for presumed COPD exacerbation
   - Repeat ECHO today
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap and sleep study as outpatient
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Her INR is currently subtherapeutic at 1.5.
    - Continue home dose of Warfarin 10 mg daily with heparin bridge
    - Continue to monitor INR daily
    - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over the past two weeks. The differential diagnosis for her acute presentation includes COPD exacerbation, recurrent PE, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's chest X-ray showed fluid overload, and she also experienced peripheral edema due to not using Lasix. Therefore, CHF exacerbation may be contributing to her current shortness of breath. The patient is likely suffering from Pickwickian syndrome, which involves a component of hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention.

The plan of care includes administering Lasix 20 mg IV X1-2 today with the goal of removing 2 liters of fluid, rechecking potassium levels, continuing nebulizations as needed, and using Advair for COPD. Heparin therapy will be continued with a bridge to Coumadin, considering the patient's history of PE and subtherapeutic INR. Coumadin will be restarted today.

If the respiratory status does not improve, the patient may require prednisone and Levoquin for presumed COPD exacerbation. An echocardiogram will be repeated today, and the patient may need chronic Bipap and a sleep study as an outpatient.

   Imaging: [**2-20**] CXR: Radiograph is limited due to large body habitus. The
   cardiac silhouette is
   stably enlarged, unchanged compared to multiple prior examinations. The
   left
   lateral hemithorax is not visualized on this examination. There is
   stable,
   diffuse patchy opacity at the right lung with prominent pulmonary
   vasculature,
   consistent with congestive heart failure, unchanged. No evidence of

   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent
   PE, and pulmonary HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening
   dyspnea and hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Subjectively improved with decreased oxygen requirements.
   Excellent response to diuresis yesterday (net -6.7 liters) to 20 mg IV
   lasix, so may have CHF component to current presentation. Also has
   known CAD, COPD, PE
s, pulm htn, likely obesity hypoventilation
   syndrome, and recent URI. Baseline home O2 is 5 liters NC. INR
   increasing towards therapeutic.
    - Another dose of Lasix 20 mg IV this morning, with goal diuresis -1
   to -2 liters today
   -  [**Hospital1 **] lytes
    - Continue nebs and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt and warfarin; INR now therapeutic; will need
   three days to bridge.
   - If significantly improves with further diuresis, and stable WBC (in
   setting of steroids) consider d/c steroids/ABx today
   - TTE to evaluate for CHF
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap and sleep study as outpatient
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Unable to obtain CTA given habitus; heparin gtt started
   empirically, and to bridge back to therapeutic INR
   - c/w heparin gtt for now (three more days)
   - c/w warfarin 10 mg daily
   - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.
   # H/o COPD: Treatment as above
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt
   # Glycemic control: Hyperglycemic while on steroids; will start insulin

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has been treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an increased temperature and decreased oxygen saturation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. Imaging reveals evidence of CHF and diffuse patchy opacity in the right lung. The patient's current medications include heparin, warfarin, Lasix, Advair, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization leading to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Worsening respiratory distress due to acute exacerbation of COPD.
3. Cardiac complications such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or arrhythmias.
4. Infection due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia from insulin therapy.
6. Bleeding complications from anticoagulation therapy.
7. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances from diuretic use.
8. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
9. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.

   Imaging: [**2-20**] CXR: Radiograph is limited due to large body habitus. The
   cardiac silhouette is
   stably enlarged, unchanged compared to multiple prior examinations. The
   left
   lateral hemithorax is not visualized on this examination. There is
   stable,
   diffuse patchy opacity at the right lung with prominent pulmonary
   vasculature,
   consistent with congestive heart failure, unchanged. No evidence of
   pneumothorax.

   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent
   PE, and pulmonary HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening
   dyspnea and hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Subjectively improved with decreased oxygen requirements.
   Excellent response to diuresis yesterday (net -6.7 liters) to 20 mg IV
   lasix, so may have CHF component to current presentation. Also has
   known CAD, COPD, PE
s, pulm htn, likely obesity hypoventilation
   syndrome, and recent URI. Baseline home O2 is 5 liters NC. INR now
   therapeutic.
    - Another dose of Lasix 20 mg IV this morning, with goal diuresis -1
   to -2 liters today (at least)
   -  [**Hospital1 **] lytes
    - Continue nebs and Advair for COPD
    - Continue heparin gtt and warfarin; INR now therapeutic; will need
   three days of therapeutic levels to bridge.
   - If significantly improves with further diuresis, and stable WBC (in
   setting of steroids) consider d/c steroids/ABx after tomorrow (5 day
   pulse course)
   - Will switch to PO steroids today
   - TTE to evaluate for CHF
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap, sleep study as outpatient
   social work to see patient re: mobility, equipment for home etc
   .
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Unable to obtain CTA given habitus; heparin gtt started
   empirically, and to bridge back to therapeutic INR
   - c/w heparin gtt for now (three more days)
   - c/w warfarin 10 mg daily
   - Check PTT q6h for heparin goal 60-100.
   # H/o COPD: Treatment as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient continues to experience dyspnea but subjectively improves. The dyspnea may be related to congestive heart failure (CHF), as she diureses well with relatively small doses of IV lasix.
2. Acute diastolic CHF: The patient's TTE showed an ejection fraction (EF) > 55%, indicating preserved left ventricular systolic function. However, she has evidence of acute diastolic dysfunction. She is responding well to lasix diuresis.
3. History of PEs: The patient has a history of presumed PEs and is on long-term anticoagulation therapy. Her INR is currently supratherapeutic due to the recent administration of levofloxacin, which may interact with warfarin. Warfarin therapy will be restarted at"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over the past three days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 to 132/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on CPAP. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly decreased hematocrit. Her creatinine levels are within normal range, and electrolyte levels are also within normal limits. Other lab results including glucose, TCO2, CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, and differential are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute-on-chronic COPD exacerbation, obesity, impaired skin integrity, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF) component. She is currently receiving diuretics (Lasix), bronchodilators, and anticoagulation therapy. The plan includes continuing nebs and Advair for COPD, switching to oral steroids, and performing a trans-thoracic echo to evaluate for CHF. The patient will also require chronic biPAP and a sleep study as an outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, dyspnea, obesity, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving BiPAP support at night and supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula during the day. The patient had a dermal biopsy done on the inner left thigh nodules yesterday and his INR was elevated at 3.4, so he was taken off heparin and Coumadin. He is also on furosemide (Lasix) and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned above. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 108/73 mmHg to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 212.5 kg, with a total fluid balance of -2677 mL since 25 AM and a urine output of 3390 mL. 

Physical examination findings include an overweight/obese general appearance, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no skin assessment performed. Neurologic assessment shows the patient follows simple commands and responds"

   The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary
   HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Continues to subjectively improve. Continues to diurese
   exceedingly well to relatively small doses of IV lasix, so may have CHF
   component to current presentation. Also has known CAD, COPD, PE
s, pulm
   htn, likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and recent URI. Baseline
   home O2 is 5 liters NC. INR supratherapeutic yesterday and today.
   - Another dose of Lasix 20 mg IV this morning, with goal diuresis -1 to
   -2 liters today (at least); can repeat dose if needed
   - Disacontinued levaquin and steroids given no fevers, leukocytosis,
   completed abbreviated course for presumed COPD exacerbation
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Continue nebs and Advair for COPD
   - Patient likely needs chronic Bipap, sleep study as outpatient
   social work to see patient re: mobility, equipment for home etc
   - Case Management working on pulm rehab at Radius
   # Acute diastolic CHF: S/p TTE with EF > 55% yesterday. Responding well
   to lasix.
   - Outpatient cards follow up
   - Encourage adherence with lasix for after discharge
   #. History of PEs:  The patient has a history of presumed PEs in
   [**Month (only) 1918**], for which she is to be on anticoagulation for at least 6
   months.  Unable to obtain CTA given habitus. INR supratherapeutic.
   D/c
ing levofloxacin as above.
   - hold today
s dose of warfarin given supratherapeutic INR, which may
   be [**2-9**] interaction with levofloxacin.
   - Starting tomorrow, may resume home dose of Warfarin
   # Thigh nodule: Not fluctuant, does not appear to be abscess. Chronic
   and intermittently more tender with weight gain.
   - Derm biopsied nodule
 will follow up on recs and biopsy pathology
   # H/o COPD: Current presentation appears to be predominantly [**2-9**] volume
   overload. Steroids may be causing fluid retention.
   - Will d/c steroids
   - Will d/c Abx, as above
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: warfarin
   # Glycemic control: insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over the past three days. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has been on BiPAP at night and noninvasive CPAP during the day. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed an ejection fraction >55%, and a dermal biopsy of inner thigh nodules. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and magnesium, but normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia could be indicative of acute diastolic heart failure, which is suggested by her history of COPD and recent PE. The use of diuretics like Lasix has been initiated to manage fluid overload.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient's current medications include bipap at night, 5L NC during the day, furosemide, and antibiotics which have been discontinued. Her INR was elevated yesterday and today, so she is off heparin and coumadin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/73 to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 234 kg at admission to 212.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2677 mL. The patient has been receiving respiratory support with O2 delivery device and bipap. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF (congestive heart failure) due to worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, known CAD (coronary artery disease), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), PE (pulmonary embolism), pulmonary hypertension, and likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Right heart failure secondary to LV (left ventricular) compromise from RV (right ventricular) dilation in the setting of known pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia over a 3-day period. The patient has been diagnosed with right heart failure, likely secondary to LV compromise from RV dilation in the setting of known pulmonary hypertension. Her INR is supratherapeutic, indicating a need to restart warfarin. The patient also has a history of presumed PEs in 1918 and will require long-term anticoagulation. A thigh nodule was biopsied due to chronic tenderness and intermittent pain associated with weight gain. The patient's current presentation appears to be predominantly volume overload, which may be exacerbated by steroid use for COPD. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD, recent PE, and pulmonary hypertension, there is a high risk of respiratory complications such as exacerbations of COPD, further episodes of PE, and worsening pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is crucial.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has right heart failure with evidence of LV compromise from RV dilation. This increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbations, and potentially poor outcomes if not managed appropriately.

3. Thromboembolic Complications: As the patient has a history of PEs and is on anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of thromboembolic events. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and adherence to anticoagulation therapy is essential to prevent further PEs.

4. Infection: The patient has a thigh nodule that was biopsied. Although it does not appear to be an abscess, there is still a risk of infection, particularly if the biopsy site becomes infected. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

5. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's presentation seems to be predominantly volume overload. Careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes is essential to prevent further complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

6. Medication Side Effects: The patient is on multiple medications including steroids for COPD. Steroid use can lead to fluid retention and exacerbate volume overload. Regular monitoring for medication side effects is necessary.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring and management of respiratory, cardiac, thromboembolic, infectious, fluid and electrolyte, and medication-related complications are crucial to ensure optimal outcomes."
