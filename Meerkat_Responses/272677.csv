   blasts in day 14 BM, now completed HDAC reinduction day +44. Hospital
   course c/b persistent neutropenia and now sepsis physiology. Today
   developped worsening tachypnea with increased O2 requirements
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Has bil;ateral patchy infiltrates, in setting of
   neutropenia and fevers most consistent with a multifocal pneumonia.
   Oxygenation did not improve after thoracentesis on [**5-11**], and BAL on
   [**5-4**] is also negative. The gram stain from BAL and thoracentesis are
   also negative.  Other considerations include pulmonary edema, though
   oxygenation did not improve wioth diuresis. CXR s/p thoracentesis show
   cleared pleural effusuion and no pneumothorax. PE is a consideration
   considering history of malignancy, and echo on [**5-3**] showing interval
   worsening of pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation.  ARDS
   or acute lung injury also a consideration with PaO2/FiO2 265.
   - titrate supplemental O2 to Sats > 90%
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal
   pneumonia
   - EKG and CE to r/o ischemia
   .
   #Hypotension: in setting of fevers, patient meets SIRS criteria with
   likely infectious source being multifocal pneumonia.  Currently fluid
   responsive with increased BP to 117/61 after only 500cc NS.  Over
   diuresis is also a consideration but ins and outs have been inaccurate.
   -fluids for MAP > 65
   -levophed if fluids unresponsive
   -ekg, cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Somnolence: in setting of hypotension and hypoxia and has resolved
   with improved BP and ooxygenation.
   -monitor
   -check lytes
   -low threshold for CT as she presented with a small intracranial bleed.
   .
   #) Fever: Peristent fevers most likely infectious etiology given
   profound neutropenia although drug fever also possibility. Most likely
   source continues to be multifocal pneumonia, although would also
   consider line infection. Also at risk of opportunistic infection with
   disseminated fungus. Infectious eval continues to be negative- only
   positive culture VRE in urine not from clean catch.
   - cont linezolid/ meropenem/ ambisome/ flagyl
   - f/u infectious evaluation with blood/ urine/ sputum cultures
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - ID recs
   - consider adding bactrim or aminoglycoside if patient decompensates
   further
   .
   #)Lower extremity weakness: [**Month (only) 11**] be deconditioing vs. new central
   process, Also with new bladder and bowel incontinence.  patient
   presented with new frontal hypodensity that was subacute in nature
   attriibuted to leukostasis.  Exam is positive for right sided upper and
   lower extremity weakness which has been unchanged since admission.
   -Neuro consult
   -repeat imaging per neuro.
   -repeat UA
   .
   #) AML: s/p induction 7+3 [**3-5**] and reinduction HiDac [**3-25**] chemotherapy,
   Day +44. still with profound neutropenia with no evidence of bone
   marrow recovery. Neupogen has been discontinued as not effective and
   could be contributing to febrile episodes
   - trend CBC w/ diff
   - supportive transfusions for Hct < 25, plt < 10
   - if infectious issues resolve, pt would be candidate for transplant
   .
   #) Tachyarrhthymia: Repeat episodes of SVT likely AVNRT driven by high
   metabolic demands. HR better controlled with B-blockade
   - monitor on tele
   - continue B-blockade and CCB to maintain HR in 80s- 100s as BP will
   tolerate
   - treat infection as above
   .
   #) Elevated alkaline phosphatase: elevated transaminitis developped
   after patient briefly placed on daptomycin and voriconazole. Although
   rest of LFTs have trended down, ALP remains elevated. CT scan w/o
   contrast showed no abnormalities
   - monitor serial abdominal exams
   - consider abdominal US

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presenting with new acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has undergone induction chemotherapy and reinduction therapy but still exhibits profound neutropenia with no evidence of bone marrow recovery. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, which, along with her symptoms of worsening tachypnea and increased oxygen requirements, suggest a multifocal pneumonia. Oxygenation did not improve after thoracentesis or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and gram stain from these procedures was negative. Other considerations include pulmonary edema and pulmonary embolism (PE), but they have been ruled out based on the available information. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury is also a possibility given the PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265. The plan includes titrating supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 90%, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected multifocal pneumonia, and ruling out ischemia through an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzyme tests.

2. Hypotension: The patient meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria due to fevers and likely infectious source being multifocal pneumonia. She responds to fluid resuscitation with an increase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has undergone induction and reinduction chemotherapy. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypoxia, pneumonia, hypotension, fever, somnolence, lower extremity weakness, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing worsening tachypnea and increased oxygen requirements, indicating respiratory distress. Bilateral patchy infiltrates on imaging suggest multifocal pneumonia, which may be causing the hypoxia. Oxygenation did not improve after thoracentesis or diuresis, ruling out pulmonary edema as a cause. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a consideration due to the patient's history of malignancy, although the echo showing worsening pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation points towards right heart strain. ARDS or acute lung injury should be considered with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265.

2. Hypotension: The patient is febrile and hypotensive, meeting SIRS criteria with likely infectious source being multifocal pneumonia. She has received three 500 cc boluses overnight with good effect, indicating fluid responsiveness.

3. Somnolence: The patient is somnolent, likely due to hypotension and hypoxia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yof h/o MDS presenting with new AML requiring chemotherapy, with
   persistent neutropenia, now with worsening respiratory distress,
   hypoxemia and hypotension.
   HYPOXEMIA -- Bilateral patchy infiltrates in neutropenic patent.
   Unclear etiology.  Monitor SaO2, RR, maintain saO2 >90%. Continue
   empirical broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal
   pneumonia.
   HYPOTENSION
 attributed to sepsis and component of hypovolemia.
   Currently fluid responsive. Provide fluids to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   Consider levophed if fluids unresponsive.  Check ECG, cardiac enzymes.
   Consider relative adrenal insufficiency.
   FEVERs -- Peristent fevers most likely reflect infectious etiology.
   Continue linezolid/ meropenem/ ambisome/ flagyl.  F/U infectious
   evaluation with blood/ urine/ sputum cultures.  Trend WBC and fever
   curve.  Check ID recommendations.  Consider adding bactrim or
   aminoglycoside if clinically decompensates.
   LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS
 concern for possible CNS pathology or spinal
   cord lesion.  Would proceed with spine imaging as per Neurology
   consultation.
   AML -- s/p induction.  Neupogen discontinued.  Monitor CBC w/
   differential.  Supportive transfusions for Hct < 25, plt < 10.  Need to
   determine if pt is candidate for transplant .
   TACHYCARDIA -- Repeat episodes of SVT likely AVNRT driven by high
   metabolic demands.   Monitor HR.
   Elevated ALK PHOS
 check RUQ U/S.  Monitor abd exam.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has been receiving chemotherapy. He has persistent neutropenia and is now experiencing worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/58 mmHg to 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG. Physical examination findings include right lower extremity edema, bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, and warm skin without rashes or jaundice. Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemia, likely multifocal pneumonia, sepsis, hypotension, fever, lower extremity weakness, AML, tachycardia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for the mentioned complications."
