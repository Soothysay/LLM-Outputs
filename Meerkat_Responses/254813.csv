","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension who presented with an unresponsive state following a STEMI. The patient had a distal LAD lesion that could not be intervened upon. He was found to be asystolic initially and then developed ventricular fibrillation (Vfib). Cardiac enzymes were elevated on admission, and the patient's ejection fraction (EF) was preserved at 55%. The patient is currently being managed medically in the CCU and undergoing cooling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is hypotensive, which may indicate cardiogenic shock due to the myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient was intubated in the field and should be treated empirically for aspiration pneumonia. There is a need to wean the patient off the ventilator as tolerated after rewarming.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient presented with metabolic acidosis likely from cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. It is important to trend electrolytes and lactate levels.
4. Neurological Impairment: The patient was decorticate posturing upon admission, indicating poor prognosis even with cooling. Continuous EEG monitoring should be maintained, and a head CT should be considered.
5. Transaminitis: The patient may have transaminitis due to the arrest/hypoperfusion or amiodarone use. Trend liver function tests (LFT"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension. The patient presented with an unresponsive state following a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) that was not intervened. The patient is currently being cooled as part of the cooling protocol.

The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes on admission and has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. However, the patient is now hypotensive and likely represents cardiogenic shock versus cooling. The plan is to hold beta blockers while hypotensive/bradycardic from cooling, administer full dose aspirin, and monitor on tele.

The patient also has no known history of heart failure but had an EF of 55% on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non-infarct zone hyperkinesis. The patient's arrest was initially asystole and then progressed to ventricular fibrillation (Vfib). Currently, the patient is in sinus bradycardia on amiodarone gtt and will be switched to 400mg PO BID in am for 7 days. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels should be maintained above 4 and 2, respectively.

The patient was intubated in the field and should be treated empirically for aspiration pneumonia. Focused sputum culture is needed, and cefepime/Flagyl will be administered for an 8-day course. The plan is to we"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  59F with PMHx of HTN found unresponive s/p STEMI
   that was not intervened currently being cooled.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented apparently asystolic and then with Vfib
   from anterior STEMI with distal LAD lesion which could not be
   intervened. Only known risk factor was hypertension. Cardiac enzmes
   elevated on admission. Plan to monitor in CCU and manage medically. EF
   preserved.
   - CE downtrending
   - full dose asa
   - hold beta blockers while hypotensive/bradycardic from cooling
   - 40mg atorvastatin (half dose while on amio gtt)
   - monitor on tele
   - HbA1c = 6.2%
   .
   # PUMP: No known history of heart failure, only htn. Patient had EF55%
   on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
   Now hypotensive which likely represents cardiogenic shock vs cooling.
   -hold ace/bb while hypotensive
   -dopamine to target MAP>60

   # RHYTHM: Patient's arrest was asystole and then Vfib.  Currently in
   sinus brady on amiogtt
   -amio gtt d/ced, now on 400mg PO BID in am (x 7 days)
   -maintain K > 4 and Mg > 2
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated in the field. Should be treated
   empirically for aspiration pnemonia.
   - f/u Sputum culture
   - Cefepime/Flagyl for 8 day course
   - wean vent as tolerated after rewarming
   .
   # AG met acidosis: Present on admission with elevated lactate, likely
   from cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion.
   - lactate downtrending this AM, continue to monitor
   .
   # Neuro: Patient was decorticate posturing on admission to CCU,
   concerning for poor prognosis even with cooling.
   - patient initiated on cooling protocol, plan is for warming @1600
   - consider head CT in am
   - neuro to follow
   - cont EEG monitoring
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely elevated in setting of arrest/hypoperfusion.
   Also started on amio which is unlikely to cause transaminitis so
   acutely.
   -trend LFTS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension. He presented with an unresponsive state following a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) that was not intervened. The patient has been initiated on a cooling protocol and is currently being warmed. He is on mechanical ventilation and has been treated empirically for aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also receiving medications for cardiogenic shock, cardiac enzymes are elevated, and there is evidence of hypoperfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been treated empirically for aspiration pneumonia due to being intubated in the field. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory symptoms or infection.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension may represent cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has a history of elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to the arrest/hypoperfusion or the use of amiodarone. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but no history of bleeding. It is important to monitor hemoglobin levels and consider transfusion if necessary.
5. Hypothermia: The patient is currently undergoing cooling, and after rewarming, it is essential to monitor for any complications related to temperature regulation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was found unresponsive after experiencing a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient presented with ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) and was successfully resuscitated. Due to a distal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was not performed. The patient's cardiac enzymes were elevated upon admission, and there is preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 55%.

The patient has been treated with cardiogenic shock and hypotension, for which dopamine has been initiated to target a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60. The patient is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control, and empirical therapy for aspiration pneumonia has been initiated. Sedation and ventilation are being weaned as tolerated, with plans for extubation if tolerated. The patient's acidosis is being monitored and treated with lactate trending downward.

The patient's neurologic status was initially concerning for poor prognosis, but cooling has been initiated, and plans are underway for warming at 1600. Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring will continue. Transaminitis is suspected due to the arrest and hypoperfusion but is unlikely to be caused by amiodarone. Anemia is not present, and hypertension is currently managed with atenolol, which will be held for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   59F with PMHx of HTN found unresponive s/p STEMI that was not
   intervened currently being cooled.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented apparently asystolic and then with Vfib
   from anterior STEMI with distal LAD lesion which could not be
   intervened. Only known risk factor was hypertension. Cardiac enzymes
   elevated on admission. Plan to monitor in CCU and manage medically. EF
   preserved.
   - CE downtrending
   - full dose asa
   - hold beta blockers while hypotensive/bradycardic from cooling
   - 40mg atorvastatin (half dose while on amio gtt)
   - monitor on tele
   - HbA1c = 6.2%
   .
   # PUMP: No known history of heart failure, only htn. Patient had EF55%
   on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
   Now hypotensive which likely represents cardiogenic shock vs cooling.
   -hold ace/bb while hypotensive
   -dopamine to target MAP>60
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient's arrest was asystole and then Vfib.  Currently in
   sinus brady on amiogtt
   -amio gtt d/ced, now on 400mg PO BID in am (x 7 days)
   -maintain K > 4 and Mg > 2
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated in the field. Should be treated
   empirically for aspiration pnemonia.
   - f/u Sputum culture
   - Cefepime/Flagyl for 8 day course
   - wean vent as tolerated after rewarming
   .
   # AG met acidosis: Present on admission with elevated lactate, likely
   from cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion.
   - lactate downtrending this AM, continue to monitor
   .
   # Neuro: Patient was decorticate posturing on admission to CCU,
   concerning for poor prognosis even with cooling.
   - patient initiated on cooling protocol, plan is for warming @1600
   - consider head CT in am
   - neuro to follow
   - cont EEG monitoring
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely elevated in setting of arrest/hypoperfusion.
   Also started on amio which is unlikely to cause transaminitis so
   acutely.
   -trend LFTS
   .
   # Anemia: No history of anemia. No signs of bleeding.
   -guaic stools
   -tend hct, xfuse hct<28 since active ischemia
   -f/u iron studies

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented unresponsive after experiencing a STEMI that was not intervened. The patient's current condition includes being hypotensive and in cardiogenic shock. She has elevated cardiac enzymes on admission, indicating myocardial damage. The patient's ejection fraction is preserved at 55%. 

The assessment and plan include cooling the patient, monitoring in the CCU, managing medically, and providing full-dose ASA. Beta blockers are to be held while the patient is hypotensive/bradycardic from cooling. Atorvastatin is prescribed at a dose of 40mg (half dose while on amio gtt). Tele monitoring is recommended.

For the pump failure, the patient has no known history of heart failure, but only hypertension. The patient had an EF of 55% on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non-infarct zone hyperkinesis. Now the patient is hypotensive, likely representing cardiogenic shock versus cooling. Dopamine is given to target MAP > 60.

Regarding rhythm, the patient's arrest was initially asystole and then Vfib. Currently, the patient is in sinus brady on amiogtt. Amio gtt dosage is decreased, and the patient is now on 400mg PO BID in am (x 7 days). Efforts are made to maintain K > 4 and Mg > 2.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension. She presented with an unresponsive state after experiencing a STEMI that was not intervened. She currently has a small right apical pneumothorax, which is unchanged from previous evaluations. The central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and feeding tube are also unchanged.

The patient has been cooled as part of the management for her STEMI. She has been intubated in the field and her chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. The plan is to wean sedation and ventilation as tolerated after rewarming, and extubate if tolerated.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated on admission, indicating myocardial injury. She has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. Her blood pressure is low, suggesting cardiogenic shock. Dopamine has been started to target a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

The patient's rhythm has transitioned from asystole and ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) to sinus bradycardia on amiodarone. Amiodarone has been discontinued in favor of oral maintenance therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with adequate oxygenation. Her sputum culture will be followed up, and she will be weaned off ventilatory support as tolerated.

The patient presented with metabolic acidosis on admission, likely due to cardiogenic shock and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, presenting with an unresponsive state following a STEMI. He experienced ventricular fibrillation and was cooled. The patient has preserved ejection fraction but is currently hypotensive, suggesting cardiogenic shock. He is being managed medically in the CCU and will be monitored closely. The patient's condition has shown improvement in terms of neurologic function, and the CT scan shows no acute abnormalities. However, there are concerns regarding potential medical complications such as anemia, transaminitis, and the need for ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct drop this morning could be due to dilutional anemia from recent IVF. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Transaminitis: The patient is likely experiencing elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to the recent cardiac arrest or amiodarone therapy. Monitoring of LFTs is recommended.
3. Neurological Seizure: The EEG showed spikes suggestive of mini-seizures, and the patient is on antiepileptic medication (Keppra).
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low cardiac output indicate a possible cardiogenic shock state. Close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are necessary.
5. Respiratory Support: The patient was intubated in the field and is currently on CPAP/PSV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension.
- He was found unresponsive after experiencing a STEMI (heart attack) that was not intervened.
- The patient's initial heart rhythm was asystole (no heartbeat) and then ventricular fibrillation (irregular and chaotic heart rhythm).
- He is currently in sinus bradycardia (slow heart rate).
- The patient has preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (55%) but with apical dyskinesis (abnormal movement of the heart muscle) and non-infarct zone hyperkinesis (excessive movement of unaffected heart muscle).
- He is hypotensive (low blood pressure) which could be due to cardiogenic shock or cooling.
- The patient's neurologic function has improved, and he is now responding to basic commands.
- His CT scan shows no acute abnormalities.
- The patient's labs indicate elevated cardiac enzymes, transaminitis (liver enzyme elevation), anemia, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient is being managed medically with medications such as atorvastatin, aspirin, and amiodarone.
- He is receiving dopamine to target mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, and he is being weaned off ventilator support.
- His temperature has been normalized.
- Further tests and evaluations are planned, including an echoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension who was found unresponsive after experiencing a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was not intervened and is currently being cooled. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 514 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 438, and a ventilation rate of 6.5 L/min.

The patient has received a transfusion of one unit of blood products. His laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury. Other notable lab findings include a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 103 mg/dL. His renal function tests reveal a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL"
