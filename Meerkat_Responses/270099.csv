","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury who was admitted to the ICU for fevers, abdominal distention, and decreased urine output. He has a history of cardiac arrest, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and previous MRSA bacteremia. The patient's current conditions include leukocytosis, possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), ascites with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), acute renal failure, chronic CHF, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, chronic anemia, anoxic brain damage, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system, especially with the presence of leukocytosis and potential SBP.
2. Liver dysfunction: The abnormal LFTs suggest liver dysfunction, which may be related to his history of shock liver, alcohol use, or other factors. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
3. Renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Proper management is crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Heart failure exacerbation: Given the patient's history of chronic CHF, there is a risk of exacerbation due to fluid overload or infections, which can worsen cardiac function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and ascites. He is currently unresponsive and unable to provide history. The patient has several medical complications including leukocytosis, liver function abnormalities, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, anoxic brain damage, coagulopathy, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high white blood cell count (leukocytosis) and the presence of ascites with an elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The liver function abnormalities and the history of shock liver may indicate compromised liver function. If left untreated, this could result in hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by cognitive impairment and altered mental status.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current acute renal failure, if not addressed, could progress to AKI. This condition can have serious consequences such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chronic heart failure (EF of 20%) increases the risk of pulmonary ed"

   Echo [**2203-1-5**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to
   extensive septal, anterior, and apical akinesis with anterior septal
   dyskinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
   presence of elevated right sided pressures.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-11-23**], no major change.

   -Pull PICC line and culture tip

   -f/u ascites culture
 ASCITES / LFT abnormality
   I suspect his ascites and anasarca is most likely secondary to subacute
   on chronic congestive heart failure, perhaps exacerbated by high sodium
   load from weeks of IV antibiotics. This is supported by BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7462**].
   Second possibility includes biliary obstruction leading to hepatitis
   and decompensated liver failure, although U/S imaging does not support
   this dx. Malignant ascites possible however no signs of cancer.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and a possible history of shock liver. The patient was admitted with chief complaints of abdominal distension and fever. The patient has multiple medical complications including bacteremia, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, leukocytosis, and coagulopathy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 99/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL. The patient also has a high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 79 mg/dL. 

Imaging studies reveal gallbladder wall thickening and sludge, no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, and abdominal ascites. An echocardiogram shows signs of severe right atrial and ventricular dysfunction, severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and a small pericardial effusion"

   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to
   extensive septal, anterior, and apical akinesis with anterior septal
   dyskinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, brought into the emergency department for fevers, abdominal distension, and decreased urine output. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anoxic brain injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and liver dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in clusters, possibly from a line or intracardiac device infection. There are concerns about vancomycin-resistant organisms. The patient's ascites and anasarca are most likely secondary to subacute on chronic congestive heart failure, exacerbated by a high sodium load from weeks of IV antibiotics. Repeat tap is planned to confirm high suspicion of cardiac etiology, large volume paracentesis with albumin support is considered, and peritoneal cytology will be checked. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is concern for prerenal/poor forward flow, abdominal compartment syndrome, or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to hepatic congestion, worsening hepatocellular function, or nutritional deficiency. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is stable. The patient's disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible infection. If the infection spreads and causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), it can lead to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This could be due to prerenal/poor forward flow, abdominal compartment syndrome, or hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has liver dysfunction, and the presence of ascites and hepatic congestion could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The high sodium load from IV antibiotics may exacerbate heart failure, leading to worsening cardiac function.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for developing another one, especially given immobility in the ICU setting.
6. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (INR). Imaging studies reveal gallbladder wall thickening and sludge, no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, CBD measures 5 mm, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to
   extensive septal, anterior, and apical akinesis with anterior septal
   dyskinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of abdominal distension. The patient has a history of shock liver, alcohol use, and congestive heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 99/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, liver function abnormalities in a cholestatic pattern, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic anemia, and coagulopathy. Imaging shows gallbladder wall thickening and sludge, no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, and abdominal ascites. An echocardiogram reveals severe dysfunction of the left and right ventricles, mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and a small pericardial effusion. The patient has multiple medical complications including decubitus ulcer, ascites, liver function abnormalities, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and potential coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylactic measures, and lines. The patient's code status is full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of shock liver in 9-10, unknown ETOH use, possible CHF, and concern for cholestasis. He presents with abdominal distension, leukocytosis, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, chronic heart failure (EF 20%), anemia, coagulopathy, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, coronary artery disease (CAD), and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile at rehab, and there are concerns about possible bacteremia or infection leading to sepsis. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been started.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites and leukocytosis, which raises concern for SBP. Ascites fluid culture is pending.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of shock liver and liver function abnormalities, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with decreased urine output. Causes include prerenal poor forward flow, abdominal compartment syndrome, and possible sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, systolic heart failure (EF 20%), chronic anemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with fevers, abdominal distension, and decreased urine output. He has been febrile at the rehabilitation center but is afebrile now. The patient's blood culture from 2203-1-4 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, and his urine culture from 2202-12-31 grew Proteus. The patient has several medical complications, including leukocytosis, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, chronic heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, coronary artery disease, and bacteremia. He is currently being treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia. The patient's abdominal ascites and liver function abnormalities may be related to his history of shock liver in 9-10, ETOH abuse, and possibly congestive heart failure (CHF). The SAAG (Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient) is consistent with portal hypertension. The patient also has acute renal failure and chronic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient is being treated empirically for SBP, which is an infection of the ascitic fluid. This can be a life-threatening condition if not promptly treated.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current conditions can be summarized as follows:

Chief Complaint: Abdominal distension

The patient has a history of shock liver, ethanol abuse, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). They also have a history of anoxic brain injury, systolic CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), leukocytosis, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and coagulopathy.

Current Assessment:
- Ascites: The patient has developed significant ascites, which may be related to CHF, liver dysfunction, or portal hypertension.
- Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection.
- Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. Hepatitis serologies show prior infections but no current evidence of hepatitis C.
- Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to poor forward flow or abdominal compartment syndrome.
- Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a severely reduced EF of 20%.
- Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely due to iron deficiency.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated INR, possibly due to hepatic congestion, worsening hepatocellular function, or nutritional factors.

 ASCITES / LFT abnormality
   I suspect his ascites and anasarca is most likely secondary to subacute

   load from weeks of IV antibiotics. This is supported by BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7462**].
   Second possibility includes biliary obstruction leading to hepatitis
   and decompensated liver failure, although U/S imaging does not support

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. He was admitted to the emergency department for fevers, abdominal distention, and decreased urine output. He has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic anemia.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 93 bpm, blood pressure 95/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on a tracheostomy. The patient is unresponsive and unable to follow simple commands.

The patient has a PICC line in place, which was stopped on 01/06/2023 at 12:37 PM. An ultrasound was performed on the same day at 02:32 PM, and paracentesis was done at 03:28 PM. During the paracentesis, 2.5 liters of ascites fluid were tapped, which is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The ascites fluid analysis showed a white blood cell count of 560* cells/mL, with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (71%). The ascites chemistry revealed a total protein of 4.7 g/dL, glucose of 81 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 134 IU/L, and albumin of 1.9 g/dL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of total bilirubin (2.3 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase (AST) of 81 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 46 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) of 876 U/L, total protein of 8.7 g/dL, and albumin of 2.6 g/dL. The blood cultures are pending, showing growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is currently on cefepime, which should cover Staphylococcus pneumoniae, and also receiving linezolid.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, which may explain the ascites and anasarca. However, further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and he may need diuresis and strict intake and output measurements. Given the high-grade bacteremia, it is important to hold Coreg, a medication used for heart failure, until the infection is under control. The patient's coagulopathy should be monitored, and the elevated INR may be due to hepatic congestion, worsening hepatocellular function, or nutritional factors. Anoxic brain injury is stable, and there are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, the potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, which is a bloodstream infection. This can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output. This may progress to acute renal failure if not managed properly.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.

4. Sepsis: The combination of bacteremia, organ dysfunction (liver and kidneys), and the presence of ascites increases the risk of developing sepsis. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care is crucial.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of upper extremity DVT. There is a risk of recurrent DVT or pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is not maintained.

6. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a preexisting decubitus ulcer, indicating the possibility of developing further pressure ulcers, especially in areas of prolonged pressure.

7. Anoxic brain damage: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the past, which can"

 ASCITES / LFT abnormality
   I suspect his ascites and anasarca is most likely secondary to subacute

   load from weeks of IV antibiotics. This is supported by BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7462**].
   Second possibility includes biliary obstruction leading to hepatitis
   and decompensated liver failure, although U/S imaging does not support
   this dx. Malignant ascites possible however no signs of cancer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, cardiac arrest, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, brought into the emergency department for fevers, abdominal distention, and decreased urine output. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, ascites, liver function abnormalities, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, chronic anemia, decubitus ulcer, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and anoxic brain damage. The patient's current condition includes elevated INR, high sodium load from weeks of IV antibiotics, and potential cardiac etiology for ascites. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has multiple positive blood cultures indicating an ongoing infection.
2. Ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, which can lead to respiratory distress and increased risk of infection.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction or damage.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels, suggesting impaired kidney function.
5. Chronic Anemia: The patient has a chronic low red blood cell count, which can cause fatigue and weakness.
6. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pressure ulcer present at admission, which can lead to infection and tissue damage if not properly managed.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating impaired blood clotting ability.
8. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
9. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has diabetes, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemia.
10. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has suffered brain damage due to lack of oxygen, which can result in long-term neurological deficits.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be required for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic heart failure (EF 20%), chronic anemia (hct stable), type II diabetes mellitus, and a history of coronary artery disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to bacteremia caused by coag-negative Staphylococcus, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

On overnight review, the patient received albumin per SBP protocol. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which was negative for vegetations. The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, and surveillance cultures have also shown no growth. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/67 mmHg to 208/154 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on T-piece. The patient is awake and alert, with normal movement of extremities but not following commands.

Physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place, with coarse breath sounds and no air bronchospasm. The abdomen is noted to be non-tender, with positive distension and no air bronchospasm. Neurological examination shows the patient to be awake and alert, with movement of extremities but no command-following.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, dilated cardiomyopathy (20%), MRSA bacteremia, tongue biting after total dental extraction, and suspected chronic liver disease. He was febrile at rehab with increasing abdominal girth, positive blood cultures, and a proteus urinary tract infection. He is currently in the ICU with progressive acute renal failure and peritonitis. He has undergone paracentesis and received albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low ejection fraction, right heart failure, and chronic respiratory failure. He is intubated and on T-piece oxygen. The patient's neurological prognosis is poor, and a family meeting was held to discuss the situation. The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal support, and management of congestive heart failure and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, peritonitis, and UTI, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's suspected chronic liver disease and increasing abdominal girth, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's progressive acute renal failure may worsen without appropriate management.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a low ejection fraction and right heart failure, putting him at risk for further"

   signs
   of overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pleural effusions, mild
   retrocardiac
   atelectasis.
   Microbiology: Blood cx x 2 from [**1-6**], [**1-7**], and [**1-8**] still pending. Sputum
   shows cefepime resistant psuedamonas, sensitive to meropenem.
   Pt is a 43 y.o male with h.o anoxic brain injury(non-verbal,
   PEG/Trach), s/p MI, s/p cardiac arrest EF 20%, HTN, HL, DM, recent MRSA
   bacteremia who presents with increased abdominal swelling,
   transaminitis, ARF.
 BACTEREMIA: US of ICD negative for infection, TEE negative for
   vegatations, PICC line negative for growth, however intracardiac device
   is a concerning source for occult infection.  Two sets of blood cx from
   [**1-4**] w/ coag neg staph, one bottle sig for coag pos staph all
   vancomycin sensitive.
   -- ID consult in am for abx duration

   -- DC flagyl as no culture data to support its need
   -- DC cefepime and START meropenem as both sputum psuedomonas and urine
   proteus are sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 430**].
   -- F/u blood cultures (surveillance cx have since shown no growth)
   -- PICC line in AM for likely long course of antibiotics.
   -- F/u ascites cultures
 ASCITES/TRANSAMINITIS: Likely secondary to progressive severe sCHF
   leading to congestive hepatopathy however LFTs do not quite fit this
   picture.  While LFT
s not c/w CHF, BNP elevated and echo remarkable for
   severe RHF (severe TR) and poor EF (20%).  While his rise in LFTs are
   consistent w/ cholestatic picture, US w/o evidence of biliary
   obstruction.  INR elevated secondary to nutrition vs synthetic
   dysfunction. Previous serologies: c/w prior hep a, prior hep B, no
   hepc; h/o shock liver in [**9-10**].
   -- F/u ascites cultures and cytology
   -- Cont abx (see above): treating staph bacteremia, uti, hap and SBP
   empirically
   -- Holding off on diuresis given bacteremia
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Cr improving.
   Likely related to poor forward flow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recent MRSA bacteremia. The patient presents with increased abdominal distension, transaminitis, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and is currently being treated for staph bacteremia, urinary tract infection, hepatobiliary infection, and possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There is also a concern for an occult infection from the intracardiac device.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and evidence of cholestasis. This could potentially lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.

3. Cardiogenic shock: With an ejection fraction of only 20%, the patient is at risk for cardiogenic shock, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has coarse rhonchi in his lungs and is on a T-piece, indicating a need for respiratory support. This suggests a risk of respiratory failure"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recent MRSA bacteremia. He presents with increased abdominal swelling, transaminitis, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, along with the presence of ascites and elevated liver enzymes, suggest impaired liver function. Hepatic encephalopathy can occur as a result of liver dysfunction.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's coarse rhonchi on lung examination and mild retrocardiac atelectasis seen on chest X-ray indicate compromised respiratory function. This may progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a low ejection fraction (20%), which indicates reduced cardiac function. This increases the risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even cardiac arrest.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the repeat ultrasound did not show any clot, the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The patient presents with increased abdominal distension, transaminitis, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues including chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient also has a history of anoxic brain damage, a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, and a past cardiac arrest.

The patient's current laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but sputum shows cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive to meropenem.

The patient's imaging findings reveal no relevant changes in the chest X-ray compared to the previous examination. There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or evidence of infection in the intra-cardiac device (ICD) or pericardial effusion on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, respiratory failure due to the presence of cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, further deterioration of renal function, and potential liver complications due to elevated liver enzymes. Additionally, the patient's chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and anemia require ongoing management.

Overall, the patient's clinical status is concerning, and close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to address the ongoing medical issues and prevent further complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recent MRSA bacteremia. He presents with increased abdominal distension, transaminitis, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and currently shows signs of coag-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. The source of infection is still pending, but the intracardiac device is a concerning source for occult infection. ID consult has been requested for antibiotic duration, and the patient will continue on vancomycin. PICC line has been placed for long-term antibiotic administration.

2. Ascites/Transaminitis: The patient has ascites with elevated BNP levels and worsening right heart failure (severe tricuspid regurgitation) and poor ejection fraction (20%). The rise in liver function tests is consistent with a cholestatic picture, but there is no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound. INR is elevated secondary to malnutrition versus synthetic dysfunction. Ascites cultures and cytology should be followed up.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are improving, likely related to poor forward flow"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recent MRSA bacteremia. He presents with increased abdominal distension, transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes), acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by coagulation-negative Staphylococcus, and there is a concern for vancomycin-resistant organism. He is currently on linezolid, cefepime, and metronidazole, but the cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is sensitive to meropenem.

The patient also has ascites/transaminitis, which may be related to his worsening right heart failure (severe tricuspid regurgitation) and poor left ventricular ejection fraction. The rise in liver enzymes could be consistent with a cholestatic picture, but there is no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and findings on the echocardiogram suggest worsening right heart failure.

The patient's renal function is improving, likely due to poor forward flow. It is recommended to continue monitoring his fluid balance and electroly"

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and recent MRSA bacteremia. He presents with increased abdominal distension, transaminitis, and acute renal failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including chronic heart failure with an EF of 20%, severe tricuspid regurgitation, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain damage, and a history of deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). His blood cultures are pending, and he has been started on antibiotics empirically to treat staph bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's imaging shows no relevant changes in his chest X-ray, with findings of unchanged tracheostomy tube position, unchanged pacemaker leads, small lung volumes, cardiomegaly without signs of overt pulmonary edema, and mild retrocardiac atelectasis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing current antibiotics, following up with blood cultures (surveillance cultures have shown no growth), following up with ascites cultures, and monitoring the fever curve. Additionally, the patient's renal failure is likely related to poor forward flow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and chronic liver disease. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including MRSA bacteremia, tongue biting after total dental extraction, suspected chronic liver disease, progressive acute renal failure (ARF), ascites, and sepsis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for various infections, including a possible pseudomonas infection in the sputum, proteus urinary tract infection (UTI), and peritonitis. The patient also has a history of ethanol use, right heart failure, and congestive heart failure. He is being closely monitored for acute renal failure, chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy and T-piece oxygenation, and requires cardiac support with Coreg and ASA. The patient's poor neurological prognosis was discussed during a family meeting with his brother, sister, and social worker.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA bacteremia: The patient is already receiving treatment for MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin and flagyl. Close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The presence of a pseudomonas infection in the sputum requires appropriate treatment with antibiotics effective against pseudomonas, such as [Last Name (un) 430]. Regular monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and sputum culture results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, chronic liver disease, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to MRSA bacteremia, tongue biting after total dental extraction, and possible chronic liver disease. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications including severe right heart failure, acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Right Heart Failure (RHF): The patient's TEE revealed severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation) and poor EF (ejection fraction) of 20%. This indicates compromised right ventricular function, which can lead to symptoms such as peripheral edema, ascites, and hepatomegaly. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuretic therapy is essential to manage fluid overload and prevent further deterioration.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury. ARF may be attributed to poor forward flow due to heart failure or potentially toxic effects of certain medications. Frequent monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary.

3. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): With an EF of 20%, the patient has significant systolic dysfunction. The management plan includes increasing the dose of carvedilol and holding ACE inhibitors temporarily due to acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, previous heart failure, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including sepsis, renal failure, chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to multiple bacterial infections including coag-negative staphylococci, MRSA, and pseudomonas. It is crucial to continue treating the infections aggressively with appropriate antibiotics and maintain source control.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, likely related to poor forward flow. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is necessary. Renal dosing of medications should be considered.
3. Chronic heart failure: The patient has a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Optimization of heart failure medications, such as increasing the dose of carvedilol, is recommended. Diuretics may need to be initiated cautiously due to the current bacteremia.
4. Chronic anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable but in the mid-to-high 20s, indicating chronic anemia. Iron deficiency should be addressed,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, chronic liver disease, and multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of MRSA bacteremia, severe sepsis, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors for septic shock. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has a distended abdomen and positive fluid balance. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and signs of acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and severe sepsis, which can lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a concern for ARDS due to the potential lung infection and fluid overload.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate AKI, possibly related to poor renal perfusion secondary to severe sepsis and heart failure.
4. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF exacerbation is evident from his symptoms of dyspnea, edema, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 45M anoxic brain injury s/p VFA during VT
   abalation, DCM (20%), MRSA bacteremia, tongue biting s/p total dental
   extraction, ?chronic liver disease. Ongoing treatment of bacteremia /
   peritonitis / UTI / +/- pneumonia.
   Agree with plan to manage staph bacteremia / proteus UTI / peritonitis
   / possible nosocomial pneumonia with vanco to level / [**Last Name (un) 430**] via PICC x
   14d total, TEE without vegitation, d/w ID re duration of rx and f/u.
   New ascites / cirrhosis - continue abx for peritonitis, resume lasix
   today / aldactone in AM, LFTs are improving. ARF likely poor forward
   flow, creatinine / UOP stable, renal dose meds, resume diuretics as
   above. DCM - continue asa / coreg / lasix. TFs, +BM, PICC today; will
   try to meet with mother to discuss overall situation. Remainder of plan
   as outlined above.
Recent MRSA, CNS BSI, likely related to now removed RUE
PICC.  The susceptibility profile of this MRSA is dissimilar from
prior MRSA and the occurrence of the MRSA admixed with CNS
Rx 2 weeks with
IV vanco.  Patient may or may not have HAP/VAP due to Pseudomonas
and/or Staph.  A mini-BAL might have been useful to quantify the
organisms.  Since his CXR has improved and he has received
several days of rx, reasonable to complete rx with higher dose
and extended infusion [**Last Name (un) 430**] for PA with MIC 4 (relatively high
MIC).  Rx 14 days.  Moderate degree of neutrophilic ascites, but
negative cx.  Current broad abx will cover most SBP pathogens,
although it is not certain that he has this dx. Would send
additional stool for Cdiff.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, chronic heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis, including MRSA bacteremia, peritonitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possibly nosocomial pneumonia. The patient has a complicated medical history, including a recent episode of MRSA bacteremia, central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia, and a likely source from a removed right upper extremity (RUE) PICC line. He also has chronic liver disease with ascites, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, and severe systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated. The presence of MRSA bacteremia, peritonitis, UTI, and possible nosocomial pneumonia increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Chronic Liver Disease: The patient's history of chronic liver disease puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ascites and bacteremia. The patient has a history of shock liver in 9-10, ethanol abuse, and may also be related to congestive heart failure (CHF). There are concerns for cholestasis as well. The patient's liver function abnormalities are in a predominantly cholestatic pattern, and hepatic serologies from a previous month show evidence of prior hepatitis A, prior hepatitis B, and no hepatitis C. The patient has leukocytosis and is being treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient also has acute renal failure, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic anemia, pressure ulcers, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain damage due to a prolonged period of cardiac arrest, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBP: The patient is being treated empirically for SBP, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver dysfunction and elevated ammonia levels can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, causing altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has evidence of prior hepatitis A and B infections, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, chronic liver disease, and multiple comorbidities. He presented to the ICU with ascites, bacteremia, and signs of heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and medications for his chronic conditions. His current condition is stable, but he continues to have ongoing complications such as renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and chronic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%). He is at risk for worsening heart failure symptoms and complications such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, and fluid overload.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate abnormalities in a predominantly cholestatic pattern. This could be secondary to congestive hepatopathy due to severe right heart failure. There is a concern for potential liver decompensation and development of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function leading to oliguria, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has persistent bacteremia despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. This may indicate a new line source of infection or antibiotic resistance. There is a risk of sepsis and septic shock if the infection is"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M anoxic brain injury s/p VFA during VT abalation, DCM (20%), MRSA
   bacteremia, tongue biting s/p total dental extraction, ?chronic liver
   disease. Reportedly febrile at rehab with increasing abd girth, +BCx,
   proteus UTI, peritonitis treated with vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for coag negative
   staph, MRSA bacteremia, SBP and pseudomonas/MRSA in sputum.
 BACTEREMIA: Coag neg staph x 2, MRSA.  Per ID likely new line source
   rather than relapse from prior MRSA bacteremia.
   -- Continue vanc for 14 day treatment course (start date [**1-5**])
   --new PICC placed
   Sputum with MRSA and pseudomonas, this does not likely represents true
   infection. Also with SBP (though cultures have not grown) and treated
   with broad specs. TEE negative.

   -- f/u ascites cx, prelim negative
   -- F/u blood cultures (surveillance cx have since shown no growth)
   -- PICC line ordered, not placed yesterday given fever
 ASCITES/TRANSAMINITIS: Likely secondary to progressive severe sCHF
   leading to congestive hepatopathy, BNP elevated and echo remarkable for
   severe RHF (severe TR) and poor EF (20%).  While his rise in LFTs are
   consistent w/ cholestatic picture, US w/o evidence of biliary
   obstruction.  INR elevated secondary to nutrition vs synthetic
   dysfunction. Previous serologies: c/w prior hep a, prior hep B, no
   hepc; h/o shock liver in [**9-10**].
   -- Cont lasix for diuresis
   -- Restart home aldactone 25mg daily
   -- F/u ascites cultures

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC: EF 20% on TEE; Severe TR.
   -- Continue Carvedilol, can increase back to home dose as an outpatient
   as BP tolerates
