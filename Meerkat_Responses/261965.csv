","The patient's medical history is significant for a recent episode of angioedema attributed to the use of ativan. The patient is currently on Valproate for seizure management and has had an EEG done, which showed no active seizure at the time. The patient also has a history of anaphylaxis to Dilantin. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side. Their heart rate has been fluctuating between 75 and 160 beats per minute, with an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 160s. The respiratory rate is normal, and the patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,277 mL and output of 284 mL over the past 24 hours. 

In terms of lab results, the patient's white blood cell count has increased from 8.3 K/uL to 9.6 K/uL, and their hematocrit has increased from 27.3% to 33.0%. The platelet count has also increased from 345 K/uL to 430 K/uL. However, the creatinine level has risen from 9.0 mg/dL to 14.5 mg/dL, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. 

Other notable lab results include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) status post failed kidney transplant, recent exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis, who presents with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS). The patient's mental status has improved overnight, and she is now alert and follows commands. The angioedema has also significantly improved. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and urea nitrogen, but decreased levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had an episode of decreased responsiveness, which could be due to a postictal state or medication effect. An urgent EEG is needed to further evaluate for seizures.
2. Angioedema: The patient may have angioedema, possibly related to the administration of ativan. It is important to hold ativan and monitor the patient closely.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, likely due to medication effect from propofol. The patient's blood pressure has been managed with fentanyl and metoprolol.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a failed kidney transplant, who presented with acute mental status changes (AMS).
- AMS was likely due to a postictal state or medication effect, specifically lorazepam (Ativan) and propofol. The mental status has now improved.
- Head CT and toxicology screens were negative, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) yesterday showed no abnormalities.
- The patient may have experienced angioedema, which could have been caused by Ativan administration. Both Ativan and lisinopril have been held due to this concern.
- The patient has ESRD on HD and missed two outpatient HD sessions. She was dialyzed yesterday in the MICU.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation on warfarin, with an INR that is currently subtherapeutic. It is unclear if the patient is compliant with home medications.
- Metoprolol has been restarted for rate control, and warfarin will be restarted once the patient is extubated.
- The patient has hypertension, which is being treated with metoprolol.
- The patient has hyperlipidemia, for which a statin is being continued.
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus, for which ris"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who had a failed kidney transplant and underwent an exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis. She presented with acute mental status changes (AMS) but is now responsive and alert.

Assessment and plan:

1. Altered Mental Status: The episode of decreased responsiveness was likely due to a postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan, propofol). Her mental status is now appropriate. Head CT and toxicology screens were negative. EEG (preliminary) was negative for status. It is recommended to hold off on using ativan for any recurrent seizures as it may have been responsible for her angioedema yesterday. Neurology follow-up is advised, and depakote is being continued for now with daily checks on the level. Keppra is also being continued, and micro follow-up is planned. Daily HD is recommended to treat uremia, and seizure precautions should be taken.

2. Angioedema: This may have been caused by ativan administration. Steroids have been given for 24 hours, but there is still no cuff leak today. The patient has a history of possible tracheal stenosis, so she may not develop a cuff leak. It is advised to hold ativan"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.
   -- neuro following

   #angioedema- may have been due to ativan administration.   Given
   steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak today.  Has h/o
   ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who underwent a failed kidney transplant and had an exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis. She presented with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS) and was intubated for airway protection. She has persistent apnea of unclear etiology, even when awake. The patient also has a history of tracheal stenosis after a previous tracheostomy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 112/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation (MMV) with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 344 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.9 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 72 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 14.5 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 27 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 138 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 99 mEq/L, glucose of 63 mg/dL, and a pH of 7.46. Other lab values include elevated levels of troponin-T, lactate acid, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to altered mental status, altered mental status likely due to postictal state and medication effect, angioedema possibly related to ativan administration, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The patient is also being treated for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has a code status of full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who had a failed kidney transplant and underwent surgery for benign pneumatosis. She presented with acute mental status changes. The patient's mental status is now appropriate, and head CT and toxic screens were negative. EEG results are pending. The patient is being held on ativan due to possible angioedema and will need an outpatient allergy workup. She is anticipated for extubation later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient may be at risk for angioedema due to the administration of ativan and lisinopril. These medications should be held, and she should be monitored closely.
2. Tracheal stenosis: The patient has a history of tracheal stenosis, which may affect her ability to develop a cough reflex and could complicate extubation.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient has missed two outpatient HD sessions and requires daily dialysis to treat uremia. Renal dosing of medications should be continued, and nephrocaps and sensipar should be continued as well.
4. Atrial fibrillation on coumadin: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and it is unclear if the patient is compliant with home medications. Metoprolol for rate control should be restarted overnight, and IV beta-blocker"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. He has been on various medications including coumadin, dilantin, percocet, and motrin. The patient has had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, which have been managed with juice. He is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation support with a FiO2 of 40%. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/64 mmHg and a heart rate of 69 bpm. The patient's recent lab results show elevated creatinine levels and a slightly low white blood cell count. The assessment and plan include ICU care, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, which can lead to serious complications if not promptly managed.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including elevated potassium and low magnesium, which can affect cardiac function and neuromuscular activity.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal dysfunction, which may progress to acute kidney injury or require dialysis.

6. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly low, which may indicate an increased risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or leukopenia, is essential.

7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's reliance on CPAP/PSV ventilation support indicates respiratory distress or dysfunction. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or anticoagulation, should be implemented.

9. Stress Ulcer Disease: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcer development, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular surveillance cultures and early identification of symptoms are crucial for prompt"

   likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis, transferred to MICU
   after intubation for airway protection following a seizure +/-
   angioedema secondary to ?ativan.

   post-ictal state +/- angioedema secondary to ?ativan.  Was apneic and
   without cuff leak initially.  Extubated yesterday and doing well now on
   room air.
   2.  AMS.  Admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to
   missing dialysis and opioids at home.  Her mental status now is
   appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative.   EEG (prelim)
   negative for status.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who underwent a failed kidney transplant. She was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis. The patient experienced airway protection after a seizure and possible angioedema due to?ativan. She was initially intubated but successfully extubated yesterday and is now doing well on room air.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Airway: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema secondary to?ativan. She was extubated yesterday and is currently stable on room air.
2. AMS: The patient was admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to missing dialysis and opioids at home. Her mental status is now appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative. EEG (prelim) is negative for status.
3. Angioedema: This may have been caused by ativan administration. The patient was given steroids but still did not develop a cuff leak yesterday. She has a history of possible tracheal stenosis, so she may not ever develop a cuff leak.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient is currently on dialysis to treat uremia. She will continue to receive daily dialysis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- depakote [**Hospital1 **], will taper dose per neuro
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   #angioedema- may have been due to ativan administration.   Given
   steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak today.  Has h/o
   ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed 2 outpatient HD sessions. Dialyzed yesterday in
   MICU.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal
   -- continue nephrocaps and sensipar
   -- renally dose meds
   -- epo at HD
   .
   # Afib on coumadin
   -- INR subtherapeutic; unclear if pt is compliant with home meds.
   -- metoprolol for rate control
restarted overnight
   -- IV BB prn RVR
   --restart coumadin today
   .
   # HTN: on metoprolol and amlodipine. Discontinue lisinopril due to
   association with angioedema.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  -- Con't statin
   .
   # DM:
   -- RISS, FSG qid,
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV , has HD cath for emergency.  has had previous central
   venous DVT. Trying for PICC today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) status post failed kidney transplant, recent exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis, who presents with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require management:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. Now, with persistent apnea of unclear etiology even when awake, the plan is to try to extubate today with anesthesia present in case of urgent reintubation.
2. Altered mental status: The episode of decreased responsiveness is likely due to a postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan, propofol). Head CT and tox screens were negative. EEG (prelim) negative for status. Neurology follow-up is recommended, and the patient will be tapered off depakote per neuro. The patient will continue on keppra at 500 mg and receive an extra dose with HD. Daily HD is planned to treat uremia, and seizure precautions are in place.
3. Angioedema: The patient may have experienced angioedema possibly due to ativan administration. Steroids have been given for 24 hours, but the patient still lacks a cuff leak today. A history of tracheal stenosis may prevent the development of a cuff"
