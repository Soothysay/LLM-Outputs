   # ULCERATIVE COLITIS / GI BLEEDING: Given known UC and recent dual
   antiplatelet therapy, suspect exacerbation of underlying inflammatory
   process. Given UGI ulcer however would consider Crohn's disease in
   differential diagnosis. Pt is s/p local therapy for both LGI ulcers and
   UGI ulcer.

   R to L shunt through PFO. She underwent PFO closure on [**3-14**]. After
   closure attempts to diuresis has been unsuccessful. Patient had
   previously been on Lasix gtt and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with poor UOP and
   increasing creatinine and previously required midodrine to maintain
   increased SVR to allow diuresis.  Renal was consulted on [**2108-3-18**] for
   possible ultrafitration/HD to remove excess fluid.  For now, will hold
   on diuresis as there is concern for patient becoming hemodynamically
   unstable from further bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis, GI bleeding, severe right ventricular dysfunction, and gross volume overload. She underwent percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. The patient presented from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after successful C-Scope and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), in stable condition.

24-hour events:
The patient has allergies to lisinopril, which caused a rash and abdominal pain, as well as hives from cefazolin sodium and sulfa antibiotics. The last dose of antibiotics was given intravenously. The patient is currently receiving various infusions and other medications.

Review of systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the following:

Vital signs:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm with a range of 64-77 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 99/69 mmHg to 154/97 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute with a range of 7-19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation (AF) as the heart rhythm.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient has a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is being treated with blood transfusions and medications to reduce stomach acid production.

2. The patient has severe biventricular heart failure and a recent correction of a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO).

3. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress but is currently stable on supplemental oxygen.

4. The patient has multiple sources of bleeding in the GI tract, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and superficial ulcerations in the sigmoid colon, likely related to ulcerative colitis.

5. The patient underwent patent foramen ovale closure surgery and is being advised to continue taking ASA and Plavix due to the presence of a PFO that was previously occluded.

6. The patient is anemic due to blood loss and requires further transfusions to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level of 30.

7. The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) that is rate-controlled.

8. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure and is being evaluated for ultrafiltration.

9. The patient is experiencing hypothermia and is being considered for re-evaluation of thyroid function tests (TFT) and adrenal axis.

10. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) pending completion of an evaluation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. They have a history of severe biventricular failure, recent correction of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), and multiple sources of bleeding including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and ulcerative colitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/43 mmHg to 154/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is extubated and remains on ASA and Plavix. They continue to experience melena (black, tarry stools), indicating ongoing GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing melena suggests that there may still be active bleeding in the GI tract. This could lead to further blood loss, anemia, and potential shock.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is slightly low at 36.5°C (97.7°F), which could be due to the stress of critical illness or inadequate warming in the ICU.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. This could be related to the patient's underlying conditions or acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory distress: Although the patient"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis, severe right ventricular dysfunction, and previous percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). She presented to the ICU after undergoing a colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to persistent melena. The patient has been experiencing poor urine output despite receiving blood transfusions and diuretics, and her hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly. She is also hypothermic and has chronic atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:
1. Ulcerative Colitis/GI Bleeding: The patient has persistent melena despite previous interventions for gastrointestinal bleeding. She requires further monitoring and may need additional interventions from the gastroenterology department.
2. Right Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has severe right ventricular dysfunction leading to biventricular diastolic dysfunction. This condition is causing fluid overload and requires management with diuretics and other cardiac supportive measures.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is low, and the cause is unclear. It may be related to her underlying medical conditions or other factors.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, which could be secondary to the use of diuretics. She may require hemodialysis for filtration.
5. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) Closure: The patient"

   # ULCERATIVE COLITIS / GI BLEEDING:   Persistent.  Patient s/p ligation
   and epinephrine injection of ulcers in duodenum, and colon.  Patient
   HCT has dropped from 26
 23 and is having melena.  Patient was on dual
   antiplatelets for the PFO closure device.  Patient was in ICU for
   monitoring.  At this point, patient
s transfusion goal should be > 30
   given her other underlying medical issues, but pt. has been refusing
   transfusion to that goal. Was transfused one unit last night and Hct
   bumped appropriately to 25 this morning and now stable at 24.  Per GI
   ok to move to cards floor for diuresis. Discontinued plavix and now on
   only 81mg ASA. Holding anticoagulation for afib given bleeding.

   # R CHF: 2/2 L sided diastolic dysfunction.  Patient with biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction.  Patient with small persistent PFO, despite
   closure.  Patient had been on Lasix gtt and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with
   poor UOP and increasing creatinine and previously required midodrine to
   maintain increased SVR to allow diuresis.  Renal was consulted on
   [**2108-3-18**] for possible ultrafitration/HD to remove excess fluid.  For
   now, will administer lasxi drip with metolazone. Pt. extremely lasix
   resistant, did not put out to 100mg bolus and then 200mg bolus of lasix
   last night.
   - Lasix drip
   - Metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfer to cardiology floor for diuresis

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She underwent ligation and epinephrine injection of ulcers in the duodenum and colon.
- The patient has severe volume overload, right heart failure (RHF), persistent melena, and unresponsive urine output despite diuretic therapy.
- She has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 25.3% and is refusing blood transfusion.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 3.1.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO).
- The patient is currently on low-dose aspirin and holding anticoagulation due to bleeding risk.
- She is experiencing hypothermia with a low body temperature.
- The patient is at risk for further complications such as acute respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and presence of crackles in the lungs suggest a risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring and supporting respiratory function will be crucial.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's advanced"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and severe biventricular failure, which was recently corrected due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair. The patient also has respiratory distress, anemia secondary to blood loss, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), acute on chronic renal failure, hypothermia, and requires nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has multiple sources of GI bleeding, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and superficial ulcerations in the sigmoid colon. This can lead to further blood loss and potential shock.
2. Severe Biventricular Failure: The patient's heart is failing to pump blood effectively, leading to reduced cardiac output. This can result in organ dysfunction and poor perfusion.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, requiring supplemental oxygen. Prolonged respiratory distress can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Anemia: Due to blood loss, the patient has developed anemia. Severe anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. CHF: The patient's heart failure is affecting both ventricles, resulting in fluid accumulation and organ congestion. This can lead to worsening cardiac function and systemic complications.
6. A-Fib: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation"

   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will

   - Renal will continue to follow and leave recs for CVVH
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction
   - Will continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Will continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence
   this does improve diastolic CHF.

   I now believe that the PFO closure has resulted in worsening of her
   hemodynamics.  I further believe now that her pulmonary vascular
   resistance on prior right heart catheterizations was grossly
   underestimated due to right-to-left shunting across her PFO during
   procedures that resulted in spurious elevation of mixed venous arterial
   saturation, hence a falsely elevated cardiac output.  This would result
   in gross underestimation of PVR due to overestimation of CO and the
   fact that only part of the CO was crossing the pulmonary vascular bed.
   Today I plan to do another right heart cath to obtain what I believe
   will be
uncontaminated
 hemodynamic numbers, now that the PFO is at
   least largely closed.  I believe that this will demonstrate a much
   higher PVR than was evident on the previous caths.  I plan to do a
   pulmonary arteriolar vasodilator trial because I now think that what
   [**Known firstname 3799**] may really have is idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and NOT
   diastolic dysfunction of the LV as her primary underlying problem.  If
   this hypothesis bears out, then the treatment focus shifts to pulmonary
   arteriolar vasodilation as the primary goal.  I have discussed this at

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes a percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with mild residual shunt, ulcerative colitis (UC), and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and acute decompensated diastolic failure.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing GI bleeding, hypotension, anasarca, peripheral edema, and an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) greater than 15 cm. Her laboratory results show acute kidney injury (AKI) with an increase in serum creatinine, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, which is likely due to volume overload secondary to heart failure.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including vasopressin for hypotension, ultrafiltration for fluid removal, diuretics for volume overload, and medications for her comorbidities such as AF and UC. She is also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

A follow-up scope may be necessary.

2. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is resistant to diuretic therapy and has gross fluid overload, leading to dilated right ventricle and worsening diastolic dysfunction. She is undergoing ultrafiltration in the CCU to remove excess fluid. The goal is to remove a net negative 4 liters of fluid today.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers,
   hct stable at 24 for over 24hrs, with baseline hct mid-upper 20s. Had
   multiple episodes of clots from rectum (Q15mins) overnight. Called GI
   and did NGL which was negative making UGIB less likely.  Transfused one
   unit pRBCs. Awaiting follow up Hct.
   - Hct Q2H

   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Still resistant to diureisis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically. As she did not improve over day today with lasix
   gtt at 30/hr she has been transferred to CCU for ultrafiltration to
   help with fluid removal.
   - On UF with net negative 500mL. Goal is net negative 4L today.
   - Will need A-line for better BP measurements as cuff not [**Location (un) 308**] well
   - Renal will continue to follow and leave recs for CVVH
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction
   - Will continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Will continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence
   this does improve diastolic CHF.
   # Diarrhea: Likely from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.
   - C Diff pending
   - Loperamide PRN if C diff negative
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension and has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 94.0°F, heart rate of 76 beats per minute with irregular rhythm, blood pressure in the 80s/60s mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented, and able to sit up without lightheadedness or dizziness.

Physical examination reveals anasarca, crackles in the left lower lung field, distended abdomen with mild right lower quadrant tenderness, and 4+ lower extremity peripheral edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 19.8 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormalities.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of GI bleeding, acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, post-percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO), hyponatremia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient is"

2. The patient has been placed on dialysis catheter and started ultrafiltration (UF) due to fluid overload and resistant diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers,
   hct stable at 24 for over 24hrs, with baseline hct mid-upper 20s. Had
   multiple episodes of clots from rectum (Q15mins) overnight. Called GI
   and did NGL which was negative making UGIB less likely.  Transfused one
   unit pRBCs. Awaiting follow up Hct.
   - Hct Q2H
   - GI to consult formally today. [**Month (only) 60**] need to rescope
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Still resistant to diureisis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically. As she did not improve over day today with lasix
   gtt at 30/hr she has been transferred to CCU for ultrafiltration to
   help with fluid removal.
   - On UF with net negative 500mL. Goal is net negative 4L today.
   - Will need A-line for better BP measurements as cuff not [**Location (un) 308**] well
   - Renal will continue to follow and leave recs for CVVH
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction
   - Will continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Will continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence
   this does improve diastolic CHF.
   # Diarrhea: Likely from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.
   - C Diff pending
   - Loperamide PRN if C diff negative
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - UF as above
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Continue aspirin at 81, off plavix due recent GI bleed and
   questionable necessity given no CVA from PFO.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely from volume overload due to heart failure.
   Suspect to improve if able to remove fluid via dialysis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a dialysis catheter, initiation of ultrafiltration (UF), and administration of vasopressin due to her blood pressure remaining in the 70s/30s. Despite these measures, her blood pressure has not improved significantly.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 33.7°C (92.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 84/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, able to sit up without lightheadedness or dizziness, but cannot follow up because of no previous urine output (due to acute renal failure).

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and has undergone clipping/injection of ulcers. She has experienced multiple episodes of frank bloody clots from the rectum, and a negative nasogastric lavage (NGL) suggests that upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is less likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers,
   hct stable at 24 for over 24hrs, with baseline hct mid-upper 20s. Had
   multiple episodes of clots from rectum (Q15mins) overnight. Called GI
   and did NGL which was negative making UGIB less likely.  Transfused one
   unit pRBCs. Awaiting follow up Hct.
   - Hct Q2H
   - GI to consult formally today. [**Month (only) 60**] need to rescope
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Still resistant to diureisis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically. As she did not improve over day today with lasix
   gtt at 30/hr she has been transferred to CCU for ultrafiltration to
   help with fluid removal.
   - On UF with net negative 500mL. Goal is net negative 4L today.
   - Will need A-line for better BP measurements as cuff not [**Location (un) 308**] well
   - Renal will continue to follow and leave recs for CVVH
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction
   - Will continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Will continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence
   this does improve diastolic CHF.
   # Diarrhea: Likely from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.
   - C Diff pending
   - Loperamide PRN if C diff negative
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - UF as above
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Continue aspirin at 81, off plavix due recent GI bleed and
   questionable necessity given no CVA from PFO.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely from volume overload due to heart failure.
   Suspect to improve if able to remove fluid via dialysis.
   - Trend lytes
   - 1000ml fluid restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure who was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and had a percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on 03/14/2108. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), atrial fibrillation, and hyponatremia.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/54-97/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is alert and oriented, with anasarca, breathing comfortably. Physical examination reveals crackles in the left lower lung field, distended mild right lower quadrant (RLQ) with no rebound or guarding, and lower extremity peripheral edema.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, increased creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low potassium, low magnesium, and normal liver function tests.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vas"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers,
   hct at 23.9 from 25 last night. Most likely precipitant for bleed is
   CHF. GI rec monitoring HCT and if this decreases they may go in again
   to evaluate. Will recheck HCT in 6 hrs. If lower then will call GI.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Ovenight there was a problem
   with UF machine and did not get fluid out. Continued on Vasopressing
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction. If needed will switch to
   phenyelphrine
   - Will continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Will continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence
   this does improve diastolic CHF.
   - continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - UF as above
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Right heart cath showed perfectly normal PVR under all conditions; as
   well as moderate pulmonary htn.  The entirety of her syndrome is
   therefore explained by chronic severe elevation of left atrial
   pressure, and NOT intrinsic pulmonarty parenchymal or vascular
   disease.  In the absence of mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and
   left ventricular contractile dysfunction (all of which she does not
   have), then the only explanation is severe diastolic dysfunction of the
   left ventricle, as I originally hypothesized.  She clearly does not
   have primary pulmonary hypertension, as her PVR is perfectly normal.
   For now we must continue to pursue aggressive volume unloading through
   hemofiltration.  Also need to keep heart rate in the lowish range with
   in Lopressor.  Will continue ranolazine for its possible lusitropic
   effect.
   Her severe tricuspid regurgitation is due to chronic right heart
   pressure and volume overload, which in turn is secondary to her extreme
   LV diastolic dysfunction, and not to any obvious abnormality of the
   valve itself.  Therefore, as I see it at this time, there can be no
   benefit to be derived from repair or replacement of the tricuspid
   valve, because to do so does not address the underlying cause of her TR
   or right heart failure, and could result in worsening of RV function
   (although it could be argued that worse RV function is acceptable if
   the forward RV stroke volume is increased and the regurgitant fraction
   is markedly reduced.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She has been admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, with a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and has undergone clipping/injection of ulcers. She is currently experiencing active LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleed), which is believed to be precipitated by CHF. The patient is being monitored closely for any changes in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) and may undergo further evaluation if there is a significant decrease.

The patient's cardiac status is a major concern. She has acute decompensated diastolic failure, as evidenced by elevated right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) pressures on the right heart catheterization. However, there are no elevated pulmonary pressures, making idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unlikely. The patient is receiving vasopressin for hypotension, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 64. She is also on beta-blockers for heart rate control and to prevent worsening of diastolic dysfunction. Ranolazine is being continued for its potential beneficial effects on diastolic CHF.

The patient also has chronic renal failure, with creatinine levels trending upwards. This is likely secondary to poor forward flow from heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic HF admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and underwent percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and unsuccessful ultrafiltration due to a malfunctioning machine. She continues to have ongoing LGIB and requires ongoing monitoring of HCT.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction may worsen due to tachycardia, leading to further compromise in cardiac output.
2. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's renal function continues to deteriorate, and there is a concern for ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) if renal perfusion does not improve.
3. GI bleeding: Although the patient's current GI bleeding appears stable, there is a risk of re-bleeding or progression of the current bleed.
4. Volume overload: The patient's ongoing volume overload increases the risk of further cardiac complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing management with vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's medical history"

Neurological examination shows appropriate alertness and orientation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF. GI on board, rec monitoring
   HCT and if this decreases they may go in again to evaluate, however
   unlikely.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Ovenight there was a problem
   with UF machine and did not get fluid out. Continued on Vasopressing
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.  Will add phenylephrine today.
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Will check CI today and trend.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Continue aspirin at 81, off plavix due recent GI bleed and
   questionable necessity given no CVA from PFO.
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), and a percutaneous puncture occlusion (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen with very active LGIB overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction is worsening, as evidenced by elevated right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) pressures. This can lead to further pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GI Bleed): The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and has experienced GI bleeding. There is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding, which could necessitate additional interventions.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic persistent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF. GI on board, rec monitoring
   HCT and if this decreases they may go in again to evaluate, however
   unlikely.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Ovenight there was a problem
   with UF machine and did not get fluid out. Continued on Vasopressing
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.  Will add phenylephrine today.
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Will check CI today and trend.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Continue aspirin at 81, off plavix due recent GI bleed and
   questionable necessity given no CVA from PFO.
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure.
- She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension.
- The patient has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a perforated foreign object (PFO) repair with endovascular device.
- She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen with very active lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) overnight.
- The patient is currently experiencing acute decompensated diastolic failure, leukocytosis, chronic renal failure, and GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. This could be a sign of occult sepsis, especially considering her prolonged hospital stay and hypotension. Further investigations such as urinalysis, blood culture, chest X-ray, and treatment with antibiotics if necessary should be considered.
2. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's elevated right and left ventricular pressures indicate diastolic dysfunction. She is currently being treated with vasopressin and phenyle"

   Ultrafiltration is going well.  She has an elevated wbc and low
   systemic vascular resistance although no obvious infectious focus.  We
   will check cxr, bld and urine cultures.  No abx for now.
   I remain puzzled by her hemodynamics.  If her cardiac index is normal
   or supranormal, then why should she require ultrafiltration for volume
   regulation in the presence of presumably intact kidneys?
   For now, we will continue ranolazine for diastolic function, beta
   blocker to moderate heart rate, ultrafiltration (aggressive) to volume
   unload, ppi for ulcers.  Prognosis is uncertain at this time.  I am
   hoping that by aggressively volume unloading, her right heart will
   shrink down, the tricuspid regurgitation decrease, and her tendency for
   fluid avidity be reduced.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve (PFO) repair. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. 

The patient's current condition includes acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, GI bleeding, and leukocytosis. She is being treated with vasopressin, phenylephrine, beta-blockers, ranolazine, fluid restriction, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for fluid overload and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Occult sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, which raises concern for occult sepsis, especially considering her prolonged hospital course and hypotension. Further investigations, such as urine analysis, blood cultures, and a chest X-ray, will be done to evaluate for infection. Antibiotics may be initiated if necessary.
2. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has elevated right and left ventricular pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. She will continue on vasopressin with aggressive fluid removal"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the repair of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device.

The patient is currently in the cardiac care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. She has an active lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) and is being monitored closely with regular checks on hemoglobin concentration. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there are concerns for occult sepsis. A PA line culture grew gram-negative rods, so she will start on gentamicin after consulting with the infectious disease specialist. Antibiotics may be changed based on the species identification.

The patient's acute decompensated diastolic failure is being managed with vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 64, aggressive fluid removal through ultrafiltration, and continued diuretic therapy. Phenylephrine is being uptitrated to support blood pressure during diuresis. Metoprolol is being increased for heart rate control due to the risk of worsening diastolic dysfunction from tachycardia.

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement.

The patient's current medical complications include leukocytosis with a possible occult sepsis, complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and peripheral arterial disease.

The patient is currently being treated with various medications such as vasopressin, phenylephrine, metoprolol, ranolazine, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and ferrous sulfate. She is also undergoing ultrafiltration for volume overload and has a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement.

Further assessments and plans include treating the leukocytosis with antibiotics, discontinuing the PA catheter, continuing aggressive diuresis for diastolic failure, tailoring the antibiotic regimen based on culture results, and monitoring the patient's response to treatment."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has been experiencing a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a percutaneous puncture and occlusion device (PFO) repair.

The patient's current condition includes leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.2 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. There is concern for occult sepsis, especially given her prolonged hospital stay and hypotension. A peripheral arterial line culture grew gram-negative rods, so she will be started on cefepime and levofoxacin, and antibiotic therapy will be tailored based on the speciation.

The patient continues to have acute decompensated diastolic failure, as evidenced by elevated right and left ventricular pressures shown by a right heart catheterization. She is being treated with vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 64, and aggressive fluid removal with ultrafiltration (UF) is ongoing. Phenylephrine will be uptitrated as necessary to support aggressive diuresis.

The patient also has chronic renal failure stage III with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. The renal failure is likely secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure. Aggressive di"

   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Continued on Vasopressin
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   - goal fluid balance negative 3-4Liters today with UF
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.
   - Continue Phenylephrine. Will uptitrate as necessary so that can
   continue aggressive diuresis
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Will check CI today and trend.

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient's current condition includes acute decompensated diastolic failure, acute kidney injury (ARF) stage III chronic renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
- Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm), with atrial fibrillation
- Blood pressure: 107/25 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 inspiratory breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula
- Pulmonary artery pressures: (50 mmHg) / (30 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 162 K/uL (normal range: 4.6-11.9 K/uL)
- Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
- Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
- Glucose: 108 mg/dL

- Calcium: 10.4 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
- Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL
- Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
- LDH: 184 IU/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General: Alert, NAD (nothing abnormal detected), anasarca (generalized swelling), breathing comfortably
- HEENT: Normocephalic (head size within normal range), atraumatic (no evidence of trauma), no scleral icterus (yellowing of the white part of the eyes), MMM (mouth, mouth mucosa)
- CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular (irregular heartbeat), no murmurs (abnormal heart sounds), JVP (jugular venous pressure) >15cm
- LUNGS: Crackles in left lower lobe (LLL), rest clear to auscultation (listening to lung sounds)
- ABDOMEN: NABS (no abnormal bowel sounds), distended mild right lower quadrant (RLQ), tenderness without rebound or guarding
- EXTREMITIES: 4+ lower extremity peripheral edema (swelling in the legs), 2+ left upper extremity (LUE) edema, 2+ right upper extremity (RUE) edema, 2+ radial pulses with 3-second capillary refill, lower extremities warm
- NEURO: Alert and oriented to time, place, and person, appropriate
- PSYCH: Listens and responds appropriately, pleasant

The patient's medical and family history includes severe diastolic CHF, right-sided systolic HF, hypoxia, diarrhea, hypotension, PFO repair with endovascular device, and long hospital course.

The patient's potential medical complications include leukocytosis, acute decompensated diastolic failure, ARF stage III chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and volume overload. The patient's current treatment plan includes ultrafiltration, vasopressin for hypotension, aggressive diuretic regimen, and renal dosing of medications."

   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   #. Leukocytosis: Concerned for occult sepsis given prolonged hospital
   course and hypotension. PA line cx GNR

   - Continue to trend white count

   #. UTI: Complicated. CiproX14 days. Last dose [**2108-4-9**].
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated

   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Continued on Vasopressin
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   - negative 3-4Liters today with UF
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.
   - Continue Phenylephrine. Will uptitrate as necessary so that can
   continue aggressive diuresis
   - Increase beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - replace a-line
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down possibly
   as result of better forward flow. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an occult infection. Given her prolonged hospital course and hypotension, there is concern for sepsis. The patient's peripheral arterial line culture grew gram-negative rods, so she will be started on gentamicin after consultation with the infectious disease specialist. Antibiotic therapy may be adjusted based on culture results, possibly including aztreonam if available.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a complicated UTI, for which she received ciprofloxacin for 14 days. The last dose was administered on [**2108-4-9**].
3. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient's right and left ventricular pressures are elevated, but pulmonary pressures are not elevated, making idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unlikely. She is continuing on vasopressin to"

   TTE: A well-seated septal occluder device is seen across the
   interatrial septum. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   leaflets are thin/mobile, but fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe
   [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior TTE study (images reviewed) of [**2108-3-22**], the
   findings are similar.
   CXR [**2108-3-25**] Final Read: IMPRESSION: Increased retrocardiac density which
   could be pneumonia.

   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.

   #. UTI: GNRs in UCx. On Cipro/Aztreonam.
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). TTE shows severe TR and RHF.
   LVEF wnl. Net negative over17L for LOS in CCU. Still with severe volume
   overload, however, so will continue to need aggressive fluid removal.
   - goal fluid balance negative 4Liters today with UF

   continue aggressive diuresis
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a previous PFO repair with endovascular device placement. The patient has severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right-sided systolic heart failure. She underwent an endovascular device placement for PFO repair and was transferred to the CCU for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with growth of GNR from the PA line and GPC from the a-line. She was treated with Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro (day 2) and the lines were removed. Blood cultures will be followed up for bacteremia, C. difficile, and sensitivities.
2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection with GNRs in the urine culture. She is being treated with Cipro/Aztreonam.
3. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has severe diastolic failure with elevated right and left ventricular pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits. The patient requires aggressive fluid removal due to severe volume overload.
4. ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with an increasing creatinine level. It is likely secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure. Aggressive diuresis and ultrafiltration are planned.
5. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and has had GI bleeding. Most likely precipitant for the bleed is congestive heart failure. The patient will continue to be monitored for further bleeding episodes.
6. PFO repair with endovascular device: The patient underwent a PFO repair with endovascular device placement. She will require close monitoring for any complications related to the device.
7. Fluid overload: The patient has ongoing fluid overload, which needs to be managed aggressively through ultrafiltration and diuretics.
8. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressin and phenylephrine infusion for hemodynamic support.
9. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has diastolic dysfunction and will require beta-blocker therapy for rate control and ranolazine for diastolic function improvement.
10. Chronic renal failure: The patient has stage III chronic renal failure. Renal dosing of medications and avoiding nephrotoxins are necessary. Dialysis may be required if electrolyte imbalances worsen.

   TTE: A well-seated septal occluder device is seen across the
   interatrial septum. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   leaflets are thin/mobile, but fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe
   [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior TTE study (images reviewed) of [**2108-3-22**], the
   findings are similar.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a previously repaired patent foramen ovale with an endovascular device. She was transferred to the critical care unit for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in her blood cultures. She is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by GNRs in her urinary catheter. She is currently on ciprofloxacin and aztreonam.
3. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF), with elevated right and left ventricular pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. This makes the concern for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unlikely.

   TTE: A well-seated septal occluder device is seen across the
   interatrial septum. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   leaflets are thin/mobile, but fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe
   [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior TTE study (images reviewed) of [**2108-3-22**], the
   findings are similar.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a previously repaired patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR) from both peripheral arterial (PA) and arterial lines. She received antibiotics (Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro) and the lines were removed.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a UTI caused by GNRs in her urinary catheter (UCx). She was treated with antibiotics (Cipro/Aztreonam).
3. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient has acute decompensated diastolic failure with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits. There is no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has stage III chronic renal failure with worsening renal function. She is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and ultrafiltration (UF).
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently stable, but requires ongoing management.
6. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO): The patient had a PFO repair with an endovascular device.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient continues to have volume overload despite ultrafiltration. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 4 liters today.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite vasopressor support with vasopressin and phenylephrine. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 60.
3. Diuretic Therapy: The patient is on an aggressive diuretic regimen.
4. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is being monitored closely, and if there is no urine output, chronic dialysis may be considered.
5. Gastrointestinal Management: The patient requires continued prophylaxis for stress ulcers and consideration for changing to oral proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) when more stable. Ferrous sulfate is provided for iron supplementation.
6. Electrolyte Management: The patient's electrolytes are managed through CVVH.
7. Code Status: The patient has confirmed full code status.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and there may be additional details or complexities in the patient's case."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   #. Leukocytosis: Concerned for occult sepsis given prolonged hospital
   course and hypotension.
   -          Will check U/A, Bcx, Ucx, cxr, and C.Diff
   -          Will treat with abx if necessary
   -          Continue to trend white count
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Continued on Vasopressin
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   - goal fluid balance negative 3-4Liters today with UF
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.
   - Continue Phenylephrine. Will uptitrate as necessary so that can
   continue aggressive diuresis
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Will check CI today and trend.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down possibly
   as result of better forward flow. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not
   suggestive of ATN
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF. GI on board, rec monitoring
   HCT and if this decreases they may go in again to evaluate, however
   unlikely now that venous pressures are decreased.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (HF) admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated septal occluder device (PFO) repair.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Occult sepsis: The patient's prolonged hospital course and hypotension raise concerns for occult sepsis. Leukocytosis is present, and further investigations such as urine analysis (U/A), blood culture (Bcx), urine culture (Ucx), chest X-ray (CXR), and Clostridium difficile testing will be performed to rule out infection. Antibiotics will be initiated if necessary.

2. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction is worsening, as evidenced by elevated right and left ventricular pressures on right heart catheterization. Vasopressin will be continued for hypotension, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 64. Aggressive fluid removal through ultrafiltration (UF) will be continued to achieve a negative fluid balance of 3-4 liters today. Phenylephrine will be uptitrated to maintain adequate systemic vascular resistance and allow for aggressive diuresis"

   TTE: A well-seated septal occluder device is seen across the
   interatrial septum. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   leaflets are thin/mobile, but fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe
   [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   I anticipate the need for 24 to 48 h more ultrafiltration at the
   present rate of volume unloading.  The major question is whether her
   kidneys will work once ultrafiltration is discontinued.  I am beginning
   to suspect that her systemic vasodilatation, presumably secondary to
   sepsis, may be shunting blood flow away from kidneys.  Therefore, I
   would now like to be more aggressive in supporting blood pressure with
   vasopressin (already maxed) and phenylephrine.  We will now maintain
   sbp > 100 mmHg and mean arterial pressure > 60 mmHg.  Otherwise will
   continue aggressive volume unloading, heart rate control, ranolazine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (RHF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: Blood cultures from the pulmonary artery (PA) line grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), and from the arterial line (A-line) grew Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient is on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): GNRs were found in the urine culture, and the patient is on ciprofloxacin and aztreonam.
3. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has elevated right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF).
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending down with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)/ultrafiltration (UF). She is still experiencing low urine output.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and has had previous episodes of GI bleeding. The most likely precipitant for this bleed is CHF. She is stable, and her current management includes intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and ferrous sulfate for transfusion.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has been experiencing ongoing fluid overload, and her fluid balance is negative.
7. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, and her mean arterial pressure (MAP) is below 60 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of bacteremia and UTI, there is a risk of sepsis.
2. Worsening renal function: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate despite CVVH/UF.
3. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UC and previous episodes of GI bleeding put her at risk for further bleeding events.
4. Right ventricular failure: The severe TR and RHF seen on TTE indicate ongoing right-sided heart dysfunction, which may lead to further decompensation.
5. Infection control: With multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Cardiogenic shock: The combination of severe TR, RHF, and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a previous procedure for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient's current condition includes bacteremia/sepsis caused by Serratia marcescens, which is sensitive to certain antibiotics but resistant to others. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by gram-negative rods, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin and aztreonam. The patient's acute decompensated diastolic failure is being managed with ultrafiltration, vasopressin, and phenylephrine to maintain fluid balance and blood pressure. She also has chronic renal failure, and efforts are being made to improve urine output through aggressive diuretic therapy and consideration of chronic dialysis if needed.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is believed to be precipitated by CHF. She is receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and is being considered for conversion to oral PPI when more stable. The patient's electrolyte levels are being managed through continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and fluid restriction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, PFO repair with an endovascular device, and transfer from the cardiology floor to the CCU for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: Blood cultures from the peripheral line grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), and from the arterial line grew Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has GNRs in the urine culture and is being treated with ciprofloxacin and aztreonam.
3. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). She is being managed with ultrafiltration, vasopressin, and phenylephrine for hypotension, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has stage III chronic renal failure, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, renal failure, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a significant medical history including gastrointestinal bleed, allergies to certain medications, and shellfish. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/61 mmHg to 125/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving vasopressin, calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, and potassium chloride infusions as part of their ICU treatment. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes, along with low hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, acute renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and a history of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and catheters in place.

Potential Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure may lead to further decompensation, resulting in increased fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The"

   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.

   - Consider ID consult for antibiotic regimen given limited supply of
   aztreonam and multiple allergies to other medications to treat GNRs.
   - Cotinue Vanc with dosing per level. Today was 14.7 so can give
   another dose and recheck level prior to next dose.

   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). TTE shows severe TR and RHF.
   LVEF wnl. Net negative over17L for LOS in CCU with exam consistent with
   less volume overload.
   - Unfortunately, requiring more pressors to continue to get fluids off
   so may need to back off UF goal today
   - Decreased BPs may also be from increasing the beta blocker although
   this would have had a very small effect on BP and may actually increase
   her CO/BP by decreasing her HR. Will discuss with attending.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. MAP 60.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down with
   CVVH/UF. Still low U/O.
   - Now that foley out consider bladder scan if UOP continues to be poor.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - Renal is following
   - Will recheck urine lytes.
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a repaired patent foramen ovale (PFO). She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

The patient's current medical conditions include bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, and GI bleeding. She is currently receiving multiple medications for her conditions, including vasopressin, phenylephrine, vancomycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, ranolazine, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia/sepsis is caused by Serratia Marcescens, which is sensitive to certain antibiotics but not to others. It is crucial to monitor her vital signs and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. UTI: The patient has a GNR infection in her urine culture. She is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin and aztreonam. Awaiting sensitivity results to aztreonam but sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down with

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, and has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and repair of patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device.

She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 90/43 mmHg to 63/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including bacteremia/sepsis caused by Serratia marcescens, which is resistant to certain antibiotics, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) sensitive to ciprofloxacin and awaiting sensitivities to aztreonam. She also has acute decompensated diastolic failure with elevated right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures, as well as severe tricuspid reg"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro (day 3).
   Lines d/c
   - Will f/u Bcx, C.diff and sensitivities on blood cultures/urine
   cultures
   - Continue to trend white count
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - Consider ID consult for antibiotic regimen given limited supply of
   aztreonam and multiple allergies to other medications to treat GNRs.
   - Cotinue Vanc with dosing per level. Today was 14.7 so can give
   another dose and recheck level prior to next dose.
   # UTI: GNRs in UCx. On Cipro/Aztreonam. Awaiting sensitivities to
   aztreonam but sensitive to cipro
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). TTE shows severe TR and RHF.
   LVEF wnl. Net negative over17L for LOS in CCU with exam consistent with
   less volume overload.
   - Unfortunately, requiring more pressors to continue to get fluids off
   so may need to back off UF goal today
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Add milrinone for better relaxation. Keep BPs up with pressors.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down with
   CVVH/UF. Still low U/O.
   - Now that foley out consider bladder scan if UOP continues to be poor.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - Renal is following
   - Will recheck urine lytes.
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated foreign object (PFO) repair with endovascular device.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is resistant to cephalosporins, tobramycin, and meropenem. She is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending sensitivity results.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection with gram-negative rods (GNRs) in her urine culture. She is currently on ciprofloxacin and aztreonam, awaiting sensitivity results.
3. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF) with elevated right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) pressures. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure with a rising"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro (day 3).
   Lines d/c
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in UCx. On Cipro/Aztreonam. Awaiting sensitivities to
   aztreonam but sensitive to cipro. #2 GNR speciation pending.
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down with
   CVVH/UF. Still low U/O.
   - Now that foley out consider bladder scan if UOP continues to be poor.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - Renal is following
   - Will recheck urine lytes.
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, and other medical conditions. He presented to the ICU with bacteremia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and chronic heart failure. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications and interventions, including vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains hemodynamically unstable with persistent hypotension. Fluid balance shows significant ongoing losses, likely due to renal losses and ongoing bleeding. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable without any supplemental oxygen required. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's overall condition is critical, and he continues to be closely monitored and managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and altered mental status suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure and ongoing fluid losses put him at risk for further deterioration in kidney function, leading to AKI.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's chronic heart failure and ongoing hypotension despite vasopressor support, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and poor outcomes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She has been admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, with a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and repair of patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device.

The patient has been transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. She is currently on vasopressin and phenylephrine to support blood pressure during aggressive diuresis. 

She has a history of bacteremia/sepsis, with cultures growing sensitive organisms such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotics have been changed accordingly.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Serratia and Enterobacter, for which she is currently receiving ciprofloxacin and aztreonam. However, aztreonam will be discontinued as both organisms are sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

She has acute decompensated diastolic failure with severe tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure, but normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). She has experienced a negative fluid balance of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a peritoneal flap repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures from the peripheral arterial line grew Serratia Marcescens, which is resistant to cefalosporins, tobramycin, and meropenem. She is awaiting sensitivity to aztreonam. From the arterial line, GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) were also grown. The patient is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine cultures showed GNRs (Gram-negative rods). She is on ciprofloxacin and aztreonam, awaiting sensitivities to aztreonam but sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Another GNR speciation is pending.
3. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient's right"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She has been admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, with a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated femoral occluder (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and continued hypotension. She has been transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), and lactate acid. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range. Other lab values indicate possible liver dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and abnormal kidney function.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is pan-sensitive. Urine culture also grew Serratia and Enterobacter, both of which are pan-sensitive. The patient is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin. Consider discontinuing aztreon"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP has been poor on her own without diuretics or UF overnight. Two
   options to increase UOP and lower CVP include: start lasix this am and
   see if has better UOP and 2 start CVVH again.
   - Creatinine rising off UF and on higher doses of pressors so may not
   respond to lasix however would lean toward trying lasix before
   re-starting CVVH as if she responds to the diuretic we may save her
   long-term dialysis.
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis

   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's medical course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a previous procedure for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure, elevated central venous pressure (CVP), and decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) suggest cardiogenic shock. The CVP has improved since stopping ultrafiltration and holding diuretics, indicating that the shock is likely cardiogenic rather than septic.

2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and poor urine output suggest worsening renal failure. This may be due to the patient's poor cardiac output (CO), higher doses of pressors, or fluid overload.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and has undergone clipping/injection of ulcers. The most likely precipitant for the GI bleeding is the patient's CHF. The patient's hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of ulcerative colitis (UC). She underwent a percutaneous femoral arterial catheterization (PFO) repair with an endovascular device and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and high central venous pressure (CVP) suggest cardiogenic shock, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal failure. This can lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of UC and recent gastrointestinal bleeding increases her risk of further bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent re-bleeding.
4. Infection: The presence of multiple infections, including bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), requires prompt identification and treatment to prevent further complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the key points:

- The patient has a history of gastro intestinal bleeding (GIB) and chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF).
- He presented to the hospital with altered mental status, which was not delirium, and is now in the ICU.
- The patient has a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of 71%, indicating possible cardiogenic shock.
- He is currently on vasopressin and phenylephrine infusions, suggesting ongoing hypotension and need for vasoconstrictor support.
- The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is low at 45 mmHg, making it difficult to wean off pressors.
- His heart rate (HR) is increased in the 80s-90s bpm range, which may be compensatory due to hypotension.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and a decreased urine output of 15 cc/hr.
- The patient also has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to poor perfusion or pressure ulcers.
- There are signs of bacteremia, possibly secondary to his GIB or other sources.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes ("

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro (day 3).
   Lines d/c
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in UCx. On Cipro/Aztreonam. Awaiting sensitivities to
   aztreonam but sensitive to cipro. #2 GNR speciation pending.
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down with
   CVVH/UF. Still low U/O.
   - Now that foley out consider bladder scan if UOP continues to be poor.
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - Renal is following
   - Will recheck urine lytes.
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and repair of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device.

The patient has been in the ICU and received ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. She has multiple medical complications, including bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and fluid/electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bacteremia/sepsis: The patient has grown Serratia marcescens sensitive only to aztreonam, awaiting sensitivity results. She is currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin.
2. UTI: The patient has GNRs in her urine culture and is on ciprofloxacin and aztreonam.
3. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits. She is currently on"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP has been poor on her own without diuretics or UF overnight. Two
   options to increase UOP and lower CVP include: start lasix this am and
   see if has better UOP and 2 start CVVH again.
   - Creatinine rising off UF and on higher doses of pressors so may not
   respond to lasix however would lean toward trying lasix before
   re-starting CVVH as if she responds to the diuretic we may save her
   long-term dialysis.
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 5).
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output after lasix  today will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a previous procedure for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

Current Assessment:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to her low mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) and elevated central venous pressure (CVP).
2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is resistant to certain antibiotics. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by Gram-negative rods, which are sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Aztreonam has been discontinued.
4. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient's right heart catheterization shows elevated right and left ventricular pressures, but no elevated pulmonary pressures. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reveals severe tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits.
5. Acute Kid"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP has been poor on her own without diuretics or UF overnight. Two
   options to increase UOP and lower CVP include: start lasix this am and
   see if has better UOP and 2 start CVVH again.
   - Creatinine rising off UF and on higher doses of pressors so may not
   respond to lasix however would lean toward trying lasix before
   re-starting CVVH as if she responds to the diuretic we may save her
   long-term dialysis.
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 5).
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a previous pulmonary-foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by a low mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) and elevated central venous pressure (CVP). This suggests that her heart's ability to pump blood efficiently is compromised.

2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is resistant to certain antibiotics. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Sensitivity results for blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.

3. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF). Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal limits. The patient's diastolic dysfunction is being managed with"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP has been poor on her own without diuretics or UF overnight. Two
   options to increase UOP and lower CVP include: start lasix this am and
   see if has better UOP and 2 start CVVH again.
   - Creatinine rising off UF and on higher doses of pressors so may not
   respond to lasix however would lean toward trying lasix before
   re-starting CVVH as if she responds to the diuretic we may save her
   long-term dialysis.
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   - Change to po meds, (devcrease po fluids), consider albumin as a
   temporizing measure to increase effective circ volume while wheaning
   phenylephrine.
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 5).
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure (RHF). She has been admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, and her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a perforated prosthetic occluder (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute decompensated diastolic failure, and chronic renal failure (stage III). She also has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and is experiencing GI bleeding, which is believed to be precipitated by CHF.

The assessment and plan include several interventions such as starting lasix to increase urine output and lower central venous pressure (CVP), restarting continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), weaning off vasopressors, changing to oral medications, considering albumin administration, and managing GI bleeding with intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and ferrous sulfate.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening cardiogenic shock, progression of bacteremia/sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, and ongoing GI bleeding. It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She underwent a percutaneous femoral artery puncture (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic shock due to severe diastolic CHF and right-sided systolic HF. This is supported by the low blood pressure (BP), poor urine output (UOP), and elevated central venous pressure (CVP). The current plan involves trying lasix to improve UOP and lower CVP before restarting continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).
2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is resistant to certain antibiotics. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Sensitivity results for blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient's lines and catheters will be maintained for therapeutic necessity, and Foley catheter will be discontinued.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a UTI caused by"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP stable around 10-15cc/hr, goal 20cc/hr
   - If UOP does not increase throughout the day, will consider starting
   lasix drip
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans pan
   sensitive. a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 6).
   - PA, A line and dialysis lines out
   - foley replaced
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am, has been supratherapeutic
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension, started
   midodrine yesterday in attempt to wean pressors. Try to wean down
   pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP: [**Name (NI) 831**] ([**0-0-**])

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated femoral osteomyelitis (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for several medical conditions. These include cardiogenic shock, bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute decompensated diastolic failure, chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and femoral osteomyelitis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate 75 bpm, blood pressure 101/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is evidence of chronic renal failure.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, warm skin, and 3+ pitting edema. Neurological examination shows that the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP stable around 10-15cc/hr, goal 20cc/hr
   - If UOP does not increase throughout the day, will consider starting
   lasix drip
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans pan
   sensitive. a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 6).
   - PA, A line and dialysis lines out
   - foley replaced
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am, has been supratherapeutic
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension, started
   midodrine yesterday in attempt to wean pressors. Try to wean down
   pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a percutaneous femoral occluder (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic shock due to her severe diastolic CHF. This is suggested by a mixed oxygen consumption (MVO2) of 71%, indicating cardiogenic shock rather than septic shock. The central venous pressure (CVP) has also increased to 12-4 mmHg after stopping ultrafiltration and holding diuretics.
2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens pan-sensitive organisms. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection with GNRs in urine cultures, both species sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Aztreonam has been discontinued.
4. Acute Decompensated Diastolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   -UOP has been poor on her own without diuretics or UF overnight. Two
   options to increase UOP and lower CVP include: start lasix this am and
   see if has better UOP and 2 start CVVH again.
   - Creatinine rising off UF and on higher doses of pressors so may not
   respond to lasix however would lean toward trying lasix before
   re-starting CVVH as if she responds to the diuretic we may save her
   long-term dialysis.
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   - Change to po meds, (devcrease po fluids), consider albumin as a
   temporizing measure to increase effective circ volume while wheaning
   phenylephrine.
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans S to
   cefalosporins, tobramycin, meropenem, imi. Awaiting sensitivity to
   aztreonam. From a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 5).
   - sensitivities on blood cultures/urine cultures
   - PA, A line out. Keeping dialysis catheter for it therapeutic
   necessity (daily BCx from dialysis line)
   - Foley D/C
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check vanc in am
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension. Try to wean
   down pressors with goal MAP 60.
   - Milrinone resulted in tachycardia and decrease in BP, thus it was
   stopped.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP: [**Name (NI) 831**] ([**0-0-**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes a past procedure for patent foramen ovale repair with an endovascular device, and she has been experiencing a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and shock.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 58/32 mmHg to 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.7 kg at admission to 69.8 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, low platelet count, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, such as low potassium, high sodium, and normal levels of calcium and magnesium. Additionally, there are elevated levels of lactate acid, lactic acid, and LDH.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including:

1. Shock: The patient's mean oxygen consumption (MVO2) is 71%, suggesting"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She has been admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, with a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a previous procedure for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by a low cardiac output (MVO2 71%) and a high central venous pressure (CVP) of 12-4. This suggests that her heart's pumping ability is compromised.

2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin but has been holding doses due to supratherapeutic levels of vancomycin.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by Gram-negative rods (GNRs), both species sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Aztreonam was discontinued.

4. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF), with preserved left ventricular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a perforated septal atrial communication (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. 

The patient was transferred from the cardiology floor to the CCU for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output (UOP) on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and PFO repair with an endovascular device.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's CVP is elevated, and she is experiencing hypotension, indicating the possibility of cardiogenic shock. This could be due to her severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF.

2. Worsening renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels and the need for chronic dialysis if there is no urine output.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of UC and has experienced GI bleeding. It is likely that the precipitant for the bleed is her CHF. She requires continued IV PPI and may need to switch to PO when more stable. Transfusion may be necessary for a low hct.

4. Hyponatremia, hypervolemic: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely due to her CHF. It is important to monitor her sodium levels and correct if necessary.

5. Infection/sepsis: The patient has bacteremia/sepsis with BCx from pa-line growing S"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure (RHF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a perforated femoral artery (PFO) repair with endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, indicated by low blood pressure, poor cardiac output, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP). This is likely due to severe diastolic CHF and RHF. Measures are being taken to optimize fluid balance, improve urine output, and wean off pressors.
2. Bacteremia/sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by Serratia marcescens pan-sensitive and GPCs. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic levels will be monitored, and the foley catheter has been replaced.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI with GNRs sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Aztreonam has been discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the repair of a patent foramen ovale with an endovascular device. She was transferred to the critical care unit for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 77 bpm (69-99 bpm), blood pressure of 95/45 mmHg (83/23-122/73 mmHg), respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (10-21 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 99%, and atrial fibrillation as her heart rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.7 kg at admission to 69.8 kg currently.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg (-1-14 mmHg), with a total fluid intake of 981 mL, output of 480 mL, and a balance of 501 mL (-145 mL). She is receiving respiratory support with an SpO2 of 99% and an ABG of ///23/.

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated femoral artery (PFO) repair with endovascular device placement.

The patient has been transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. She is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 and low urine output. The medical team is attempting to wean off the neo-gtt and consider starting lasix drip if the urine output does not increase throughout the day.

The patient has bacteremia/sepsis caused by Serratia marcescens, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. The medical team is also treating a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin.

The patient has acute decompensated diastolic failure with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and right heart failure (RHF). Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is within normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Shock: MVO2 71% so more likely cardiogenic than septic although could
   have mixed picture with multiple infections. Also CVP now up to [**12-4**]
   after stopping UF and holding diuretics suggesting cardiogenic shock.
   - UOP stable around 10-15cc/hr, goal 20cc/hr; weaning neo ggt
   - If UOP does not increase throughout the day, will consider starting
   lasix drip
   - Do not want to give IVF given that she has been so fluid overloaded
   and will worsen her cardiogenic shock
   - Will attempt to wean pressors as able if CO improves with diuresis
   # Bacteremia/sepsis: BCx from pa-line grew Seratia Marcesans pan
   sensitive. a-line grew GPCs. On Vanc /Cipro (day 7).
   - PA, A line and dialysis lines out
   - foley replaced
   - appreciate ID recs
   - vanc level of 16, will dose to keep levels 15-20
   # UTI: GNRs in Ucx both species sensitive to cipro. D/C
d aztreonam
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures. TTE shows severe
   TR and RHF. LVEF wnl. Net negative over 17L for LOS in CCU with exam
   consistent with less volume overload.
   - Continue vasopressin and Phenylephrine for hypotension, started
   midodrine in attempt to wean pressors. Try to wean down pressors with
   goal MAP 60.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # Hyponatremia, hypervolemic: stable today; no neurologic deficit. Most
   likely [**1-23**] CHF. Will continue to monitor. Should improve with further
   diuresis. Limiting ivf intake, but encourging po since this should
   improve albumin, and Improve oncotic pressure to aide in diuresis.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending up since CVVH
   stopped and pressors increased. As above CVP also elevated and unclear
   if renal failure from poor CO vs large pressor requirement vs d/cing
   UF.
   - Renal is following
   - if no urine output will consider chronic dialysis
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF.
   - Hct slightly down from prior but suspect dilutional since less
   negative today than prior days and hct dropped in proportion.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] and consider changing to PO when more stable,
   ferrous sulfate
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes->per CVVH, N->HH,low salt, fluid
   restriction
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2108-3-22**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP: [**Name (NI) 831**] ([**0-0-**])
   # DISPOSITION: CCU while on pressors

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (HFrEF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a perforated femoral artery (PFO) repair with endovascular device placement.

She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) for ultrafiltration after failing to increase urine output on an aggressive diuretic regimen. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as indicated by a low cardiac output (MVO2 71%) and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12.

The plan is to continue weaning off neo-gtt and start a lasix drip if urine output does not increase throughout the day. IV fluids will be restricted, and pressors will be weaned as able if cardiac output improves with diuresis. The patient has bacteremia/sepsis, with bacteria sensitive to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. She is on both medications.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Gram-negative rods sensitive to ciprofloxacin, for which aztreonam has been discontinued. She has acute decompensated diastolic failure, with right heart catheterization showing elevated right ventricular"
