   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Acetaminophen overdose, likely fulminant hepatic failure;
   significant likelihood that she will need liver transplant for survival
   - hepatology consult
   - transplant surgery consult
   - transplant SW
   - ethics consult for HIV testing (for transplant evaluation)
   - hepatitis serologies to be run in AM
   - serial neuro exams; neurosurgery consult for intracranial pressure
   monitoring if signs of neurologic changes

   - N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion
   - toxicology aware of patient; recommended checking daily acetaminophen
   levels
   - q6h INR, electrolyes, CBC
   - q12h LFTs
   - q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been wnl
   - RUQ ultrasound to assess portal vein patency/anatomy
   .
   ## Metabolic acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure
   - hyperventillation and bicarbonate drip for correction
   - acetazolamide if evidence of increased intracranial pressure
   - q6h ABGs
   .
   ## s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia
   - magnesium sulfate drip to keep level 4.8 to 8.4 per OB curbside.
   Currently at 9.6; will hold magnesium for now
   - Reflexes have been very difficult to test, even prior to starting mag
   .
   ## Hypothermia: possibly due to C-section
   - check blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture
   - warming blankets
   .
   ## Depression:
   - psychiatry eval when medically stabilized
   .
   ## FEN: NPO; trend lytes as above
   ## Access: PIV x2; A-line placed
   ## Communication: mother [**Name (NI) 359**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 360**]), [**Name2 (NI) 361**]er [**Name (NI) 362**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, which was attempted as a suicide. She also underwent an emergent Caesarian section this morning due to pre-eclampsia. 

The plan includes hepatology and transplant surgery consults, as well as transplant social work and ethics consult for HIV testing (for transplant evaluation). Hepatitis serologies will be run in the morning, along with serial neuro exams and a neurosurgery consult for intracranial pressure monitoring if there are any signs of neurological changes. A head CT has been ordered to check for evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion is being given, and daily acetaminophen levels are recommended. 

The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute hepatic failure. Hyperventilation and bicarbonate drip will be used for correction, and acetazolamide may be given if there is increased intracranial pressure. ABGs will be checked every 6 hours.

The patient's recent C-section was complicated by likely pre-eclampsia, and she is currently on a magnesium sulfate drip to keep the level between 4.8 to 8.4 per OB curbside. Reflexes have been difficult to test, even before starting the magnesium.

The patient also has hypothermia, possibly due to the C-section. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture have been ordered, and warming blankets are being used.

In addition, the patient has depression and is to receive a psychiatry evaluation when medically stabilized. 

The patient's lines include PIV x2 and A-line placement. Communication contacts have been made with the mother, brother, and another person. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is critical care in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. They have a history of recent c-section and are experiencing rising WBC counts, indicating a possible infection. Central line placement was performed with ultrasound guidance, and the patient received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to the procedure to improve INR. The patient's vital signs remain stable with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute and blood pressure of 122/80 mmHg. They are receiving multiple infusions and medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The rising WBC count suggests a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased inflammatory markers, is important.
2. Bleeding: The patient received FFP to improve INR before the central line placement. This increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding or abnormal clotting is necessary.
3. Line infection: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) can occur, especially if proper sterile techniques are not followed during line placement or maintenance. Regular assessment of the line site for signs of infection is essential.
4. Organ dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine, TCO2) indicate possible organ dysfunction. Frequent monitoring of these parameters is necessary to detect any worsening.
5. Respiratory compromise: The patient's ABG results"

   Imaging:
   CXR
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the monitoring
   and
   support devices is unchanged. Also unchanged are the relatively low
   lung
   volumes and the borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. On today's
   examination, there is minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, no
   focal
   parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia are seen. No sign
   suggestive of
   pulmonary edema.
   RUQ ultrasound
   FINDINGS: This examination was initiated at 7:09 p.m. [**2197-8-19**],
   at
   which time several images were obtained by the technologist. The
   examination
   was interrupted at that time as the patient needed to undergo urgent
   procedure
   in the intensive care unit. After multiple attempts to complete the
   examination were unsuccessful due to the patient's urgent clinical
   condition,
   the examination was completed by the technologist on [**2197-8-20**],
   at 10:10
   a.m. Subsequently, the attending radiologist returned to the bedside at
   1:17
   p.m. [**2197-8-20**]. This clip includes images from all three
   acquisitions.
   The hepatic echotexture appears grossly within normal limits. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic
   duct
   measures 5 mm.
   Initial images obtained [**2195-8-19**], show apparent antegrade flow
   in the
   main portal vein with a velocity of approximately 10 cm/sec. However,
   there
   is reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and no definite
   flow
   detectable in the right posterior portal vein. The left portal vein is
   patent
   with antegrade flow. Subsequent images obtained on [**2197-8-20**],
   again
   show reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and antegrade
   (hepatopetal) flow in the left portal vein. However, despite numerous
   attempts both by the senior technologist and the attending radiologist
   at the
   bedside, no measurable flow could be detected in the extra-hepatic main
   portal
   vein. The main hepatic artery is patent. The right, left, and middle
   hepatic
   veins are patent. Flow within the splenic vein is hepatofugal. The
   gallbladder is markedly edematous and nondistended. Imaged portions of
   the
   pancreas appear within normal limits, although the pancreatic tail is
   obscured
   by overlying bowel gas. The spleen measures 14 cm. There is no ascites.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Abnormal flow within the portal system, including reversal of flow
   in the
   right anterior portal vein, no demonstrable flow in the right posterior
   portal
   vein, hepatopetal flow in the left portal vein. While on initial images
   obtained on [**2197-8-19**], there is some apparent antegrade flow in
   the
   extra-hepatic portal vein, no demonstrable flow is present on [**8-20**], [**2196**],
   indicating either thrombosis or extremely slow flow (undetectable).
   These
   results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] at the bedside. As the patient
   cannot
   receive iodinated contrast due to acute renal failure, non-contrast MRI
   may be
   helpful for further assessment of the extra- hepatic portal vein.
   2. Patent hepatic veins and hepatic arteries. The portal venous flow
   abnormalities reported could relate to hepatic sinusoidal occlusion in
   the
   setting of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.
   3. Splenomegaly, compatible with portal hypertension.
   4. Gallbladder edema consistent with liver disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   Plan:
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated liver enzymes (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am).
   INR peaked at 8.1 at 9:22pm. Now values are improving thus she may
   likely be able to avoid transplantation.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - continue serial neuro exams. Currently mental status is good no HA;
   no sign of elevated ICP. Acetazolamide if evidence of ICP develops.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion until AST
   and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue following q6h INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC.
   - Vitamin K 2mg daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue following q12h LFTs
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been wnl.
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound to assess portal vein patency/anatomy.
   # Respiratory failure: Signs of improvement include RISP of 44,
   favorable ABGs, and alert mental status.
   - Trial of extubation today.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising. Urine ouput was 0 for 12 hours, but is
   much improved. Likely a component of ATN from Tylenol, however urine
   lytes from yesterday midday are consistent with pre-renal etiology. U
   osm = 316.
   -          Continue to follow Cr q6hr.
   -          f/u renal recs.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Abdominal pain: New, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing
   infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile and mental status is improving, she is
   normotensive, WBC count is trending down, and she has no vaginal
   bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Morphine 2mg q4h prn for pain.
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 at 5:24pm. Now 28.6. Pt is
   afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC q6h.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show improvement.
   - Continue q6h ABGs.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative. Urine cx from [**8-20**]
   is pending.
   -          f/u urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergent cesarean section this morning for pre-eclampsia. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically elevated liver enzymes (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am). INR peaked at 8.1 at 9:22pm. Now values are improving, indicating she may likely be able to avoid transplantation.

2. Respiratory failure: Signs of improvement include RISP of 44, favorable ABGs, and alert mental status. A trial of extubation is planned today.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): Creatinine still rising. Urine output was 0 for 12 hours, but is much improved. Likely a component of ATN from Tylenol, however urine lytes from yesterday midday are consistent with pre-renal etiology. U osm = 316. The patient will continue to follow Cr q6hr and f/u renal recs.

4. Abdominal pain: New, pulsatile, diffuse abdominal pain could represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less likely given that"

   Imaging:
   CXR
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the monitoring
   and
   support devices is unchanged. Also unchanged are the relatively low
   lung
   volumes and the borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. On today's
   examination, there is minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, no
   focal
   parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia are seen. No sign
   suggestive of
   pulmonary edema.
   RUQ ultrasound
   TECHNIQUE: Right upper quadrant ultrasound and duplex son[**Name (NI) 377**] of the
   liver.
   FINDINGS: This examination was initiated at 7:09 p.m. [**2197-8-19**],
   at
   which time several images were obtained by the technologist. The
   examination
   was interrupted at that time as the patient needed to undergo urgent
   procedure
   in the intensive care unit. After multiple attempts to complete the
   examination were unsuccessful due to the patient's urgent clinical
   condition,
   the examination was completed by the technologist on [**2197-8-20**],
   at 10:10
   a.m. Subsequently, the attending radiologist returned to the bedside at
   1:17
   p.m. [**2197-8-20**]. This clip includes images from all three
   acquisitions.
   The hepatic echotexture appears grossly within normal limits. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic
   duct
   measures 5 mm.
   Initial images obtained [**2195-8-19**], show apparent antegrade flow
   in the
   main portal vein with a velocity of approximately 10 cm/sec. However,
   there
   is reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and no definite
   flow
   detectable in the right posterior portal vein. The left portal vein is
   patent
   with antegrade flow. Subsequent images obtained on [**2197-8-20**],
   again
   show reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and antegrade
   (hepatopetal) flow in the left portal vein. However, despite numerous
   attempts both by the senior technologist and the attending radiologist
   at the
   bedside, no measurable flow could be detected in the extra-hepatic main
   portal
   vein. The main hepatic artery is patent. The right, left, and middle
   hepatic
   veins are patent. Flow within the splenic vein is hepatofugal. The
   gallbladder is markedly edematous and nondistended. Imaged portions of
   the
   pancreas appear within normal limits, although the pancreatic tail is
   obscured
   by overlying bowel gas. The spleen measures 14 cm. There is no ascites.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Abnormal flow within the portal system, including reversal of flow
   in the
   right anterior portal vein, no demonstrable flow in the right posterior
   portal
   vein, hepatopetal flow in the left portal vein. While on initial images
   obtained on [**2197-8-19**], there is some apparent antegrade flow in
   the
   extra-hepatic portal vein, no demonstrable flow is present on [**8-20**], [**2196**],
   indicating either thrombosis or extremely slow flow (undetectable).
   These
   results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] at the bedside. As the patient
   cannot
   receive iodinated contrast due to acute renal failure, non-contrast MRI
   may be
   helpful for further assessment of the extra- hepatic portal vein.
   2. Patent hepatic veins and hepatic arteries. The portal venous flow
   abnormalities reported could relate to hepatic sinusoidal occlusion in
   the
   setting of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.
   3. Splenomegaly, compatible with portal hypertension.
   4. Gallbladder edema consistent with liver disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Acetaminophen overdose, likely fulminant hepatic failure;
   significant likelihood that she will need liver transplant for survival
   - hepatology consult
   - transplant surgery consult
   - transplant SW
   - ethics consult for HIV testing (for transplant evaluation)
   - hepatitis serologies to be run in AM
   - serial neuro exams; neurosurgery consult for intracranial pressure
   monitoring if signs of neurologic changes
   - head CT now to check for evidence of elevated intracranial pressure
   - N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion
   - toxicology aware of patient; recommended checking daily acetaminophen
   levels
   - q6h INR, electrolyes, CBC
   - q12h LFTs
   - q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been wnl
   - RUQ ultrasound to assess portal vein patency/anatomy
   .
   ## Metabolic acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure
   - hyperventillation and bicarbonate drip for correction
   - acetazolamide if evidence of increased intracranial pressure
   - q6h ABGs
   .
   ## s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia
   - magnesium sulfate drip to keep level 4.8 to 8.4 per OB curbside.
   Currently at 9.6; will hold magnesium for now
   - Reflexes have been very difficult to test, even prior to starting mag
   .
   ## Hypothermia: possibly due to C-section
   - check blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture
   - warming blankets
   .
   ## Depression:
   - psychiatry eval when medically stabilized

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of acetaminophen overdose and subsequent fulminant hepatic failure. She has undergone an emergency cesarean section and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has multiple medical complications.

1. Acetaminophen overdose: The patient has a history of intentional acetaminophen overdose, which has led to fulminant hepatic failure. This condition requires immediate medical attention and may necessitate a liver transplant for survival.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute hepatic failure. Treatment includes hyperventilation and bicarbonate drip for correction.

3. Hypothermia: The patient is hypothermic, possibly due to the recent cesarean section. Warming blankets should be used to address this issue.

4. Pre-eclampsia: The patient had pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy, which complicated the cesarean section. She is currently on a magnesium sulfate drip to prevent seizures.

5. Abnormal portal vein flow: The patient's RUQ ultrasound shows abnormal flow within the portal system. There is reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and no demonstrable flow in the right posterior portal vein. Hepatopetal flow is observed in the left portal vein. This finding suggests either thrombosis or extremely slow flow in the extra-hepatic portal vein."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels in the ICU. The patient has been listed for a liver transplant due to acute liver failure. There is a portal vein thrombosis present, and the patient's INR and LFTs are trending down. The patient has negative serologies for hepatitis B and HIV. He is on CPAP and has abnormal ABGs with a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 34, HCO3- of 184, BE of -3, and lactate levels ranging from 5.7 to 9.5.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypoglycemia.
2. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The presence of a portal vein thrombosis can result in further liver damage and complications like variceal bleeding or intestinal ischemia.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. This may lead to oliguria (reduced urine output) and potentially acute kidney injury.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an infection. Infections in the ICU can be severe and life-threatening, especially considering the patient's compromised immune system due to"

   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.

   Plan:
   ## Acetaminophen overdose, likely fulminant hepatic failure;
   significant likelihood that she will need liver transplant for survival
   - hepatology consult
   - transplant surgery consult
   - transplant SW
   - ethics consult for HIV testing (for transplant evaluation)
   - hepatitis serologies to be run in AM
   - serial neuro exams; neurosurgery consult for intracranial pressure
   monitoring if signs of neurologic changes
   - head CT now to check for evidence of elevated intracranial pressure
   - N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion
   - toxicology aware of patient; recommended checking daily acetaminophen
   levels
   - q6h INR, electrolyes, CBC
   - q12h LFTs
   - q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been wnl
   - RUQ ultrasound to assess portal vein patency/anatomy
   .
   ## Metabolic acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure
   - hyperventillation and bicarbonate drip for correction
   - acetazolamide if evidence of increased intracranial pressure
   - q6h ABGs
   .
   ## s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia
   - magnesium sulfate drip to keep level 4.8 to 8.4 per OB curbside.
   Currently at 9.6; will hold magnesium for now
   - Reflexes have been very difficult to test, even prior to starting mag

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, likely as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergent Caesarian section this morning due to pre-eclampsia. The patient requires a liver transplant for survival, and hepatology and transplant surgery consultations have been ordered. Transplant social work and ethics consultations are also planned for HIV testing in preparation for transplant evaluation. Hepatitis serologies will be run in the morning, and serial neuro exams will be conducted with a neurosurgery consult for intracranial pressure monitoring if there are any signs of neurological changes. A head CT will be performed to check for evidence of elevated intracranial pressure.

The patient is currently experiencing metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute hepatic failure. Hyperventilation and bicarbonate drip will be used for correction, and acetazolamide may be given if there is evidence of increased intracranial pressure. ABGs will be checked every 6 hours.

The patient's C-section was complicated by likely pre-eclampsia, and she is receiving a magnesium sulfate drip to maintain a level between 4.8 and 8.4 per OB curbside. However, her magnesium level is currently at 9.6, so it will be held for now.

The patient is also hypothermic, possibly due to the C-section. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She also had an emergency C-section this morning due to pre-eclampsia. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PT/INR), metabolic acidosis, and renal dysfunction. The patient's INR is significantly elevated, indicating a high risk of bleeding. 

The patient's medical complications include potential liver transplant due to fulminant hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, pre-eclampsia with a possible need for magnesium sulfate therapy, and potential intracranial pressure monitoring. 

Given the severity of the patient's condition, potential medical complications may include worsening hepatic failure leading to multiorgan failure, increased intracranial pressure resulting in neurological complications, bleeding due to the high INR, and infection due to immunosuppression. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, coagulation profile, liver function tests, renal function, and electrolyte levels. Continuous monitoring of the patient's neurological status and intracranial pressure is also crucial. Additionally, prompt management of any signs of bleeding and infection is necessary. The patient's need for liver transplantation should be evaluated promptly."

   Imaging:
   CXR
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the monitoring
   and
   support devices is unchanged. Also unchanged are the relatively low
   lung
   volumes and the borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. On today's
   examination, there is minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, no
   focal
   parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia are seen. No sign
   suggestive of
   pulmonary edema.
   RUQ ultrasound
   FINDINGS: This examination was initiated at 7:09 p.m. [**2197-8-19**],
   at
   which time several images were obtained by the technologist. The
   examination
   was interrupted at that time as the patient needed to undergo urgent
   procedure
   in the intensive care unit. After multiple attempts to complete the
   examination were unsuccessful due to the patient's urgent clinical
   condition,
   the examination was completed by the technologist on [**2197-8-20**],
   at 10:10
   a.m. Subsequently, the attending radiologist returned to the bedside at
   1:17
   p.m. [**2197-8-20**]. This clip includes images from all three
   acquisitions.
   The hepatic echotexture appears grossly within normal limits. There is
   no
   intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic
   duct
   measures 5 mm.
   Initial images obtained [**2195-8-19**], show apparent antegrade flow
   in the
   main portal vein with a velocity of approximately 10 cm/sec. However,
   there
   is reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and no definite
   flow
   detectable in the right posterior portal vein. The left portal vein is
   patent
   with antegrade flow. Subsequent images obtained on [**2197-8-20**],
   again
   show reversal of flow in the right anterior portal vein and antegrade
   (hepatopetal) flow in the left portal vein. However, despite numerous
   attempts both by the senior technologist and the attending radiologist
   at the
   bedside, no measurable flow could be detected in the extra-hepatic main
   portal
   vein. The main hepatic artery is patent. The right, left, and middle
   hepatic
   veins are patent. Flow within the splenic vein is hepatofugal. The
   gallbladder is markedly edematous and nondistended. Imaged portions of
   the
   pancreas appear within normal limits, although the pancreatic tail is
   obscured
   by overlying bowel gas. The spleen measures 14 cm. There is no ascites.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Abnormal flow within the portal system, including reversal of flow
   in the
   right anterior portal vein, no demonstrable flow in the right posterior
   portal
   vein, hepatopetal flow in the left portal vein. While on initial images
   obtained on [**2197-8-19**], there is some apparent antegrade flow in
   the
   extra-hepatic portal vein, no demonstrable flow is present on [**8-20**], [**2196**],
   indicating either thrombosis or extremely slow flow (undetectable).
   These
   results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] at the bedside. As the patient
   cannot
   receive iodinated contrast due to acute renal failure, non-contrast MRI
   may be
   helpful for further assessment of the extra- hepatic portal vein.
   2. Patent hepatic veins and hepatic arteries. The portal venous flow
   abnormalities reported could relate to hepatic sinusoidal occlusion in
   the
   setting of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.
   3. Splenomegaly, compatible with portal hypertension.
   4. Gallbladder edema consistent with liver disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   Plan:
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated liver enzymes (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am).
   INR peaked at 8.1 at 9:22pm. Now values are improving thus she may
   likely be able to avoid transplantation.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - continue serial neuro exams. Currently mental status is good no HA;
   no sign of elevated ICP. Acetazolamide if evidence of ICP develops.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion until AST
   and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue following q6h INR, electrolyes, CBC
   - Continue following q12h LFTs
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been wnl.
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound to assess portal vein patency/anatomy.
   # Respiratory failure: Signs of improvement include RISP of 44,
   favorable ABGs, and alert mental status.
   - Trial of extubation today.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising. Urine ouput was 0 for 12 hours, but is
   much improved. Likely a component of ATN from Tylenol, however urine
   lytes from yesterday midday are consistent with pre-renal etiology. U
   osm = 316.
   -          Continue to follow Cr q6hr.
   -          f/u renal recs.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Abdominal pain: New, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing
   infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile and mental status is improving, she is
   normotensive, WBC count is trending down, and she has no vaginal
   bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Morphine 2mg q4h prn for pain.
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 at 5:24pm. Now 28.6. Pt is
   afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC q6h.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show improvement.
   - Continue q6h ABGs.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression:
   -          psychiatry eval when medically stabilized and extubated.
   -          Social work eval when medically stable and extubated.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO until safely extubated.

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also had an emergency C-section this morning for pre-eclampsia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and depression.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.9°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 100%, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 80%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 9, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP + PS with a FiO2 of 0.40, TV of 407, RR of 22, PS of 5, PEEP of 5, and RISP of 44. Her ABGs show improvement in oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT = 8370 and AST = [numeric identifier 373]) at 3 am, but now values are improving. Her INR peaked at 8.1 at 9:22 pm and is now trending down. Her creatinine levels are rising, suggesting acute renal failure, likely due to acetaminophen toxicity. Her urine output is improving from 0 mL/hour to 20-44 mL"

   24 Hour Events:
   Extubated w/o incident yesterday AM.
   RUQ US showed patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow
   directions, no biliary dilatation, R pleural effusion.
   INR recovering, therefore now taken off of xplant list. Blood bank was
   made aware, as they had been reserving blood for her.
   Ordered gentle pain meds, 1mg q6h and hold for any decline in mental
   status. Instructions not to give unless pt fully oriented or HO paged
   to avoid missing altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 384**] from liver failure.
   Renal decided not to dialyze. Will re-evaluate this AM.
   Pt is not passing gas and has not had a BM since Thursday. Surgery
   commented that this is normal post-op, particularly given her
   immobility. Gave lactulose enema x 1
 stool and gas, which is
   continuing.
   Received 1U pRBC for hct of 20 with tachycardia to 110s, per surgery
   recs.
   Desaturated to 86% in the setting of low glucose and grogginess. Put on
   6L by face tent and O2 sat increased into 90s. Off face tent sats
   around 90.
   Recurrent hypoglycemias, with FSBG of 44 and 72. Given 25mg D.
   SW and Psych consulted. Recs pending.
   Subjective:
   Abdominal pain unchanged. Otherwise sleepy but comfortable. Feels very
   embarrassed about her suicide attempt, but glad that it didn
t work.
   Not currently suicidal or feeling depressed.

   Imaging:
   RUQ US
   FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality. There is no
   biliary dilatation seen. A right pleural effusion is noted.
   DOPPLER EXAMINATION: The main portal vein, right portal vein and left
   portal
   vein are all patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate flow is seen in
   the
   hepatic veins and the IVC. The splenic vein and SMV are patent with
   flow
   toward the liver. Appropriate hepatic waveforms are seen in the main
   hepatic
   artery. Since the examination of one day prior, the previous reversal
   of
   flow in the right portal and splenic veins has resolved.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions.
   Previously
   present flow reversal in right portal vein and splenic vein has
   resolved and
   main portal venous hepatopetal flow is now demonstrated.
   2. No biliary dilatation.
   3. Right pleural effusion.
   CXR: Increased diffuse haziness, worse at bases.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]).
   - continue serial neuro exams. Currently mental status is good no HA;
   no sign of elevated ICP.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   ***- Following ???? q8h INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  FSBGs have been low (44 and 72).
   # Respiratory failure: Now extubated however respiratory status still
   somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, but good IS.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising. Uring output continuing but low.
   -          Continue to follow Cr
   -          f/u renal recs.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Abdominal pain: New, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing
   infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile and mental status is improving, she is
   normotensive, WBC count is trending down, and she has no vaginal
   bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Morphine 1mg q4h prn for pain, but only to be given if clear
   mental status.
   -  Conservative pain measures such as heat packs
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM given changing renal status amd
   re-dose as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**2197-8-20**]. Now slowly falling.
   Pt is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show improvement.
   - Continue q6h ABGs.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative. Urine cx from [**8-20**]
   is pending.
   -          f/u urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery and hypermagnesemic
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression:
   - Psych and SW evals pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergency C-section due to pre-eclampsia.
- She was extubated without incident yesterday morning.
- A right pleural effusion is noted on the RUQ US.
- Her INR is recovering, so she has been taken off the transplant list. Blood bank was aware and had reserved blood for her.
- Gentle pain medications are ordered, with a hold for any decline in mental status to avoid missing altered mental status due to liver failure.
- Renal decided not to dialyze, and will re-evaluate in the morning.
- The patient has not passed gas or had a bowel movement since Thursday, but this is considered normal post-op, particularly given her immobility. A lactulose enema was given, resulting in stool and gas.
- She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 20 with tachycardia in the range of 110s, as per surgery recommendations.
- The patient desaturated to 86% in the setting of low glucose and grogginess. She was placed on 6 liters of face tent oxygen, and her oxygen saturation increased to the 90s. She is now off the face tent with oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated liver enzymes (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am).
   INR peaked at 8.1 at 9:22pm. Now values are improving thus she may
   likely be able to avoid transplantation.
   - continue serial neuro exams. Currently mental status is good no HA;
   no sign of elevated ICP. Acetazolamide if evidence of ICP develops.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine at 17 mg/kg continuous infusion until AST
   and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   ***- Following ???? q8h INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been low
   # Respiratory failure: Signs of improvement include RISP of 44,
   favorable ABGs, and alert mental status.
   - Now extubated and doing well
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising. Uring output was increasing, but fell
   off overnight.
   -          Continue to follow Cr
   -          f/u renal recs.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Abdominal pain: New, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing
   infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile and mental status is improving, she is
   normotensive, WBC count is trending down, and she has no vaginal
   bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Morphine 1mg q4h prn for pain, but only to be given if clear
   mental status.
   -  Conservative pain measures such as heat packs
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM given changing renal status amd
   re-dose as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**2197-8-20**]. Now slowly falling.
   Pt is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show improvement.
   - Continue q6h ABGs.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative. Urine cx from [**8-20**]
   is pending.
   -          f/u urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery and hypermagnesemic
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression:
   - Psych and SW evals pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also had an emergent Caesarian section this morning for pre-eclampsia. 

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Acetaminophen overdose: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) peaked at extremely high levels, indicating severe liver damage. However, her INR values are now improving, suggesting that her liver function is gradually recovering.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown signs of improvement, including a favorable arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, an RISP (respiratory index) of 44, and an alert mental status. She has been successfully extubated and is doing well.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are still rising, indicating ongoing kidney dysfunction. Her urine output was initially increasing but decreased overnight.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing new, pulsatile, diffuse abdominal pain. This could be due to post-operative pain, hepatic failure, or developing infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less likely given the absence of fever, improving mental status, normotensive condition, and decreasing white blood cell count.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count peaked at 34"

   Imaging:
   RUQ US
   FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality. There is no
   biliary dilatation seen. A right pleural effusion is noted.
   DOPPLER EXAMINATION: The main portal vein, right portal vein and left
   portal
   vein are all patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate flow is seen in
   the
   hepatic veins and the IVC. The splenic vein and SMV are patent with
   flow
   toward the liver. Appropriate hepatic waveforms are seen in the main
   hepatic
   artery. Since the examination of one day prior, the previous reversal
   of
   flow in the right portal and splenic veins has resolved.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions.
   Previously
   present flow reversal in right portal vein and splenic vein has
   resolved and
   main portal venous hepatopetal flow is now demonstrated.
   2. No biliary dilatation.
   3. Right pleural effusion.
   CXR: Increased diffuse haziness, worse at bases.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]).
   - continue serial neuro exams. Currently mental status is good no HA;
   no sign of elevated ICP.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   ***- Following ???? q8h INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  BGs have been low (
   # Respiratory failure: Signs of improvement include RISP of 44,
   favorable ABGs, and alert mental status.
   - Now extubated and doing well
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising. Uring output was increasing, but fell
   off overnight.
   -          Continue to follow Cr
   -          f/u renal recs.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Abdominal pain: New, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. developing
   infection such as chorioamnionitis. However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile and mental status is improving, she is
   normotensive, WBC count is trending down, and she has no vaginal
   bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Morphine 1mg q4h prn for pain, but only to be given if clear
   mental status.
   -  Conservative pain measures such as heat packs
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM given changing renal status amd
   re-dose as needed
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**2197-8-20**]. Now slowly falling.
   Pt is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show improvement.
   - Continue q6h ABGs.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative. Urine cx from [**8-20**]
   is pending.
   -          f/u urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery and hypermagnesemic
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression:
   - Psych and SW evals pending.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO until she has a bowel movement.

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman who is currently in the ICU for multiple complications following an acetaminophen overdose, which led to hepatic failure. She also had an emergency C-section due to pre-eclampsia. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and positive urinalysis. 

Based on the provided information, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been extubated successfully. 

The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and coagulation abnormalities (INR). Her renal function is impaired, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings below normal. 

The patient's imaging shows a patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions and no biliary dilatation. However, there is a right pleural effusion noted. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing N-acetylcysteine infusion until the acetaminophen level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000. She is also receiving vitamin K supplementation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management"

   24 Hour Events:
   Extubated w/o incident yesterday AM. Breathing comfortably on RA
   afterwards.
   RUQ US showed patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow
   directions, no biliary dilatation, R pleural effusion.
   INR recovering, therefore now taken off of xplant list. Blood bank was
   made aware, as they had been reserving blood for her.
   Renal decided not to dialyze. Will re-evaluate this AM.
   Ordered gentle pain meds, 1mg q6h and hold for any decline in mental
   status. Instructions not to give unless pt fully oriented or HO paged
   to avoid missing altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 384**] from liver failure.
   Received 1U pRBC for hct of 20 with tachycardia to 110s, per surgery
   recs.
   Desaturated to 86% in the setting of low glucose and grogginess. Put on
   6L by face tent and O2 sat increased into 90s. Off face tent sats
   around 90.
   Recurrent hypoglycemias, with FSBG of 44 and 72. Given 25mg D.
   Pt is not passing gas and has not had a BM since Thursday. Surgery
   commented that this is normal post-op, particularly given her
   immobility. Gave lactulose enema x 1
 stool and gas, which is
   continuing.
   SW and Psych consulted. Recs pending.
   Subjective:
   Sleepy but denies HA or confusion. Does not feel particularly SOB.
   Abdominal pain unchanged. Feels very embarrassed about her suicide
   attempt, but glad that it didn
t work. Not currently suicidal or
   feeling depressed. Thirsty.

   FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality. There is no
   biliary dilatation seen. A right pleural effusion is noted.
   DOPPLER EXAMINATION: The main portal vein, right portal vein and left
   portal
   vein are all patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate flow is seen in
   the
   hepatic veins and the IVC. The splenic vein and SMV are patent with
   flow
   toward the liver. Appropriate hepatic waveforms are seen in the main
   hepatic
   artery. Since the examination of one day prior, the previous reversal
   of
   flow in the right portal and splenic veins has resolved.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions.
   Previously
   present flow reversal in right portal vein and splenic vein has
   resolved and
   main portal venous hepatopetal flow is now demonstrated.
   2. No biliary dilatation.
   3. Right pleural effusion.
   CXR:
                        Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   Low lung volumes.
   Per my read, increased diffuse haziness that is worse at bases.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]).
   - Continue serial neuro exams with close attention to mental status.
   Keep transplant surgery abreast of any changes in mental status.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Following q6h INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs for the next
   12 hours, then consider spacing out.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  FSBGs have been low (44 and 72 and 70).
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal pain: Stable, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other
   intrabdominal inflammation (such as pancreatitis), v. developing
   infection (such as chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is
   stable, and she has no vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds. Morphine 1mg q4h prn for pain, but only
   to be given if clear mental status.
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM given changing renal status amd
   re-dose as needed.
   - OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return of
   normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Vaginal
   bleeding is scant. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped an
   appropriate 3.5 points. Hct has declined just 1 point since then,
   confirming that there is no current brisk bleed.
   -          Continue to follow q6h hct.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative. Urine cx from [**8-20**]
   is pending.
   -          f/u urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show resolution: pH = 7.42.
   - D/c regular ABGs.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery and hypermagnesemic
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   - Psych and SW evals today. They have been contact[**Name (NI) **].
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Turn NG suction off. Advance diet as tolerated, as long as
   pt continues passing gas or having BMs and mental status is alert
   enough to allow for safe swallowing. Continue to follow electrolytes
   q6h today and replete as needed.
   Glycemic Control:  Finger sticks q2h. Amps of D50% for hypoglycemia.
   ADAT, as above.
   Lines:
   PIV x 2.
   A-line
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: Boots, SQ UF Heparin
   Stress ulcer:
   VAP: HOB elevation. Incentive spirometry hourly. OOB as tolerated.
   Communication:  Mom and Dad in the hospital most of the day and night.
   Code status: Full.
   Disposition: ICU.

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman who presented with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She also underwent an emergency C-section due to pre-eclampsia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, anemia, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis. She has a history of attempted suicide and is currently not feeling suicidal or depressed. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.8°F, blood pressure 140/91 mmHg, heart rate 109 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on 6L by face tent. The patient's physical examination reveals a patent hepatic vasculature without biliary dilatation, right pleural effusion, and a clean Phanensteil incision without signs of infection. Laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (ALT = 8370, AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**]), an INR of 8.1, low blood glucose levels, and abnormal renal function with a creatinine level of 5.5. The patient is currently extubated and tolerating oral intake, but has decreased air movement and crackles at the bases bilaterally on chest auscultation. She has a history of hypoglycemia, anemia, and leukocytosis, and is at risk for deep vein throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]). Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward, save for T bili which is still lagging. AFP was checked per
   toxicology and is high (77), indicating regeneration of liver.
   - Continue serial neuro exams with close attention to mental status.
   Keep transplant surgery abreast of any changes in mental status.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Change INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs checks to q 12 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Altered mental status: Ammonia toxicity (she has an asterixis flap)
   v. diphenhydramine effect v. hypoglycemic effect (less likely given
   that she has been altered when blood sugars are normal) v. delirium
   from being in the ICU, being ill, and having very disturbed sleep v. Mg
   toxicity (but hyper- not hyporeflexic and Mg trending downward) v. low
   ionized Ca+.
   -          Recheck ionized Ca.
   -          Follow asterixis flap.
   # Elevated phosphorous: PO4 10.1, total Ca = 7.5 but ionized Ca from
   yesterday was 0.97.
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal pain: Stable, pulsitile, diffuse abdominal pain could
   represent expected post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other
   intrabdominal inflammation (such as pancreatitis), v. developing
   infection (such as chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less
   likely given that pt is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is
   stable, and she has no vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds. Morphine 1mg q4h prn for pain, but only
   to be given if clear mental status.
   -          Continue to monitor symptom and physical exam, as well as
   vitals and WBC.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   -          Repeat vanc trough in AM given changing renal status amd
   re-dose as needed.
   - OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return of
   normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Vaginal
   bleeding is scant. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped an
   appropriate 3.5 points. Hct has declined just 1 point since then,
   confirming that there is no current brisk bleed.
   -          Continue to follow q6h hct.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows atelectasis, but no sign of
   pneumonia. Phanensteil incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts
   appear normal. U/A from [**8-20**] showed 147 WBC. Urine cx from [**8-19**] was
   negative, but an infection could have developed since then.
   -          Continue to follow WBC
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative. However, hold vanc for now as level is
   supertherapeutic.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Send a repeat U/A and urine cx.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis from acute
   hepatic failure. ABGs show resolution: pH = 7.42.
   - D/c regular ABGs.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - d/c MgSO4, as she is now 48hrs post-delivery and hypermagnesemic
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   - Psych and SW evals today. They have been contact[**Name (NI) **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure due to acetaminophen overdose and a history of pre-eclampsia. She underwent an emergency cesarean section and is currently in the ICU. Her mental status has been increasingly altered, with confusion and impulsive behavior. She has a history of abdominal pain, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, anemia, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis. She is on various medications including N-acetylcysteine, vancomycin, and zosyn. Her recent labs show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as electrolyte imbalances. She has a positive urine amylase level and an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure. It is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a potential infection. The presence of fever or positive cultures would confirm this.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and low urine output, suggesting acute kidney injury. This may be a result of the acetaminophen overdose or sepsis.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergency Caesarian section due to pre-eclampsia. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are dramatically elevated, indicating severe liver damage. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthesis of proteins.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has respiratory failure and increased pulmonary edema on chest x-ray. ARDS is a possibility, characterized by severe hypoxia and diffuse alveolar damage.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has rising creatinine levels and low urine output, suggesting AKI. This could be due to acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity or pre-renal causes.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient frequently experiences hypoglycemia, likely due to hepatic damage from acetaminophen overdose. Frequent blood glucose monitoring and dextrose supplementation are required.
5. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to potential infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to identify any signs of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]). Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward, save for T bili which is still lagging. AFP was checked per
   toxicology and is high (77), indicating regeneration of liver.
   - Continue serial neuro exams with close attention to mental status.
   - Repeat head CT.
   - Check lactate, given increase anion gap.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Change INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs checks to q 12 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Altered mental status: Ammonia toxicity (she has an asterixis flap)
   v. diphenhydramine effect v. hypoglycemic effect (less likely given
   that she has been altered when blood sugars are normal) v. delirium
   from being in the ICU, being ill, and having very disturbed sleep v. Mg
   toxicity (but hyper- not hyporeflexic and Mg trending downward) v. low
   ionized Ca+.
   -          Follow asterixis flap.
   -          Try lactulose PO.
   -          Repeat head CT.
   -          Could try haldol for delirium, per psych. Not currently
   appropriate.
   # Elevated phosphorous: PO4 10.1, total Ca = 7.5 but ionized Ca from
   yesterday was 0.97.
   -          Aluminum hydroxide, 30mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention increased today.
   Tympanic centrally. Diffuse abdominal pain could represent expected
   post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other intrabdominal inflammation
   (such as pancreatitis), v. developing infection (such as
   chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less likely given that pt
   is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is stable, and she has no
   vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   -          OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return
   of normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Lochia has
   picked up since getting OOB, however still not substantial enough to
   account for anemia. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped less
   than 1 point.
   -          Follow q12h hcts.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows no sign of pneumonia. Phanensteil
   incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts appear normal.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   -         Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergency cesarean section this morning for pre-eclampsia. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits confusion, impulsive behavior, and an asterixis flap, which may be due to ammonia toxicity, diphenhydramine effect, hypoglycemic effect, delirium from being in the ICU, or magnesium toxicity.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient was successfully extubated yesterday, her respiratory status remains tenuous with decreased air movement and breath sounds at the bases. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema or effusion on the chest X-ray.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, and urine output is low. FeNa this morning is 1.8, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from acetaminophen.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday. This may be a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
5. Abdominal distention and pain: The patient's abdominal distention has increased, and she experiences diffuse abdominal pain. This could be due to post-operative"

   Head CT: cerebral edema.
   Pulled out central venous line. PICC and PIV placed.
   2u PRBCs for hct <21. Lead to 3pt bump in hct.
   CT abdomen:
   Q6H serum osm. If <320 12.5gm mannitol. Got a dose at 5pm, midnight,
   and 6:30am.
   Renal: Started on CVVH given intracerebral edema and need for diuresis.
   2 u frozen plasma were given to normalize INR prior to beginning
   hemodialysis. Goal fluid balance was 100mL more negative than the
   amount of mannitol given.
   Neurosurgery: Serial neuro exams. If pupils become fixed/dilated will
   consider surgery otherwise no need now. Plan to place and ICP monitor
   today.
   Intubated at midnight. RIJ CVL and A-line placed.
   Heme: No hemolysis. Check indirect bili and coombs test and fibrinogen
   level. (pending).
   Hepatology: Send urine organic acid as may be contributing to high
   anion gap. Apparently when liver begins metabolizing acetominophen the
   metabolites can build up organic acids and cause an anion gap.

   Micro:
   VRE rectal swab negative.
   Varicella zoster immune.
   Imaging:
   Abdominal US:
   FINDINGS: Small amount of ascites is noted in the right upper quadrant
   in the
   perihepatic region as well as in the left upper quadrant. The right
   lower
   quadrant demonstrates the largest pocket of ascites measuring
   approximately 5
   cm in depth.
   IMPRESSION:
   Four quadrant survey demonstrates a small amount of ascites with the
   largest
   pocket in the right lower quadrant measuring 5.2 cm.
   In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 398**], the decision to perform
   diagnostic
   paracentesis was deferred in view of elevated INR (INR 3.2).
   Head CT:
   PFI: Compared to prior examination, there is more prominent effacement
   of the
   cerebral sulci especially at the convexity. The ventricles remain small
   in
   size with stable in appearance. There is no evidence for herniation. No
   hemorrhage.
   Repeat head CT:
   No interval change in degree of edema, and no new hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]). Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward, save for T bili which is still lagging. AFP was checked per
   toxicology and is high (77), indicating regeneration of liver.
   - Continue serial neuro exams with close attention to mental status.
   - Repeat head CT.
   - Check lactate, given increase anion gap.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Change INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs checks to q 12 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Altered mental status: Ammonia toxicity (she has an asterixis flap)
   v. diphenhydramine effect v. hypoglycemic effect (less likely given
   that she has been altered when blood sugars are normal) v. delirium
   from being in the ICU, being ill, and having very disturbed sleep v. Mg
   toxicity (but hyper- not hyporeflexic and Mg trending downward) v. low
   ionized Ca+.
   -          Follow asterixis flap.
   -          Try lactulose PO.
   -          Repeat head CT.
   -          Could try haldol for delirium, per psych. Not currently
   appropriate.
   # Elevated phosphorous: PO4 10.1, total Ca = 7.5 but ionized Ca from
   yesterday was 0.97.
   -          Aluminum hydroxide, 30mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention increased today.
   Tympanic centrally. Diffuse abdominal pain could represent expected
   post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other intrabdominal inflammation
   (such as pancreatitis), v. developing infection (such as
   chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less likely given that pt
   is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is stable, and she has no
   vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   -          OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return
   of normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Lochia has
   picked up since getting OOB, however still not substantial enough to
   account for anemia. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped less
   than 1 point.
   -          Follow q12h hcts.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows no sign of pneumonia. Phanensteil
   incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts appear normal.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   -         Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose as a suicide attempt. She also underwent an emergency Caesarian section this morning for pre-eclampsia. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Neurologic Complications:
   - Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to ammonia toxicity, diphenhydramine effect, hypoglycemic effect, delirium from being in the ICU, or magnesium toxicity.
   - Asterixis flap: The patient has an asterixis flap, which is a sign of hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Repeat head CT: The patient's neurologic status should be closely monitored, and a repeat head CT may be necessary to assess any changes in cerebral edema.

2. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient previously experienced respiratory failure and was successfully extubated yesterday. However, her respiratory status remains tenuous with decreased air movement and breath sounds at the bases. A chest x-ray suggests increased pulmonary edema or effusion.
   - Trial off O2 by face tent: The patient should be gradually weaned off supplemental oxygen.
   - Continue IS (invasive suctioning) at least hourly: The patient's airway should be suctioned regularly to maintain patency.
   - HOB (head of bed) elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]). Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward, save for T bili which is still lagging. AFP was checked per
   toxicology and is high (77), indicating regeneration of liver.
   - Continue serial neuro exams with close attention to mental status.
   - Repeat head CT.
   - Check lactate, given increase anion gap.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Change INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs checks to q 12 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Altered mental status: Ammonia toxicity (she has an asterixis flap)
   v. diphenhydramine effect v. hypoglycemic effect (less likely given
   that she has been altered when blood sugars are normal) v. delirium
   from being in the ICU, being ill, and having very disturbed sleep v. Mg
   toxicity (but hyper- not hyporeflexic and Mg trending downward) v. low
   ionized Ca+.
   -          Follow asterixis flap.
   -          Try lactulose PO.
   -          Repeat head CT.
   -          Could try haldol for delirium, per psych. Not currently
   appropriate.
   # Elevated phosphorous: PO4 10.1, total Ca = 7.5 but ionized Ca from
   yesterday was 0.97.
   -          Aluminum hydroxide, 30mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention increased today.
   Tympanic centrally. Diffuse abdominal pain could represent expected
   post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other intrabdominal inflammation
   (such as pancreatitis), v. developing infection (such as
   chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less likely given that pt
   is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is stable, and she has no
   vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   -          OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return
   of normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Lochia has
   picked up since getting OOB, however still not substantial enough to
   account for anemia. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped less
   than 1 point.
   -          Follow q12h hcts.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows no sign of pneumonia. Phanensteil
   incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts appear normal.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   -         Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 22-year-old woman who presented with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, which was attempted as a suicide. She also underwent an emergency cesarean section due to pre-eclampsia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, abdominal distention and pain, anemia, leukocytosis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as ammonia toxicity, diphenhydramine effect, hypoglycemic effect, delirium from being in the ICU, disturbed sleep, magnesium toxicity, or low ionized calcium. Immediate attention should be given to monitor the patient's neurologic status and correct any identified imbalances.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still tenuous despite being successfully extubated yesterday. Decreased air movement and breath sounds at the bases suggest increased pulmonary edema or effusion. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory function and consider measures such as a trial off oxygen, incentive spirometry, elevating the head of bed, and encouraging out-of-bed activities.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating ongoing renal impairment. FeNa ("

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cerebral edema. Neurosurgery consulted and recommended serial neuro exams, with consideration for surgery if pupils become fixed or dilated. The patient has no hemolysis, but further tests are pending to check indirect bilirubin, coombs test, and fibrinogen level. Renal function is being monitored due to intracerebral edema and the need for diuresis. CVVH was started, and RIJ CVL and A-line were placed. Hepatology suggested sending urine organic acids as they may contribute to high anion gap. The patient has no known drug allergies. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular examination are not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed. 

Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and decreased Plt. Cr and TCO2 levels are within normal range, but glucose levels are low.

The patient is a 25-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cerebral edema, requiring mannitol administration and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to intracerebral edema and need for diuresis. The patient has no known drug allergies. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and ABG results are provided. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. The patient is on multiple medications for ICU care, glycemic control, prophylaxis, and nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxicity from medications.
3. Hepatic dysfunction indicated by elevated liver enzymes.
4. Coagulopathy indicated by prolonged PT/PTT/increased INR.
5. Infection suggested by elevated white blood cell count.
6. Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis indicated by ABG results.
7. Potential electrolyte imbalances indicated by abnormal sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphate levels.
8. Potential respiratory compromise indicated by ABG results.

138823.0,245492,2197-08-24 06:56:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   Head CT: cerebral edema.
   Pulled out central venous line. PICC and PIV placed.
   2u PRBCs for hct <21. Lead to 3pt bump in hct.
   CT abdomen:
   Q6H serum osm. If <320 12.5gm mannitol. Got a dose at 5pm, midnight,
   and 6:30am.
   Renal: Started on CVVH given intracerebral edema and need for diuresis.
   2 u frozen plasma were given to normalize INR prior to beginning
   hemodialysis. Goal fluid balance was 100mL more negative than the
   amount of mannitol given.
   Neurosurgery: Serial neuro exams. If pupils become fixed/dilated will
   consider surgery otherwise no need now.
   Intubated at midnight. RIJ CVL and A-line placed.
   Heme: No hemolysis. Check indirect bili and coombs test and fibrinogen
   level. (pending).
   Hepatology: Send urine organic acid as may be contributing to high
   anion gap. Apparently when liver begins metabolizing acetominophen the
   metabolites can build up organic acids and cause an anion gap.
   Off propofol for 45mins, but remained essentially unresponsive and had
   Cushingoid reflex (HTN and bradycardia).
   Repeat head CT done at 6:30am.
   Neurosurg plans to take her for placement of an ICP monitor.
   Hyperventilation to PC02 of 30, 3u FFP, fibrinogen, platelets before
   then. Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure above 70, with pressors if
   necessary.
   Renal plans to ultrafiltrate her, with goal of bringing serum osms up
   to 325.

   Micro:
   VRE rectal swab negative.
   Varicella zoster immune.
   Imaging:
   Abdominal US:
   FINDINGS: Small amount of ascites is noted in the right upper quadrant
   in the
   perihepatic region as well as in the left upper quadrant. The right
   lower
   quadrant demonstrates the largest pocket of ascites measuring
   approximately 5
   cm in depth.
   IMPRESSION:
   Four quadrant survey demonstrates a small amount of ascites with the
   largest
   pocket in the right lower quadrant measuring 5.2 cm.
   In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 398**], the decision to perform
   diagnostic
   paracentesis was deferred in view of elevated INR (INR 3.2).
   Head CT:
   PFI: Compared to prior examination, there is more prominent effacement
   of the
   cerebral sulci especially at the convexity. The ventricles remain small
   in
   size with stable in appearance. There is no evidence for herniation. No
   hemorrhage.
   Repeat head CT:
   No interval change in degree of edema, and no new hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   # Altered mental status: Due to elevated ICP. Underlying etiology
   remains unclear; Ammonia toxicity (she has an asterixis flap) v.
   diphenhydramine effect v. hypoglycemic effect (less likely given that
   she has been altered when blood sugars are normal) v. delirium from
   being in the ICU, being ill, and having very disturbed sleep v. Mg
   toxicity (but hyper- not hyporeflexic and Mg trending downward) v. low
   ionized Ca+.
   -          Elevated HOB.
   -          ICP monitor to be placed this AM.
   -          FFP, platelets, cryprecipitate, hyperventilation in
   preparation of procedure.
   -          Continue mannitol.
   #Acetaminophen overdose: Leading to hepatic failure with dramatically
   elevated LFTs (peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and
   INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]). Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward, save for T bili which is still lagging. AFP was checked per
   toxicology and is high (77), indicating regeneration of liver.
   - Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue N-acetylcysteine 1462 mg/hr IV drip until acetaminophen
   level is undetectable and AST and ALT drop below 1000.
   - Change INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC, and LFTs checks to q 12 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily per hepatology rec: will not obscure degree of
   liver function because liver will only be able to use vit K to make
   clotting factors to the degree to which it
s functional.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:
   -          F/u labs
   # Elevated phosphorous: PO4 10.1, total Ca = 7.5 but ionized Ca from
   yesterday was 0.97.
   -          Aluminum hydroxide, 30mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: Successfully extubated yesterday, however
   respiratory status still somewhat tenuous. Decreased air movement, and
   breath sounds at bases this AM. Chest x-ray suggests increased
   pulmonary edema v. effusion.
   -          Trial off O2 by face tent.
   -          Continue IS at least hourly.
   -          HOB elevated.
   -          Encourage OOB.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Creatinine still rising and currently 5.5. Urine output
   continuing but low (10-20cc/hr). FeNa this AM = 1.8, consistent with
   ATN from acetaminophen.
   -          Renal recommends holding off on dialysis for today, as
   kidneys are continuing to produce urine at a low rate and body is
   managing the fluid overload.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   Has been frequently hypoglycemic since stopping D5W yesterday because
   of concern for volume overload in the setting of ARF and pulmonary
   edema.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   -          Turn NG suction off then advance diet as tolerated, as soon
   as pt is consistently passing gas and having BMs.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention increased today.
   Tympanic centrally. Diffuse abdominal pain could represent expected
   post-op pain v. hepatic failure v. other intrabdominal inflammation
   (such as pancreatitis), v. developing infection (such as
   chorioamnionitis). However, infection seems less likely given that pt
   is afebrile, she is normotensive, WBC count is stable, and she has no
   vaginal bleeding or exudate from wound.
   -          Continue efforts to use local comfort measures (ie heat
   packs) and minimize pain meds.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   -          OOB as tolerated today, which is likely to help speed return
   of normal bowel function.
   # Anemia: Likely due to combination of post-partum, s/p c-section,
   dilutional, and stress-related bone marrow suppression. Lochia has
   picked up since getting OOB, however still not substantial enough to
   account for anemia. Pt received 1u PRBCs yesterday and hct bumped less
   than 1 point.
   -          Follow q12h hcts.
   -          Consider transfusing for hct < 20 if there are signs of
   hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving; peaked at 34.9 [**8-20**]. Now slowly falling. Pt
   is afebrile, so this could represent an inflammatory reaction in the
   setting of hepatic failure. CXR shows no sign of pneumonia. Phanensteil
   incision looks uninfected, as above. Breasts appear normal.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Not currently feeling suicidal, but rather just very
   embarrassed.
   -         Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   Breasts are non-tender.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's altered mental status may be due to elevated ICP, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed properly.

2. Acetaminophen overdose: The patient has a history of acetaminophen overdose, which has led to hepatic failure. Continued monitoring of acetaminophen levels and administration of N-acetylcysteine are necessary to prevent further liver damage.

3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient is experiencing anion gap metabolic acidosis, which needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate interventions.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still somewhat tenuous, with decreased air movement and breath sounds at the bases. This suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema or effusion, which requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions.

5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating renal impairment. This may be due to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and dialysis may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens.

6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been frequently hypoglycemic, likely as a sequelae of Tylenol-induced hepatic damage. Frequent"

   Head CT showed cerebral edema.
   Pt pulled out her central venous line. PICC and PIV placed.
   2u PRBCs for hct <21. Lead to 3pt bump in hct.
   US abdomen: Small amount of ascites. Decision not to tap because of
   high INR.
   Intubated at 5pm. RIJ CVL and A-line placed.
   Q6H serum osm. For serum osms <20 got a 20g dose at 5pm, and a 12.5g
   dose at midnight and 6:30am.
   Renal: Started on CVVH given intracerebral edema and need for diuresis.
   2 u frozen plasma were given to normalize INR prior to beginning
   hemodialysis. Goal fluid balance was 100mL more negative than the
   amount of mannitol given.
   Neurosurgery: Serial neuro exams. If pupils become fixed/dilated will
   consider surgery otherwise no need now.
   Heme: No hemolysis based on blood smear. Check indirect bili and coombs
   test and fibrinogen level. (pending).
   Hepatology: Send urine organic acid as may be contributing to high
   anion gap. Apparently when liver begins metabolizing acetominophen the
   metabolites can build up organic acids and cause an anion gap.
   Toxicology: Check ASA level.
   Off propofol for 45mins, but remained essentially unresponsive, had
   Cushingoid reflex (HTN and bradycardia), and dilated but reactive
   pupils (1 cm).
   Repeat head CT done at 6:30am showed stable cerebral edema.
   Neurosurg plans to take her for placement of an ICP monitor.
   Hyperventilation to PC02 of 30, 3u FFP, fibrinogen, platelets before
   then. If INR is still > 1.5, give factor VII. Maintain cerebral
   perfusion pressure above 70, with pressors if necessary.
   Renal plans to ultrafiltrate her, with goal of bringing serum osms up
   to 325.

   Imaging:
   Abdominal US:
   FINDINGS: Small amount of ascites is noted in the right upper quadrant
   in the
   perihepatic region as well as in the left upper quadrant. The right
   lower
   quadrant demonstrates the largest pocket of ascites measuring
   approximately 5

   IMPRESSION:
   Four quadrant survey demonstrates a small amount of ascites with the
   largest
   pocket in the right lower quadrant measuring 5.2 cm.
   In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 398**], the decision to perform
   diagnostic
   paracentesis was deferred in view of elevated INR (INR 3.2).
   Head CT:
   PFI: Compared to prior examination, there is more prominent effacement
   of the
   cerebral sulci especially at the convexity. The ventricles remain small
   in
   size with stable in appearance. There is no evidence for herniation. No
   hemorrhage.
   Repeat head CT:
   No interval change in degree of edema, and no new hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to elevated ICP. Underlying
   etiology remains unclear.
   -          [**Name2 (NI) 399**]ted HOB 30 degrees.
   -          ICP monitor to be placed this AM by neurosurg.
   -          Give FFP, platelets, cryprecipitate, hyperventilation (to
   PCO2 of 30) in preparation of procedure. [**Month (only) 8**] need factor VII if INR
   still > 1.5. Goal platelets >75. Goal fibrinogen >150.
   -          Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP drip,
   additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -          Increase mannitol to as high as 50g q6h with osm goal of
   325. Check serum osm 1hr after mannitol.
   -          Follow post-procedure protocol provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] (copy
   in chart).
   -          Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   -          Decrease NAC to 6mg/kg/hr, in case that is having unexpected
   effects on mental status.
   -          Minimize stimulation of patient.
   # Acetaminophen-induced hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and
   AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver
   enzymes have been trending downward since then, and now even T bili is
   trending down. AFP was checked per toxicology and is high (77),
   indicating regeneration of liver. Acetaminophen level falling (7.5
   today).
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue NAC at lower dose, as above.
   -          Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q 4 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # Respiratory failure: Respiratory failure is linked to decline in
   mental status.
   -          Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   -          Hyperventilate to keep PCO2 at 30.
   -          HOB elevated 30 degrees
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Cr now falling, while on CVVH.
   -          Switch from CVVH to ultrafiltration with goal of removing
   100cc more than amount of mannitol given.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention slightly
   decreased today. Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution
   from ileus and from small ascited.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion. Could be partially dilutional, as she is net
   positive 14L for her length of stay.
   -          Follow q4h hcts.
   -          Transfusing for hct < 25.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving steadily.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Difficult to assess today, as she is intubated and
   sedated.
   -          Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, as well as a recent emergency C-section for pre-eclampsia. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to respiratory failure. Her mental status is altered, and there are concerns about elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The patient has several medical complications, including anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, anemia, leukocytosis, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She also has a history of depression and underwent a C-section complicated by pre-eclampsia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated ICP: The patient's altered mental status and cerebral edema on the head CT suggest a potential increase in intracranial pressure. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further neurological deterioration.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. CVVH has been initiated, but the plan is to switch to ultrafiltration to remove excess fluid.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels require close monitoring and repletion with dextrose as needed.

4. Anemia: Despite receiving blood transfusions, the patient's hemoglobin concentration has not improved significantly. Further investigation and transfusion for hct < 25 may be required.

   22 year old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following
   acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Also s/p emergent Caesarian
   section this morning for pre-ecclampsia.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to elevated ICP. Underlying
   etiology remains unclear.
   -          [**Name2 (NI) 399**]ted HOB 30 degrees.
   -          ICP monitor to be placed this AM by neurosurg.
   -          Give FFP, platelets, cryprecipitate, hyperventilation (to
   PCO2 of 30) in preparation of procedure. [**Month (only) 8**] need factor VII if INR
   still > 1.5. Goal platelets >75. Goal fibrinogen >150.
   -          Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP drip,
   additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -          Increase mannitol to as high as 50g q6h with osm goal of
   325. Check serum osm 1hr after mannitol.
   -          Follow post-procedure protocol provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] (copy
   in chart).
   -          Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   -          Decrease NAC to 6mg/kg/hr, in case that is having unexpected
   effects on mental status.
   -          Minimize stimulation of patient.
   # Acetaminophen-induced hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and
   AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver
   enzymes have been trending downward since then, and now even T bili is
   trending down. AFP was checked per toxicology and is high (77),
   indicating regeneration of liver. Acetaminophen level falling (7.5
   today).
   - Continue following daily acetaminophen levels.
   - Continue NAC at lower dose, as above.
   -          Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q 4 hours.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily.
   - Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give juice if sugar is low and she is
   awake enough to take POs.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # Respiratory failure: Respiratory failure is linked to decline in
   mental status.
   -          Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   -          Hyperventilate to keep PCO2 at 30.
   -          HOB elevated 30 degrees
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection. However, vanc currently held for supertherapeutic level.
   # ARF: Cr now falling, while on CVVH.
   -          Switch from CVVH to ultrafiltration with goal of removing
   100cc more than amount of mannitol given.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   # Abdominal distention and pain: Abdominal distention slightly
   decreased today. Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution
   from ileus and from small ascited.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion. Could be partially dilutional, as she is net
   positive 14L for her length of stay.
   -          Follow q4h hcts.
   -          Transfusing for hct < 25.
   # Leukocytosis: Improving steadily.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          f/u cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   # Depression: Difficult to assess today, as she is intubated and
   sedated.
   -          Communicate with psych regarding future treatment for
   depression, including inpatient hospitalization once she
s medically
   stable.
   # Positive U/A: However urine cx [**8-19**] was negative.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosyn) will cover UTI.
   # s/p C-section complicated by likely pre-ecclampsia: Phanensteil
   incision is clean, without exudate or erythema. No sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring abdominal incision for sign of infection.
   - Continue monitoring breasts for mastitis/breast engorgement. Treat
   breast engorgement with ice and compression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose and a recent emergency C-section for pre-eclampsia. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). An ICP monitor will be placed, and measures will be taken to lower ICP, including hyperventilation and mannitol administration.

2. Acetaminophen-induced hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes have peaked but are now trending downward, indicating some recovery. Acetaminophen levels are falling, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy will continue at a lower dose.

3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Further labs are ordered to investigate the cause of the anion gap metabolic acidosis. The underlying etiology remains unclear.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is linked to her decline in mental status. She will be kept intubated until her mental status clears. Hyperventilation will be maintained to keep the PCO2 at 30, and her head of bed (HOB) will be elevated to 30 degrees.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is falling while on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVV"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to elevated ICP. Underlying
   etiology of elevated ICP remains unclear. Likely a sequella of liver
   damage, however time course is later than expected. Per OB/GYN, not
   likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or other post-partum syndrome
   given that change in mental status occurred more than 48 hours after
   delivery. Could be due to additional ingestion, but seems unlikely from
   experience with patient as well as 24-hour sitter and frequent visits
   from family and hospital staff. Could be due to unrelated infectious or
   other process, but this is very unlikely.
   -               Hepatology following.
   -               Neurology following.
   -               OB/GYN consult today for comment upon whether
   post-partum syndrome could be contributing to altered mental status.
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor.
   -               EEG this AM.
   -               Talk to neuro about whether pentobarbital should be
   increased or decreased.
   -               Arctic Sun protocol to cool pt to 33 degrees, per
   protocol.
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pH of 7.45.
   -               Increase mannitol to as high as 50g q6h with osm goal
   of 325. Check serum osm 1hr after mannitol.
   -               Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP
   drip, additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -               Continue levofed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   -               D/c NAC today, pending hepatology agreement, given that
   AST and ALT are below 1000 and acetaminophen is undetectable.
   -               Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give D50 for hypoglycemia.
   -               Continue PO lactulose.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient.
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver is recovering well, however new asterixis flap
   on [**8-23**] in combination with decline in mental status raises suspicion
   for ongoing late effects of the liver failure.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily.
   # Respiratory failure: Respiratory failure is linked to decline in
   mental status.
   -          Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -          Hyperventilate to keep pH at 7.45.
   -          HOB elevated 30 degrees
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection.
    # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Could be partially due to citrate
   given during dialysis.
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   -          Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   # Abdominal distention: Abdominal distention slightly decreased today.
   Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution from ileus and
   from small ascites.
   - Repeat abdominal US today.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   - Add cipro to double cover for any potential utero-vaginal infection.
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion. Could be partially dilutional, as she is
   significantly net positive for her length of stay.
   -          Follow q4h hcts.
   -          Transfusing for hct < 25.
   # Leukocytosis: Increased today after previous decline. Differential
   shows bandemia. Pt became febrile to 100.5 for the first time during
   her stay. Could represent infection (intracranial, pulmonary,
   intraabdominal, blood) versus inflammation.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          Send sputum, stool, and urine gram stain and cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   - Treat empirically for c. diff. with Flagyl.
   - Add cipro for double coverage of possible uterine infection.
   # Depression: Difficult to assess today, as she is intubated and
   sedated.
   # s/p C-section: Phanensteil incision is clean, without exudate or
   erythema. Breasts not engorged.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds at 10cc/hr.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, who is now pregnant and underwent an emergent cesarean section. She presents with altered mental status, likely due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and has several medical complications including hepatic failure, respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, anemia, leukocytosis, and possible abdominal distention.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to elevated ICP. The underlying cause of the elevated ICP is unclear, but it is suspected to be a sequela of liver damage. Other potential causes such as pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or post-partum syndrome have been ruled out.

2. Hepatic failure: The patient experienced severe liver damage due to the acetaminophen overdose, as evidenced by extremely high liver enzymes (ALT = 8370 and AST = [Numeric Identifier 373]) and an elevated INR of 8.1. However, liver enzymes have been trending downward since then, and the acetaminophen level is now undetectable, indicating potential recovery. Nonetheless, asterixis flap observed on [**8-23**] raises suspicion for ongoing late effects of liver failure.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is linked"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequella of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated infectious
   (viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Started pentobarb coma
   on [**8-24**].  Relisted for liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt
   would most likely go for transplant.  However, situation is complicated
   by both pentobarb coma as well as decreased body temp
 coagulopathy.
   Will consider stopping either the pentobarb or the arctic sun protocol
   today.
   -               Hepatology following.
   -               Neurology following- working on getting continuous EEG
   monitor.  Need today in order to monitor depth of burst suppression
   -               OB/GYN following
   -               Transplant surgery following- would like to d/c
   pentobarb coma
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor.
   -               Arctic Sun protocol to cool pt to 33 degrees.  Unclear
   as to how long pt will need to stay hypothermic.  Pt will most likely
   rewarm passively.
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pH of 7.45.
   -               Increase mannitol to 50g q6h prn osm< 325.   Change
   diasylate to hypertonic solution.  Can add D10 to this for additional
   dextrose to aid in hypoglycemia.
   -               Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP
   drip, additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -               Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   -               Consider d/c NAC today, pending hepatology agreement,
   given that AST and ALT are below 1000 and acetaminophen is
   undetectable.
   -               Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give D50 for hypoglycemia.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient, but need to attempt to
   obtain sputum culture today to work up leukocytosis
   -               Trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial
   translocation
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver is recovering well, however new asterixis flap
   on [**8-23**] in combination with elevated ICP raises suspicion for ongoing
   late effects of the liver failure.   Pt also continues to be
   hypoglycemic which is concerning for poor liver function.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pH at 7.45.
   - HOB elevated 30 degrees

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She was found to be 38 weeks pregnant and underwent an emergent C-section. The patient's current condition includes elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), hepatic failure, respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, abdominal distention, anemia, leukocytosis, and a history of a suicide attempt. She is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions to manage her conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Elevated ICP: The patient has a history of elevated ICP, which is likely a sequelae of liver damage. This can lead to further neurological complications if not managed properly.
2. Hepatic failure: Although the patient's liver enzymes have been trending downward, there is still a concern for ongoing liver failure. This can result in worsening coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has an ongoing anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could be due to citrate given during dialysis or other causes. Monitoring and management of acid-base balance is crucial.
5. Acute kidney injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to elevated ICP. Underlying
   etiology of elevated ICP remains unclear. Likely a sequella of liver
   damage, however time course is later than expected. Per OB/GYN, not
   likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or other post-partum syndrome
   given that change in mental status occurred more than 48 hours after
   delivery. Could be due to additional ingestion, but seems unlikely from
   experience with patient as well as 24-hour sitter and frequent visits
   from family and hospital staff. Could be due to unrelated infectious or
   other process, but this is very unlikely.
   -               Hepatology following.
   -               Neurology following.
   -               OB/GYN consult today for comment upon whether
   post-partum syndrome could be contributing to altered mental status.
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor.
   -               EEG this AM.
   -               Talk to neuro about whether pentobarbital should be
   increased or decreased.
   -               Arctic Sun protocol to cool pt to 33 degrees, per
   protocol.
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pH of 7.45.
   -               Increase mannitol to as high as 50g q6h with osm goal
   of 325. Check serum osm 1hr after mannitol.
   -               Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP
   drip, additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -               Continue levofed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Continue following lactate and anion gap.
   -               D/c NAC today, pending hepatology agreement, given that
   AST and ALT are below 1000 and acetaminophen is undetectable.
   -               Continue q2h fingersticks.  Give D50 for hypoglycemia.
   -               Continue PO lactulose.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient.
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver is recovering well, however new asterixis flap
   on [**8-23**] in combination with decline in mental status raises suspicion
   for ongoing late effects of the liver failure.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K 5mg PO daily.
   # Respiratory failure: Respiratory failure is linked to decline in
   mental status.
   -          Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -          Hyperventilate to keep pH at 7.45.
   -          HOB elevated 30 degrees
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn for any present or potential
   infection.
    # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Could be partially due to citrate
   given during dialysis.
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   -          Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage.
   -          Continue q2h FSBG and repletion with amps of D50.
   # Abdominal distention: Abdominal distention slightly decreased today.
   Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution from ileus and
   from small ascites.
   - Repeat abdominal US today.
   -          Continue vancomycin and zosyn until labs stabilize and cxs
   come back negative.
   - Add cipro to double cover for any potential utero-vaginal infection.
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion. Could be partially dilutional, as she is
   significantly net positive for her length of stay.
   -          Follow q4h hcts.
   -          Transfusing for hct < 25.
   # Leukocytosis: Increased today after previous decline. Differential
   shows bandemia. Pt became febrile to 100.5 for the first time during
   her stay. Could represent infection (intracranial, pulmonary,
   intraabdominal, blood) versus inflammation.
   -          Continue to follow WBC.
   -          Send sputum, stool, and urine gram stain and cultures.
   -          Continue vanc and zosyn until labs stabilize and cultures
   come back negative.
   - Treat empirically for c. diff. with Flagyl.
   - Add cipro for double coverage of possible uterine infection.
   # Depression: Difficult to assess today, as she is intubated and
   sedated.
   # s/p C-section: Phanensteil incision is clean, without exudate or
   erythema. Breasts not engorged.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's condition requires continuous monitoring and management of various parameters such as pentobarb coma levels, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and electrolyte balance. The patient has been receiving multiple blood transfusions and intravenous medications including antibiotics. There are concerns about the patient's nutritional status, glycemic control, and risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, kidney function, and electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications like pulmonary embolism.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and overall prognosis.

3. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. The combination of immunosuppression, invasive lines, and prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The elevated liver enzymes and low albumin level suggest possible liver dysfunction, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition"

   24 Hour Events:
   Required one bag of platelets for platelets 64. Went up to 105 after
   but has slowly trended down after.
   BGTs continued to run low on d20w at 20mL/hr. Went up to 30mL/hr then
   40mL/hr and now in 80s consistently
   Cooling blanket was turned off and temp rose appropriately. ICP
   remained <20.
   Neuro came to place EEG
   Liver recommended conituning Vit K, checking C.Diff, and stopping nac
   when INR <2 for one day without FFP.
   Started on hypertonic saline for fluids (plus the d20W) to try to keep
   osm up but no change in sodium or osm.
   As ICP was normal did not increase dose of mannitol for osm ~310.

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequella of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated infectious
   (viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Started pentobarb coma
   on [**8-24**].  Relisted for liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt
   would most likely go for transplant.  However, situation is complicated
   by both pentobarb coma as well as decreased body temp
 coagulopathy.
   Stopped the artic sun protocol and maintained ICPs <20 (~12).
   -               Neurology following- has continuous EEG monitor.  No
   bursts per neuron.
   -               OB/GYN following
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor.
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pH of 7.45.
   -               Mannitol to 50g q6h prn osm< 325.
   -               Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient, but need to attempt to
   obtain sputum culture today to work up leukocytosis
   -               Will stop the pentobarb drip today and watch ICPs. If
   trend up will restart drip
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver is recovering well, however new asterixis flap
   on [**8-23**] in combination with elevated ICP raises suspicion for ongoing
   late effects of the liver failure.   Pt also continues to be
   hypoglycemic which is concerning for poor liver function.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   -               Hepatology following.
   -               Transplant surgery following
   -               Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP
   drip, additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -               Consider d/c NAC today, pending hepatology agreement,
   given that AST and ALT are below 1000 and acetaminophen is
   undetectable.  Hepatology will leave recs to d/c nac when pt
s INR <2
   without FFP for 24h.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pH at 7.45 PCO2 30.
   - HOB elevated 30 degrees
   # Leukocytosis: Differential shows bandemia. New GNR in sputum. ?PSA vs
   resistant klebsiella or actinobacter species since on vanc/zosyn and
   continues with increasing leukocytosis
   - ID consult today. ?should we broaden coverage to cover resistant GNRs
   - Will have pan-CT scan today to look for infection around ICP probe,
   Abdominal infection/megacolon, and lung pathology.
   - Continue to follow WBC.
   - Follow up c.diff toxins as well as urine/blood cultures
   -  Continue vanc, zosyn.  Added cipro, flagyl, and fluconazole
   - Check vanc trough level
    # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Could be partially due to citrate
   given during dialysis.
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   -          Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage and
   failed gluconeogenesis.
   -               Continue q1h FSBG and repletion with D20W at 40mL/hour.
   Will increase rate to 60 since sugars are still not >70.
   -               Will change replacement fluid for CVVH to D5 to keep
   sugars up.
   # Abdominal distention: Abdominal distention slightly decreased today.
   Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution from ileus and
   from small ascites..  Continue to monitor.
   -               Tried trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial
   translocation but failed b/c high residuals
   -               Concerned for C.Diff but has not stooled so can
t test.
   -               Treating empirically with flagyl
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion
   -          Follow q4h hcts.
   -          Transfusing for hct < 25.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient has been experiencing increased ICP, which is likely a sequelae of liver damage. The time course is later than expected, and it may be due to unrelated infectious or other processes. The patient has been started on pentobarb coma and is being closely monitored.

2. Hepatic failure: The patient initially presented with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. Liver enzymes peaked at very high levels, but have been trending downward since then. However, the presence of asterixis flap raises suspicion for ongoing late effects of liver failure. The patient will continue to be monitored closely.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated while in pentobarb coma. It is planned to keep the patient intubated until mental status clears. The respiratory status will be closely monitored, and hyperventilation will be maintained to keep pH at 7.45 PCO2 30.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, and there is a new GNR in the sputum. There is a concern for possible PSA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), resistant klebsiella, or actinobacter species infection. An ID consult has been ordered, and broad coverage may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman admitted with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She was found to be 38 weeks pregnant and underwent an emergent C-section. The patient's medical history includes elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), hepatic failure, respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, abdominal distention, anemia, leukocytosis, and a suicide attempt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated ICP: The patient has a history of elevated ICP, which can be caused by liver damage. It is important to monitor and manage ICP closely to prevent further complications.
2. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes have been trending downward since admission, indicating recovery. However, new symptoms such as asterixis flap and hypoglycemia raise concerns for ongoing late effects of liver failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of respiratory function are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This condition may be partially due to citrate given during dialysis. Close monitoring of laboratory values and acid-base balance is required.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient is on ultrafiltration to manage fluid balance and renal function. Monitoring of creatinine levels and urine output is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of severe traumatic brain injury. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The patient's medical team has been closely monitoring various vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support. 

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The blood tests also indicate abnormal liver function tests, including elevated ALT and AST levels. Other lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), lactate, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) levels.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuous monitoring in the ICU, administration of IV fluids, antibiotics, and medications to manage the patient's condition. The medical team is also closely monitoring the patient's nutritional status and maintaining glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and infections due to the invasive lines and tubes. The patient's low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes are concerning and require further evaluation."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   In the AM it was decided to lighten sedation and see how pt does. She
   was reduced to 0.5mg/kg/hr of pentobarb.
   Pt was then taken to CT while her CVVH filter was being changed. CT
   showed no acute process to explain her condition - final read pending.
   While at CT or on the way back it was noted that the R pupil was
   dilated. ICP rose to >20.
   Given elevated ICP and pupillary finding pt was restarted on
   1.0mg/kg/hr pentobarb and her ICP slowly normalized.
   Her ICP bold was adjusted by neurosurgery for concern that it was not
   functioning properly.
   Given her ongoign hypoglycemia her CVVH fluid was changed to have D5.
   She was also continued on a D20 drip. Her blood sugard were elevaved
   >400. The D20 drip was stopped. Her sugars remained in the 300s. Renal
   adjusted her CVVH fluid and then ultimately discontinued the D5. She
   was restarted on the D20 drip and titrated to blood glucose levels -
   around 60mL/hr
   Her K and Pi were difficult to manage. She was maxed out on replacement
   scales and still was hypokalemic and hypophosphatemic. Renal adjusted
   her CVVH and her electrolytes were easier to control.
   Around 1am it was noted that her L pupil was dilated and poorly
   responssive to light. The right pupil was smaller and responssive.
   Neuro, hepatology, and neurosurgery were called. Ultimately in
   discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] it was decided to try the Artic Sun protocol
   again with a goal core temp of 34. On this protocol her pupils
   normalized by around 5am, but not before the R pupil was noted to be
   dilated around 3am.
   Her INR has remained <2.0 for the past 24 hrs
   NAC was continued at a reduced dose of ?????
   ID was consulted and asked for repeat cultures and said that an LP may

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequella of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated infectious
   (viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Started pentobarb coma
   on [**8-24**].  Relisted for liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt
   would most likely go for transplant.  However, situation is complicated
   by both pentobarb coma as well as decreased body temp
 coagulopathy.
   Stopped the artic sun protocol and maintained ICPs <20 (~12).
   -               Neurology following- has continuous EEG monitor.  No
   bursts per neuron.
   -               OB/GYN following
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor.
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pCO2 of 30.
   -               Mannitol to 50g q6h prn osm< 325.
   -               Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient, but need to attempt to
   obtain sputum culture today to work up leukocytosis
   -               Will continue pentobarb drip
   -               Will continue Artic Sun protocol to goal temp of 34 for
   now
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver is recovering well, however new asterixis flap
   on [**8-23**] in combination with elevated ICP raises suspicion for ongoing
   late effects of the liver failure.   Pt also continues to be
   hypoglycemic which is concerning for poor liver function.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   -               Hepatology following.
   -               Transplant surgery following
   -               Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP
   drip, additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -               Consider d/c NAC today, pending hepatology agreement,
   given that AST and ALT are below 1000 and acetaminophen is
   undetectable.  Hepatology will leave recs to d/c nac when pt
s INR <2
   without FFP for 24h.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pCO2 = 30.
   - HOB elevated 30 degrees
   # Leukocytosis: Differential shows bandemia. New GNR in sputum. ?PSA vs
   resistant klebsiella or actinobacter species since on vanc/zosyn and
   continues with increasing leukocytosis
   - ID consult today. ?should we broaden coverage to cover resistant GNRs
   - Will have pan-CT scan today to look for infection around ICP probe,
   Abdominal infection/megacolon, and lung pathology.
   - Continue to follow WBC.
   - Follow up c.diff toxins as well as urine/blood cultures
   -  Continue vanc, zosyn, cipro, flagyl, and fluconazole
   - Check vanc trough level
    - ID consulting and input appreciated. Recommend repeat cultures and
   possible LP
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Could be partially due to citrate given
   during dialysis.
   -          F/u labs ordered per hepatology.
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   -          Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   -          Continue to follow Cr.
   -          Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage and
   failed gluconeogenesis.
   -               Continue q1h FSBG and repletion with D20W titrated to
   appropriate glucose level
   # Abdominal distention: Abdominal distention slightly decreased today.
   Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution from ileus and
   from small ascites..  Continue to monitor.
   -               Tried trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial
   translocation but failed b/c high residuals
   -               Concerned for C.Diff but has not stooled so can
t test.
   -               Treating empirically with flagyl
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is elevated, which could be a result of liver damage. This is concerning as it may lead to further neurological complications. The plan includes maintaining ICPs below 20 through hyperventilation, mannitol administration, and keeping the head of bed elevated at 30 degrees.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient had significantly elevated liver enzymes, but they have been trending downward since the peak on August 21st. Acetaminophen levels are now undetectable, indicating recovery of the liver. However, the presence of asterixis flap raises suspicion for ongoing late effects of liver failure. Monitoring of INR, PT, PTT, electrolytes, and CBC every three hours is planned to ensure liver function. Vitamin K supplementation and hepatology follow-up are also recommended.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated while in a pentobarb coma. Intubation will be continued until her mental status clears. Hyperventilation will be maintained to keep pCO2 at 30, and the head of bed will be elevated at 30 degrees.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   In the AM it was decided to lighten sedation and see how pt does. She
   was reduced to 0.5mg/kg/hr of pentobarb.
   Pt was then taken to CT while her CVVH filter was being changed. CT
   showed no acute process to explain her condition - final read pending.
   While at CT or on the way back it was noted that the R pupil was
   dilated. ICP rose to >20.
   Given elevated ICP and pupillary finding pt was restarted on
   1.0mg/kg/hr pentobarb and her ICP slowly normalized.
   Her ICP bold was adjusted by neurosurgery for concern that it was not
   functioning properly.
   Given her ongoign hypoglycemia her CVVH fluid was changed to have D5.
   She was also continued on a D20 drip. Her blood sugard were elevaved
   >400. The D20 drip was stopped. Her sugars remained in the 300s. Renal
   adjusted her CVVH fluid and then ultimately discontinued the D5. She
   was restarted on the D20 drip and titrated to blood glucose levels -
   around 60mL/hr
   Her K and Pi were difficult to manage. She was maxed out on replacement
   scales and still was hypokalemic and hypophosphatemic. Renal adjusted
   her CVVH and her electrolytes were easier to control.
   Around 1am it was noted that her L pupil was dilated and poorly
   responssive to light. The right pupil was smaller and responssive.
   Neuro, hepatology, and neurosurgery were called. Ultimately in
   discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] it was decided to try the Artic Sun protocol
   again with a goal core temp of 34. On this protocol her pupils
   normalized by around 5am, but not before the R pupil was noted to be
   dilated around 3am.
   Her INR has remained <2.0 for the past 24 hrs
   NAC was continued at a reduced dose of 602mg/hr
   ID was consulted and asked for repeat cultures and said that an LP may

   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt. Found to be 38w
   pregnant and is s/p emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequella of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated infectious
   (viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Started pentobarb coma
   on [**8-24**].  Relisted for liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt
   would most likely go for transplant.
   -               Neurology following- has continuous EEG monitor.  No
   bursts per neuron.
   -               OB/GYN following
   -               Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor with ICP now
   [**7-6**]
   -               Hyperventilate to goal pCO2 of 30.
   -               Mannitol to 50mg q6h prn to osm 320 to 325.
   -               Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   -               Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   -               Minimize stimulation of patient, but need to attempt to
   obtain sputum culture today to work up leukocytosis
   -               Will continue pentobarb drip at 1mg/kg/min
   -               Will continue Artic Sun protocol to goal temp of 34 for
   now
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Therefore,
   appears as though liver may be recovering, however hypoglycemia, new
   asterixis flap on [**8-23**], and ICP raises suspicion for ongoing late
   effects of the liver failure.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   - Hepatology following.
   - Transplant surgery following
   - Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP drip,
   additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -  Continue NAC, pending hepatology agreement, given that AST and ALT
   are below 1000 and acetaminophen is undetectable.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pCO2 = 30.
   - HOB elevated 30 degrees
   # Leukocytosis: Differential shows bandemia. New GNR in sputum. ?PSA vs

   - Follow up c.diff toxins if stooling
   - F/U U and BCx
   -  Continue vanc, zosyn, cipro, flagyl, and fluconazole
   - Check vanc trough level
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   - Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow Cr.
   - Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage and
   failed gluconeogenesis.
   - Continue q1h FSBG and repletion with D20W titrated to appropriate
   glucose level
   # Abdominal distention: Abdominal distention slightly decreased today.
   Cause is still unclear, but likely some contribution from ileus and
   from small ascites..  Continue to monitor.
   - Tried trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial translocation
   but failed b/c high residuals
   - Concerned for C.Diff but has not stooled so can
t test.
   - Treating empirically with flagyl
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion
   - Follow q4h hcts.
   - transfusing for hct < 25.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman who was admitted with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She is also 38 weeks pregnant and had an emergent Caesarian section. The patient has multiple medical complications including elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), hepatic failure, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), hypoglycemia, anemia, and abdominal distention.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Increased risk of brain injury due to the elevated ICP.
2. Liver transplantation may be required due to the severity of hepatic failure.
3. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the respiratory failure.
4. Infection may progress despite antibiotic treatment due to leukocytosis.
5. ARF may worsen and require dialysis.
6. Hypoglycemia may continue to occur, potentially leading to further complications.
7. Anemia may worsen without appropriate treatment.
8. Abdominal distention may indicate ongoing ileus or ascites, which can lead to further complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate interventions to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She was also found to be 38 weeks pregnant and underwent an emergent Caesarian section. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient has likely developed elevated ICP, which could be a sequela of liver damage. The time course is later than expected, but it is not clear if this is related to pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or other post-partum syndrome. The patient has been listed for liver transplantation.

2. Pentobarbital coma: The patient was started on pentobarbital coma to reduce cerebral metabolic rate and control ICP. However, attempts to lighten sedation resulted in re-elevation of ICP and subsequent dilation of pupils. Therefore, pentobarbital coma was restarted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/hr.

3. Arctic sun protocol: The patient underwent the Arctic sun protocol, which involves hypothermia therapy. This was restarted when the patient's right then left pupil, and then right again became dilated. The goal temperature is set at 34 degrees Celsius.

4. Neurological monitoring: The patient has continuous EEG monitoring. There are no bursts per neurologist. Continuous ICP monitoring is also being performed, with the current ICP reading of 7"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt.  AT OSH, was found
   to be 38w pregnant and underwent emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequela of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated
   infectious(viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Relisted for
   liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt would most likely go
   for transplant.
   - Aniscoria.  Right pupil has dilated again.  Needs head CT (must
   remove EEG leads).  Will paralyze pt prior to scan.  Also, will give
   extra dose of mannitol.
   - Pentobarb coma:  Started on [**8-24**] and attempted to lighten sedation on
   [**8-27**].  However, pt's ICP re-elev and pupils subsequently dilated.
   Restarted pentobarb coma on [**8-27**].  Currently at 1mg/kg/hr.
   - Arctic sun protocol- Had been discontinued but was restarted on
   8/31when right then left pupil then right again became dilated.  Goal
   temp of 34.
   - Neurology following- has continuous EEG monitor.  No bursts per
   neuro.
   - OB/GYN consulted- do not believe current symptoms to be a sequelae of
   pregnancy
   - Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor with ICP now [**7-6**]
   - Hyperventilate to goal pCO2 of 30.
   - Mannitol to 50mg q6h prn to osm 320 to 325.  Sporadically, osm < 315,
   and will infuse an additional 25g of mannitol
   - Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   - Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   - Minimize stimulation of patient
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Was thought
   that liver was improving, however, she then developed elevated ICP as
   well as hypoglycemia, both concerning for worsening liver function. INR
   continues to be elevated.   She is currently re-listed for transplant.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   - Hepatology following.
   - Transplant surgery following
   - Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP drip,
   additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -  Continue NAC, pending hepatology agreement, given that AST and ALT
   are below 1000 and acetaminophen is undetectable.  NAC was reduced to
   602mg/hr.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pCO2 = 30.
   # Leukocytosis w/ bandemia: New GNR in sputum. ?PSA vs resistant
   klebsiella or actinobacter species since on vanc/zosyn and continues
   with increasing leukocytosis
   - ID consult recommend cultures plus LP and para if feasible.  However,
   pt is too unstable for an LP.  Continuing to hold on paracentesis for
   now.
   - PanCT yesterday non-informative
   - Continue to follow WBC.
   - Follow up c.diff toxins if stooling
   - Re-[**Last Name (un) 415**] urine cultures on [**8-28**]
   - Continue vanc, zosyn, cipro, flagyl, and fluconazole
   - [**8-28**] vanc trough was 16.7
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   - CVVH filter required changing on [**8-27**].  At that time, it was decided
   to take the pt to CT scanner (read still pending).  While at CT, her
   pupils dilated and ICP rose.
   - Given her continued hypoglycemia, her CVVH fluid was changed to D5
   but was then discontinued when her sugars were elevated.
   - Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow Cr
   - Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage and
   failed gluconeogenesis.
   - CVH fluid is D5.  Pt continued to get a D20 drip and her blood sugars
   were elevated at >400.  The D20 was stopped but her sugars remained
   high.  Renal again adjusted her CVVH fluid, discontinuing the D5.
   Restarted the D20 drip and her sugars have leveled out.  Currently
   running at approx 60ml/hr.
   - Continue q1h FSBG and repletion with D20W titrated to appropriate
   glucose level
   # Abdominal distention:  Cause is still unclear, but likely some
   contribution from ileus and from small ascites. Continue to monitor.
   - Follow up final CT read
   - Bedside ultrasound on [**8-28**] showed continued small amount of ascites.
   - Tried trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial translocation
   but failed b/c high residuals
   - Concerned for C.Diff but has not stooled so can't test for toxin
   - Treating empirically with flagyl
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She is also pregnant and underwent an emergent Caesarian section. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), hepatic failure, respiratory failure, leukocytosis with bandemia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypoglycemia, abdominal distention, anemia, and a suicide attempt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated ICP: The patient's ICP has been elevated, which can lead to brain herniation and death if not managed promptly.
2. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate severe hepatic injury, which can result in multiorgan dysfunction and failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Leukocytosis with Bandemia: The presence of leukocytosis with bandemia suggests a bacterial infection, which may require appropriate antibiotic therapy and further investigation.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not treated appropriately.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological damage and other complications if not managed promptly.
7. Abdominal Distention: The cause"

","The patient is a 22-year-old woman admitted with fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose. She was also found to be 38 weeks pregnant and underwent an emergent Caesarian section. The patient's condition has been discussed, and decisions regarding weaning pentobarbital per neuro recommendations have been made. There are concerns about an infected hematoma, and ID recommendations include stopping cipro and tapping the belly. Imaging studies such as head CT and MRI have shown normal to improved results.

The patient's vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring are stable, with no significant fluid balance issues. Respiratory support is in place, and ABG results indicate a pH of 7.16, indicating acidosis. Oxygenation is satisfactory with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 1023. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments.

Lab results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), abnormal coagulation profile (PTT), elevated bilirubin levels, and altered electrolyte levels (low sodium and potassium). Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings within normal range and others elevated. Other lab results indicate possible liver injury and dysfunction.

The patient's care plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia. The patient is expected to undergo a liver transplant overnight, and her care will be transferred"

   Assessment and Plan
   22 year old woman with admitted with fulminant hepatic failure
   following acetaminophen overdose as suicide attempt.  AT OSH, was found
   to be 38w pregnant and underwent emergent Caesarian section.
   # Elevated ICP:
   Likely a sequela of liver damage, however time course is later than
   expected. Per OB/GYN, not likely to be due to pre-eclampsia, HELLP, or
   other post-partum syndrome.  Could be due to unrelated
   infectious(viral?) or other process, but this is unlikely. Relisted for
   liver on [**8-24**] and if liver becomes available pt would most likely go
   for transplant.
   - Aniscoria.  Right pupil has dilated again.  Needs head CT (must
   remove EEG leads).  Will paralyze pt prior to scan.  Also, will give
   extra dose of mannitol.
   - Pentobarb coma:  Started on [**8-24**] and attempted to lighten sedation on
   [**8-27**].  However, pt's ICP re-elev and pupils subsequently dilated.
   Restarted pentobarb coma on [**8-27**].  Currently at 1mg/kg/hr.
   - Arctic sun protocol- Had been discontinued but was restarted on
   8/31when right then left pupil then right again became dilated.  Goal
   temp of 34.
   - Neurology following- has continuous EEG monitor.  No bursts per
   neuro.
   - OB/GYN consulted- do not believe current symptoms to be a sequelae of
   pregnancy
   - Continuous ICP monitoring via ICP monitor with ICP now [**7-6**]
   - Hyperventilate to goal pCO2 of 30.
   - Mannitol to 50mg q6h prn to osm 320 to 325.  Sporadically, osm < 315,
   and will infuse an additional 25g of mannitol
   - Continue levophed to keep CPP above 70.
   - Elevated HOB 30 degrees.
   - Minimize stimulation of patient
   # Hepatic failure: LFTs peaked at ALT = 8370 and AST = [**Numeric Identifier 373**] at 3am on
   [**8-21**] and INR = 8.1 at 9:22pm on [**8-20**]. Liver enzymes have been trending
   downward since then. Acetaminophen level now undetectable. Was thought
   that liver was improving, however, she then developed elevated ICP as
   well as hypoglycemia, both concerning for worsening liver function. INR
   continues to be elevated.   She is currently re-listed for transplant.
   - Plan as above, for altered mental status.
   - Vitamin K
   - Hepatology following.
   - Transplant surgery following
   - Check INR, PT, PTT, electrolyes, CBC q3hours. Use FFP drip,
   additional platelets, and additional cryoprecipitate to keep INR,
   platelets and fibrinogen above goals.
   -  Continue NAC, pending hepatology agreement, given that AST and ALT
   are below 1000 and acetaminophen is undetectable.  NAC was reduced to
   602mg/hr.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated while in pentobarb coma.
   - Keep pt intubated until mental status clears.
   - Continue albuterol nebs and periodic suctioning.
   -  Hyperventilate to keep pCO2 = 30.
   # Leukocytosis w/ bandemia: New GNR in sputum. ?PSA vs resistant
   klebsiella or actinobacter species since on vanc/zosyn and continues
   with increasing leukocytosis
   - ID consult recommend cultures plus LP and para if feasible.  However,
   pt is too unstable for an LP.  Continuing to hold on paracentesis for
   now.
   - PanCT yesterday non-informative
   - Continue to follow WBC.
   - Follow up c.diff toxins if stooling
   - Re-[**Last Name (un) 415**] urine cultures on [**8-28**]
   - Continue vanc, zosyn, cipro, flagyl, and fluconazole
   - [**8-28**] vanc trough was 16.7
   # ARF: Pt currently on ultrafiltration.
   - CVVH filter required changing on [**8-27**].  At that time, it was decided
   to take the pt to CT scanner (read still pending).  While at CT, her
   pupils dilated and ICP rose.
   - Given her continued hypoglycemia, her CVVH fluid was changed to D5
   but was then discontinued when her sugars were elevated.
   - Renal following closely.
   - Goal of net fluid balance -50cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow Cr
   - Continue to follow UOP.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely a sequelae of tylenol-induced hepatic damage and
   failed gluconeogenesis.
   - CVH fluid is D5.  Pt continued to get a D20 drip and her blood sugars
   were elevated at >400.  The D20 was stopped but her sugars remained
   high.  Renal again adjusted her CVVH fluid, discontinuing the D5.
   Restarted the D20 drip and her sugars have leveled out.  Currently
   running at approx 60ml/hr.
   - Continue q1h FSBG and repletion with D20W titrated to appropriate
   glucose level
   # Abdominal distention:  Cause is still unclear, but likely some
   contribution from ileus and from small ascites. Continue to monitor.
   - Follow up final CT read
   - Bedside ultrasound on [**8-28**] showed continued small amount of ascites.
   - Tried trophic feeds to decrease likelihood of bacterial translocation
   but failed b/c high residuals
   - Concerned for C.Diff but has not stooled so can't test for toxin
   - Treating empirically with flagyl
   # Anemia: No evidence for hemolysis based on smear, per hematology.
   However, pt has continued to have less than expected hct response
   following transfusion
   - Follow q4h hcts.
   - transfusing for hct < 25.
   - Most likely anemia of inflammation
   # FEN: Currently holding on TPN, as this would increase her risk for
   infection.
   # Suicide attempt: psych and social work following.
   # s/p C-section: Pfannensteil incision C, D, I.  Infant in pt's
   parents' custody.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of fulminant hepatic failure following an acetaminophen overdose, which was attempted as a suicide. She is also 38 weeks pregnant and underwent an emergency cesarean section. The patient's current conditions include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), respiratory failure requiring intubation, hepatic failure with elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis with bandemia, acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), hypoglycemia, abdominal distention, anemia, and a history of a suicide attempt. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) - The patient has symptoms such as anisocoria (unequal pupil size) and dilated right pupil, which can be indicative of increased ICP. If left untreated, this can lead to further neurological complications, including brain herniation.

2. Infection - The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia and a new gram-negative rod in her sputum culture. This suggests the possibility of an infection. If not appropriately managed, the infection can progress and cause sepsis, leading to multiple organ dysfunction.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for CVVH. If not properly"
