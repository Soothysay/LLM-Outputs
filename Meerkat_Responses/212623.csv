","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, who was admitted to the ICU for hyperglycemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/64 to 156/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving an insulin drip and various medications for other conditions such as asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes. If not managed properly, it can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
2. Infection: The cloudy urine and elevated white blood cell count may suggest a urinary tract infection. This should be monitored and treated promptly to prevent it from progressing to a more severe infection.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous heparin have been initiated, but close monitoring is essential.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Appropriate measures to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, chest pain, and spinal stenosis. He presented with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for 2-3 weeks, hyperglycemia, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to needing an insulin infusion. The patient's blood sugar levels have been consistently high, with readings over 400. There is concern for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Insulin gtt at 40U/hr was started, along with receiving 80U of glargine. The patient's fasting blood sugar (FS) is now 150. 

The patient's chest pain etiology is unclear, but it has been ruled out for myocardial infarction (MI). The pain is pleuritic, suggesting possible lung pathology such as pulmonary embolism (PE) or pneumonia (PNA). PE is a possibility due to sinus tachycardia and elevated D-dimer levels. The V-Q scan was unable to be completed. 

The patient is currently experiencing an asthma exacerbation, with decreased peak flow and poor air movement on examination. He has a history of two previous intubations. A steroid burst of prednisone 30mg for 4 days was initiated. 

The patient also has poorly controlled"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hyperglycemia, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. The patient has a history of asthma, ineffective coping, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and allergies to iodine, codeine, metoclopramide, ketorolac, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and several medications. 

The patient is currently on an insulin drip for glycemic control and has elevated blood sugar levels. A V/Q scan is incomplete due to the patient's refusal, and there is a suspicion of pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/69 to 142/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,295 mL with outputs totaling 1,960 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,335 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results indicate high levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 30.9%, platelets (Plt) at 476 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.0 mg/dL, glucose at 436 mg/dL, and elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR, lactic acid, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of asthma, ineffective coping, diabetes mellitus type II, pleuritic chest pain, and dysphagia. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and mouth care. 

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual with hyperglycemia, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. They have a history of asthma, ineffective coping, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/69 to 142/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including insulin, antibiotics, and medications for their medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed properly.

2. Infection: The presence of antibiotics suggests that the patient may have an ongoing infection. In the ICU setting, infections can be challenging to control and may lead to sepsis or septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Pulmonary issues: The patient's shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain could indicate respiratory problems. Incomplete V/Q scan suggests possible pulmonary embolism or pneumonia. Proper diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, and other medical conditions. She presented with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for 2-3 weeks, associated with hyperglycemia. She was admitted to the MICU due to needing an insulin infusion. The patient has been experiencing agitation throughout the day, with two code purples, and has been verbally abusive to the staff. She has also threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA) but agreed to stay. The patient claimed that her friend is her husband, but the relationship is unclear. She refused to eat anything except ice cream and ginger ale. She transitioned off the drip and started on an insulin sliding scale. She underwent a barium swallow, which showed no gross abnormalities but raised concerns about decreased gastric emptying. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS): The patient has a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus, and her blood sugar levels have been consistently high (greater than 400) for the last 2-3 weeks. She requires an insulin infusion and monitoring for HHS. Other causes of severe hyperglycemia should also be considered, such as glucagonoma, although the patient is currently on steroids for an asthma exacerbation.

2. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has poorly controlled symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged woman with multiple medical conditions, including severe hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, ineffective coping, and constipation. She was admitted to the ICU for aggressive management of her hyperglycemia. The patient has been receiving insulin therapy, and her glucose levels have been fluctuating. She also has a history of gastroparesis, which was confirmed through a barium swallow study. Other notable findings include pleuritic chest pain, no evidence of pulmonary embolism on limited V/Q scan, and right lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Due to the patient's fluctuating blood glucose levels and history of diabetes mellitus type II, there is a risk of developing DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis.
2. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is on insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the V/Q scan did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism, the presence of right lower extremity edema raises concern for DVT. This condition can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism if left untreated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's wheez"
