   57 yo M with afib, right sided CHF presenting with dyspnea, increased
   LE swelling c/b BLE venous stasis breakdown s/p diuresis on the floor,
   now transferred to the ICU for AMS.
   .
   # AMS - Likely secondary to hypercarbia / hypoxia due to obesity
   hypoventilation and sleep apnea.  Could be occult infection but no
   clear source and intial BP upon transfer was with patient not lying
   flat, now improved.  Also after significant diuresis.  LE with
   significant erythema, but review of records reveals this has been a
   stable issue for months to years, no leukocytosis, no fever.  Could
   also be pulmonary source (trialing and not tolerating CPAP), urinary or
   intra-abdominal.  Could be med effect but no new sedating meds in last
   several days.  Urine tox / serum tox negative.
   - GPC in blood, started Daptomycin given Vancomycin allergy
   - Trial BiPAP
   - ABG if worsens
   - Goal O2 88-92%
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Panculture: urine, blood & obtain CXR
   - Monitor BP, hemodynamics; no e/o sepsis at this time
   - Nonfocal, holding CT Head at this time
   - No clear e/o infection, will not LP unless fails to clear
   .
   # Hypoxia - Likely multifactorial including some pulmonary edema (as
   evidenced on CXR), pulmonary hypertension.  No e/o PNA as is afebrile
   and without leukocytosis.  CXR concerning for LLL process though poor
   study given body habitus. Some component of volume overload. Has
   effusions and vascular congestion. no e/o PE on CTA.
   - Trial BiPAP; will need O2 via NC when not on BiPAP, goal O2 88-92%
   - Diurese as above, but holding for ?hypotension
   - Hold antibiotics for PNA unless further e/o infection
   - Pulmonary recs from floor, should resume following after leaving ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia - With pH consistent with chronic process.  Maybe some
   component of slight acute worsening, but mostly chronic.  Likely [**2-8**]
   OSA, obesity; minimal evidence of COPD on PFTs.
   - BiPAP given with repeat ABG revealing minimal change in CO2
   - Follow MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8565**], BiPAP as needed
   .
   # Right heart failure - Secondary to cor pulmonae from COPD/OSA. No
   significant evidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Echo showed normal
   EF, not major LV dysfunction and showed significant pHTN and TR. No
   improvement with nitric oxide, thus not starting sildenafil or CCB.
   Patient s/p right and left heart cath. No evidence of ASD. L heart cath
   negative for CAD. For aggressive diuresis, switched from Lasix 120mg IV
   BID to lasix 10mg/hr ggt also given Diamox to compensatate for
   metabolic alkalosis.
   - Upon transfer, will hold Lasix, Spironolactone & Diamoxx given
   concern for hypotension
   - PM lytes
   - Daily weights & fluid restriction
   - Low salt diet once more alert and able to safely take PO
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:  Patient was seen by pulmonary and
   vasculitis labs sent. During R heart cath, severe pHTN and no
   improvement with nitric oxide. Sleep study not tolerated because
   patient could not tolerate CPAP mask. PFTs are reflective of
   restrictive physiology from obesity. Sleep study data was analyzed and
   patient was given Adapt SV machine instead of CPAP since AHI 63 and
   desat to 58%. Settings of PEEP 10 max pressure support 15 + 2L O2,
   patient will take this machine home with him. All vasculitis labs
   negative. Nebs not needed since not bronchospastic picture and
   restrictive not obsructive physiology.
   - Holding diuresis
   - Pt should lie with head elevation due large abdomen
   - BiPAP trial now and QHS
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently not anticoagluated [**2-8**] massive GIB
   while on coumadin and Ciprofloxacin.  Rate controlled with metoprolol.
   No ASA due to h/o GIB.  In OMR, warfarin was briefly restarted but upon
   transfer is not on medication list.
   - clarify current anticoagulation with primary team
   - hold Metoprolol given bradycardia upon transfer, likely needs lower
   dose and other [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control should it be needed
   .
   # Anasarca:  Partially resolving, intially, grossly volume overloaded
   on exam, with ascites, BLE edema, and soft tissue edema in back and on
   abdomen. Also with bilateral crackles and likely effusions.  Initial
   etiologies considered included right heart failure, possibly secondary
   to left heart failure vs pulmonary HTN, OSA, or RV infarct. Not from
   liver synthetic dysfunction since albumin normal and not nephrotic
   syndrome since negative urinary protein.
   - Diursing since admission, hold for hypotension, but will restart as
   able
   .
   # Prurigo nodularis: Seen by Dermatology consult inpatient.
   - Per their recommendations, will continue atarax QHS, clobetasol 0.05%
   ointment [**Hospital1 **], capsaicin cream TID x 4 weeks, d/c neosporin, mupirocin
   Cream 2% 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] to open lesions / excoriations
   - f/u [**Hospital 8553**] clinic in 3 months
   .
   # Cardiac liver disease: Per intial team evaluation, patient has
   distended abdomen, minimal ascities, slightly elevated INR at 1.6,
   platlets normal, normal albumin so hepatic function is intact and there
   is not significant splenic platlet sequesteration. Etiology could be R
   CHF or EtOH. Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2162**]. No significant
   abnormalities seen on abdominal ultrasound.
   .
   # Elevated HCT:  Likely secondary to chronic hypoxia in the setting of
   OSA.
   - Trend
   .
   # Venous insuffiency:  B/l LE with significant erythema, followed by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.  Per review, had right leg non-healing
   ulcer in [**2171**] and LENI in [**2170**] which showed good flow. Upon admission,
   patient already had home VNA for bandage wraps and is in a PT exercise
   program.  Also status post Apligraf placement on his right leg on [**1-14**].
   Arterial flow studies, good flow until tibia.
   - Wound consult & Vascular following on floor; will continue their
   recommendations upon transfer
   - Some wounds with exudate, will use Mupirocin per Dermatology
   - Hold antibiotics given afebrile, no leukocytosis
   .
   # Patient Coping: Initial team concerned that patient may have some
   elemaent of undiagnosed depression, had obtained a SW consult.
   - Follow-up social work recs; plan for outpatient therapy
   - Continue newly started Citalopram
   .
   # FEN: 1.5L fluid restriction / replete PRN / NPO while AMS

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right-sided congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for altered mental status and somnolence. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and has shown improvement while on BiPAP, but his condition deteriorated when the BiPAP was briefly discontinued. The patient has a vancomycin allergy and was started on daptomycin due to a gram-positive cocci infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has a gram-positive cocci infection, and there is a concern for an occult infection. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been started.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and right-sided congestive heart failure. His condition may worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Venous Insufficiency: The patient has bilateral lower extremity erythema and a history of non-healing ulcers. This could indicate venous insufficiency, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema and ascites, which may be secondary to right heart failure or another underlying cause. Diuretics have been started to manage"

   LE swelling c/b BLE venous stasis breakdown s/p diuresis on the floor,
   now transferred to the ICU for AMS.
   .
   # AMS - Likely secondary to hypercardia / hypoxia due to obesity
   hypoventilation and sleep apnea.  Could be occult infection but no
   clear source and intial BP upon transfer was with patient not lying
   flat, now improved.  Also after significant diuresis.  LE with
   significant erythema, but review of records reveals this has been a
   stable issue for months to years, no leukocytosis, no fever.  Could
   also be pulmonary source (trialing and not tolerating CPAP), urinary or
   intra-abdominal.  Could be med effect but no new sedating meds in last
   several days.  Urine tox / serum tox negative.
   - GPC in blood, started Daptomycin given Vancomycin allergy
   - Trial BiPAP
   - ABG if worsens
   - Goal O2 88-92%
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Panculture: urine, blood & obtain CXR
   - Monitor BP, hemodynamics; no e/o sepsis at this time
   - Nonfocal, holding CT Head at this time
   - No clear e/o infection, will not LP unless fails to clear
   .
   # Hypoxia - Likely multifactorial including some pulmonary edema (as
   evidenced on CXR), pulmonary hypertension.  No e/o PNA as is afebrile
   and without leukocytosis.  CXR concerning for LLL process though poor
   study given body habitus. Some component of volume overload. Has
   effusions and vascular congestion. no e/o PE on CTA.
   - Trial BiPAP; will need O2 via NC when not on BiPAP, goal O2 88-92%
   - Diurese as above, but holding for ?hypotension
   - Hold antibiotics for PNA unless further e/o infection
   - Pulmonary recs from floor, should resume following after leaving ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia - With pH consistent with chronic process.  Maybe some
   component of slight acute worsening, but mostly chronic.  Likely [**2-8**]
   OSA, obesity; minimal evidence of COPD on PFTs.
   - BiPAP given with repeat ABG revealing minimal change in CO2
   .
   # Right heart failure - Secondary to cor pulmonae from COPD/OSA. No
   significant evidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Echo showed normal
   EF, not major LV dysfunction and showed significant pHTN and TR. No
   improvement with nitric oxide, thus not starting sildenafil or CCB.
   Patient s/p right and left heart cath. No evidence of ASD. L heart cath
   negative for CAD. For aggressive diuresis, switched from Lasix 120mg IV
   BID to lasix 10mg/hr ggt also given Diamox to compensatate for
   metabolic alkalosis.
   - Upon transfer, will hold Lasix, Spironolactone & Diamoxx given
   concern for hypotension
   - PM lytes
   - Daily weights & fluid restriction
   - Low salt diet once more alert and able to safely take PO
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:  Patient was seen by pulmonary and
   vasculitis labs sent. During R heart cath, severe pHTN and no
   improvement with nitric oxide. Sleep study not tolerated because
   patient could not tolerate CPAP mask. PFTs are reflective of
   restrictive physiology from obesity. Sleep study data was analyzed and
   patient was given Adapt SV machine instead of CPAP since AHI 63 and
   desat to 58%. Settings of PEEP 10 max pressure support 15 + 2L O2,
   patient will take this machine home with him. All vasculitis labs
   negative. Nebs not needed since not bronchospastic picture and
   restrictive not obsructive physiology.
   - Holding diuresis
   - Pt should lie with head elevation due large abdomen
   - BiPAP trial now and QHS
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently not anticoagluated [**2-8**] massive GIB
   while on coumadin and Ciprofloxacin.  Rate controlled with metoprolol.
   No ASA due to h/o GIB.  In OMR, warfarin was briefly restarted but upon
   transfer is not on medication list.
   - clarify current anticoagulation with primary team
   - hold Metoprolol given bradycardia upon transfer, likely needs lower
   dose and other [**Doctor Last Name **] for BP control should it be needed
   .
   # Anasarca:  Partially resolving, intially, grossly volume overloaded
   on exam, with ascites, BLE edema, and soft tissue edema in back and on
   abdomen. Also with bilateral crackles and likely effusions.  Initial
   etiologies considered included right heart failure, possibly secondary
   to left heart failure vs pulmonary HTN, OSA, or RV infarct. Not from
   liver synthetic dysfunction since albumin normal and not nephrotic
   syndrome since negative urinary protein.
   - Diursing since admission, hold for hypotension, but will restart as
   able
   .
   # Prurigo nodularis: Seen by Dermatology consult inpatient.
   - Per their recommendations, will continue atarax QHS, clobetasol 0.05%
   ointment [**Hospital1 **], capsaicin cream TID x 4 weeks, d/c neosporin, mupirocin
   Cream 2% 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] to open lesions / excoriations
   - f/u [**Hospital 8553**] clinic in 3 months
   .
   # Cardiac liver disease: Per intial team evaluation, patient has
   distended abdomen, minimal ascities, slightly elevated INR at 1.6,
   platlets normal, normal albumin so hepatic function is intact and there
   is not significant splenic platlet sequesteration. Etiology could be R
   CHF or EtOH. Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2162**]. No significant
   abnormalities seen on abdominal ultrasound.
   .
   # Elevated HCT:  Likely secondary to chronic hypoxia in the setting of
   OSA.
   - Trend
   .
   # Venous insuffiency:  B/l LE with significant erythema, followed by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.  Per review, had right leg non-healing
   ulcer in [**2171**] and LENI in [**2170**] which showed good flow. Upon admission,
   patient already had home VNA for bandage wraps and is in a PT exercise
   program.  Also status post Apligraf placement on his right leg on [**1-14**].
   Arterial flow studies, good flow until tibia.
   - Wound consult & Vascular following on floor; will continue their
   recommendations upon transfer
   - Some wounds with exudate, will use Mupirocin per Dermatology
   - Hold antibiotics given afebrile, no leukocytosis
   .
   # Patient Coping: Initial team concerned that patient may have some
   elemaent of undiagnosed depression, had obtained a SW consult.
   - Follow-up social work recs; plan for outpatient therapy

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF), and obesity. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), pulmonary edema, and impaired skin integrity. The patient also has a history of prurigo nodularis, anasarca, and venous insufficiency in both lower extremities.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered Mental Status (not delirium):
   - Likely secondary to hypercapnia/hypoxia due to obesity hypoventilation and sleep apnea.
   - Could be occult infection but no clear source and initial blood pressure upon transfer was with the patient not lying flat, now improved.
   - AMS could also be pulmonary, urinary, or intra-abdominal.
   - Trial BiPAP, ABG if worsens, goal O2 88-92%, avoid sedating medications.
   - Panculture: urine, blood & obtain chest X-ray.
   - Monitor BP, hemodynamics; no evidence of sepsis at this time.
   - No clear evidence of infection, will not lumbar puncture unless fails to clear.

2. Hypoxia:
   - Likely multifactorial including some pulmonary edema (as evidenced on chest X-ray), pulmonary hypertension.
   - No evidence of pneumonia as is afebrile and without leukoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prurigo nodularis. He presented with dyspnea, increased lower extremity (LE) swelling, and a non-healing ulcer on his right leg. Upon admission, he was started on BiPAP and antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection, but the source of infection remains unclear. The patient also has pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and anasarca, which is partially resolving. His cardiac function is intact with no significant liver dysfunction or nephrotic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status) - likely secondary to hypercarbia/hypoxia due to obesity hypoventilation and sleep apnea.
2. Hypoxia - likely multifactorial including some pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and volume overload.
3. Hypercarbia - with pH consistent with chronic process, possibly exacerbated by OSA and obesity.
4. Right Heart Failure - secondary to cor pulmonale from COPD/OSA. No significant evidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea - severe PHTN and no improvement with nitric oxide.
6. Atrial Fibrillation - rate-controlled with metoprolol, but anticoagulation status needs clarification.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right-sided congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prurigo nodularis. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (not delirium) and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, increased lower extremity swelling, and breakdown of venous stasis ulcers following diuresis on the floor. He is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 60% and has been responding well. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 69 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 476. The patient has a history of GIB while on coumadin and Ciprofloxacin. He is currently on metoprolol for rate control of atrial fibrillation but is experiencing bradycardia upon transfer. The patient has anasarca with resolving edema and effusions. He has a history of RHF possibly secondary to LHF or pulmonary HTN, OSA, or RV infarct. He is being diuresed since admission and held for hypotension. His labs show elevated Hct likely secondary to chronic hypoxia. The patient also has venous insufficiency with significant erythema and non-healing"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and was admitted with respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.34, which is slightly below the normal range, suggesting respiratory acidosis. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is elevated at 67 mmHg, indicating hypoventilation. The oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95%, which is within the normal range. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and temperature (T) of 36.3Â°C. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 698 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 23 cmH2O, and the plateau pressure (Pplat) is not mentioned. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and the presence of skin lesions. The patient is overweight and obese, with warm skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 21100 cells/mm3, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) at 10.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 110 mg/dL, decreased sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, decreased potassium (K+) at 3.6 mEq/L, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.0 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose (Glucose) at 143 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function, are within normal limits. 

Radiology images indicate an enlarged cardiac silhouette, engorged and indistinct pulmonary vasculature, and small pleural effusions. 

The patient's medical conditions include bacteremia, altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension (PULM HTN, PHTN), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (Protonix), and daptomycin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and further deterioration of skin integrity."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with dyspnea, increased lower extremity (LE) swelling, and a non-healing wound on his right leg. The patient is currently in the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and is allergic to vancomycin. The patient has multiple medical complications including anasarca (generalized swelling), prurigo nodularis, cardiac liver disease, and venous insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory difficulties, which have led to his current need for non-invasive ventilation and BiPAP support. There is a concern for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension contributing to his respiratory issues.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy is continued until the source of infection is identified and treated.
3. Anasarca: The patient has generalized swelling, known as anasarca, which may be secondary to right heart failure or other underlying conditions. Fluid restriction and diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage this condition"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right-sided congestive heart failure, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented with dyspnea and increased lower extremity swelling, leading to the initiation of diuretic therapy. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was noted to have altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's medical history is significant for obesity, hypoventilation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to hypoxia. The patient has also been diagnosed with anasarca, prurigo nodularis, and cardiac liver disease. He is currently being treated with various medications, including daptomycin, heparin, pantoprazole, and citalopram.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. His current medications include daptomycin, heparin, pantoprazole, and citalopram.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   57 yo M with afib, right sided CHF presenting with dyspnea, increased
   LE swelling c/b BLE venous stasis breakdown s/p diuresis on the floor,
   now transferred to the ICU for AMS, now with GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # AMS - Likely secondary to hypercarbia / hypoxia due to obesity
   hypoventilation and sleep apnea.  Does have GPC bacteremia but has been
   afebrile.  Also had significant diuresis.  LE with significant
   erythema, but review of records reveals this has been a stable issue
   for months to years, no leukocytosis, no fever.  Could also be
   pulmonary source (trialing and not tolerating CPAP), urinary or
   intra-abdominal.  Could be med effect but no new sedating meds in last
   several days.  Urine tox / serum tox negative.
   - mental status at baseline, gradually tolerating BIPAP
   - GPC in blood, started Daptomycin given Vancomycin allergy, f/u
   speciation and sensitivity
   - follow [**Doctor Last Name 8565**] with mental status prn
   - Goal O2 88-92%
   - Avoid sedating medications
   - Monitor BP, hemodynamics; no e/o sepsis at this time
   - f/u sleep recs
   .
   # GPC bacteremia- unclear source, sources include lower ext ulcers, IE
   - continue daptomycin until sensitivity returns
   - TTE today
   - xrays of R foot to asses for infection
   .
   # Hypoxia - Likely multifactorial including some pulmonary edema (as
   evidenced on CXR), pulmonary hypertension.  No e/o PNA as is afebrile
   and without leukocytosis.  CXR concerning for LLL process though poor
   study given body habitus. Some component of volume overload. Has
   effusions and vascular congestion. no e/o PE on CTA.
   - BiPAP; will need O2 via NC when not on BiPAP, goal O2 88-92%
   - Diurese with oral lasix
   - Pulmonary recs from floor, should resume following if leaves ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia - With pH consistent with chronic process.  Maybe some
   component of slight acute worsening, but mostly chronic.  Likely [**2-8**]
   OSA, obesity; minimal evidence of COPD on PFTs.
   - BiPAP given with repeat ABG revealing minimal change in CO2
   - Follow MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8565**], BiPAP as needed
   .
   # Right heart failure - Secondary to cor pulmonae from COPD/OSA. No
   significant evidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Echo showed normal
   EF, not major LV dysfunction and showed significant pHTN and TR. No
   improvement with nitric oxide, thus not starting sildenafil or CCB.
   Patient s/p right and left heart cath. No evidence of ASD. L heart cath
   negative for CAD. For aggressive diuresis, switched from Lasix 120mg IV
   BID to lasix 10mg/hr ggt also given Diamox to compensatate for
   metabolic alkalosis.
   - lasix 120mg PO BID, 500cc negative, 600cc negative since MN, continue
   current doses
   - PM lytes
   - Daily weights & fluid restriction
   - Low salt diet once more alert and able to safely take PO
   - Restart BB
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:  Patient was seen by pulmonary and
   vasculitis labs sent. During R heart cath, severe pHTN and no
   improvement with nitric oxide. Sleep study not tolerated because
   patient could not tolerate CPAP mask. PFTs are reflective of
   restrictive physiology from obesity. Sleep study data was analyzed and
   patient was given Adapt SV machine instead of CPAP since AHI 63 and
   desat to 58%. Settings of PEEP 10 max pressure support 15 + 2L O2,
   patient will take this machine home with him. All vasculitis labs
   negative. Nebs not needed since not bronchospastic picture and
   restrictive not obsructive physiology.
   - Pt should lie with head elevation due large abdomen
   - BiPAP trial now and QHS
   - sleep consult
   - consider ambien
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently not anticoagluated [**2-8**] massive GIB
   while on coumadin and Ciprofloxacin.  Rate controlled with metoprolol.
   No ASA due to h/o GIB.  In OMR, warfarin was briefly restarted but upon
   transfer is not on medication list.
   - clarify current anticoagulation with primary team: NO plans for
   anticoagulation
   - will restart BB
   .
   # Anasarca:  Partially resolving, intially, grossly volume overloaded
   on exam, with ascites, BLE edema, and soft tissue edema in back and on
   abdomen. Also with bilateral crackles and likely effusions.  Initial
   etiologies considered included right heart failure, possibly secondary
   to left heart failure vs pulmonary HTN, OSA, or RV infarct. Not from
   liver synthetic dysfunction since albumin normal and not nephrotic
   syndrome since negative urinary protein.
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Prurigo nodularis: Seen by Dermatology consult inpatient.
   - Per their recommendations, will continue atarax QHS, clobetasol 0.05%
   ointment [**Hospital1 **], capsaicin cream TID x 4 weeks, d/c neosporin, mupirocin
   Cream 2% 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] to open lesions / excoriations
   - f/u [**Hospital 8553**] clinic in 3 months
   .
   # Cardiac liver disease: Per intial team evaluation, patient has
   distended abdomen, minimal ascities, slightly elevated INR at 1.6,
   platlets normal, normal albumin so hepatic function is intact and there
   is not significant splenic platlet sequesteration. Etiology could be R
   CHF or EtOH. Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2162**]. No significant
   abnormalities seen on abdominal ultrasound.
   .
   # Elevated HCT:  Likely secondary to chronic hypoxia in the setting of
   OSA.
   - Trend
   .
   # Venous insuffiency:  B/l LE with significant erythema, followed by
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.  Per review, had right leg non-healing
   ulcer in [**2171**] and LENI in [**2170**] which showed good flow. Upon admission,
   patient already had home VNA for bandage wraps and is in a PT exercise
   program.  Also status post Apligraf placement on his right leg on [**1-14**].
   Arterial flow studies, good flow until tibia.
   - Wound consult & Vascular following on floor; will continue their
   recommendations upon transfer
   - Some wounds with exudate, will use Mupirocin per Dermatology
   - [**Month (only) 60**] be source of GPCs in blood cx, on Dapto, awaiting speciation
   .
   # Patient Coping: Initial team concerned that patient may have some
   element of undiagnosed depression, had obtained a SW consult.
   - Follow-up social work recs; plan for outpatient therapy
   - Continue newly started Citalopram

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right-sided congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status, bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's medical history includes previous episodes of venous stasis, non-healing ulcers, and a recent episode of gastrointestinal bleeding while on warfarin and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension may lead to acute respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of Gram-positive cocci bacteremia could progress to sepsis if appropriate antibiotics are not administered and the source of infection is not identified and treated.
3. Right Heart Failure: The patient's history of right-sided congestive heart failure may worsen due to pulmonary hypertension and volume overload, leading to further cardiac complications.
4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient's OSA could worsen during the night due to factors such as obesity, hypoventilation, and the use of sedating medications, potentially leading to recurrent episodes of hypoxia and hypercarbia.
5. Venous Insufficiency: The patient's chronic venous insufficiency may progress to more severe complications such as deep vein thrombosis or venous ulcers if proper wound"

   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:  Patient was seen by pulmonary and
   vasculitis labs sent. During R heart cath, severe pHTN and no
   improvement with nitric oxide. Sleep study not tolerated because
   patient could not tolerate CPAP [**Month/Day (2) **]. PFTs are reflective of
   restrictive physiology from obesity.  He is currently on ASV machine by
   home care but still not tolerating with persistent hypoxia.  Awaiting
   home care to titrate settings.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and diagnosed with bacteremia, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via a nasal cannula and has a central line and arterial line in place. He is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. His temperature is within normal range. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and altered mental status indicate a potential risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is low despite being on mechanical ventilation. This suggests inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, increasing the risk of further respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure exacerbation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic renal insufficiency, and prurigo nodularis. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status likely due to multifactorial causes including pulmonary edema, obstructive sleep apnea, and bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci, which may lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient's AMS is likely due to multiple factors including pulmonary edema, OSA, and GPC bacteremia. It is important to address these underlying causes to improve the patient's mental status.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can be prone to infections or other complications. Proper wound care and monitoring are essential.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which can worsen if not managed properly. Diuresis and oxygen therapy may be necessary to alleviate symptoms.
5. Pulmonary Hypertension (Pulm HTN, PHTN): The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart failure if not managed appropriately. Treatment options may include diuretics, oxygen therapy,"

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure exacerbation, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic renal leg ulcer. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity due to chronic RLE ulcer increases the risk of infection and wound complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and if not managed properly, it can progress to respiratory arrest.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart failure if not managed effectively.
5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea, and inadequate management can result in recurrent hypoxia and respiratory complications.
6. Hypercarbia: The patient has chronic hypercarbia, which can worsen respiratory failure and cause metabolic acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic renal insufficiency, and right lower extremity ulcer. He was admitted with a CHF exacerbation and subsequently transferred to the ICU for altered mental status likely due to multifactorial causes including pulmonary edema, obstructive sleep apnea, and gram-positive bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pulmonary edema and the presence of fever and cough may indicate an increased risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization and underlying risk factors, there is a possibility of developing DVT.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged bed rest and obesity increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure, acute on chronic, along with the presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale suggests a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of multiple comorbidities increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Wound Infection: The patient's chronic right lower extremity ulcer increases the risk of developing a wound infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation (AF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic renal leg ulcer (RLE). The patient was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), likely multifactorial, including pulmonary edema, OSA, and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The most likely source of bacteremia is the RLE ulcer.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention:
1. MSSA Bacteremia/RLE ULCER - The patient has a chronic RLE ulcer, which is suspected to be the source of MSSA bacteremia. Surveillance blood cultures are being taken, and the patient is receiving a two-week course of nafcillin due to negative cultures.
2. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - The patient has severe OSA, for which he uses an adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) machine provided by home care. The machine settings need to be adjusted to optimize the patient's oxygenation.
3. Hypoxia - The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, including pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. The patient is on BiPAP and will require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula when not on BiPAP. Diuresis with oral lasix is also being initiated to manage fluid balance.
