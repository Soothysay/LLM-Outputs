","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, chronic. The patient has been in the ICU since 08/06/2168 and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 154/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including Diltiazem and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels. The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to not being assessed in several areas. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and worsening of impaired skin integrity. These complications need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration in the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes and a prolonged stay at another hospital. He was admitted to the ICU with fevers of unclear origin, acute renal failure, progressive respiratory failure leading to tracheostomy placement, and delirium. The patient requires invasive ventilation, and his vital signs are stable. He has a high fever, and his blood cultures were taken. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, heart medications, and insulin. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, high potassium levels, and low albumin levels. The chest X-ray indicates low lung volumes, large cardiac silhouette, inability to visualize the left hemidiaphragm, and possible left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is suspected to have multifactorial respiratory failure due to underlying obesity and volume overload. There is also a concern for delirium, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's mental status improves when his wife is present, and he has a history of hypernatremia. Renal failure has improved without intervention aside from one episode of dialysis. The patient's nutrition is being addressed, and he has a gastrointestinal tube in place. He is anticoagulated with heparin but has a subtherapeutic INR. The patient is on full code status and will be kept in the ICU for further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes who was transferred from another hospital due to prolonged stay and symptoms including fevers of unclear origin, acute renal failure, progressive respiratory failure leading to tracheostomy placement, and delirium. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since August 6th. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He has been receiving various medications such as piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), diltiazem, heparin for DVT, fentanyl patch, insulin sliding scale, and others.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure ranging from 154/78 mmHg to 160/79 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient has received a total of 2,407 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 1,055 mL of urine. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 657 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen set at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2 of 182 mmHg, and oxygen consumption of 13.2 L/min.

Physical examination reveals eomian eye movement, pupils reactive and equal, diffuse rhonchi and expiratory squeaks in the lungs, an obese abdomen with a non-tender and protected nasogastric tube in place, trace edema, and warm extremities. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 426 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 198 mg/dL, and other abnormal laboratory values including elevated liver enzymes, lactate level, and lactic acid level. Chest X-ray findings suggest low lung volumes, large cardiac silhouette, inability to visualize the left hemidiaphragm, and possible left-sided pleural effusion.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have multifactorial respiratory failure, possibly due to underlying obesity, volume overload, and tracheostomy malacia. The patient is currently tolerating 5-17 breaths per minute without pronounced leak from the tracheostomy. A spontaneous breathing trial was unsuccessful due to tachycardia and tachypnea. The patient's tracheostomy cuff pressure is very high, indicating the need for tracheostomy change. Consultation with interventional pul"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admit with multiple medical complications. The patient has a right internal jugular thrombus, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombus in the right internal jugular vein: This indicates a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
2. Hypernatremia: High sodium levels in the blood can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, seizures, and potentially cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Fever of unknown origin: An ongoing fever without a known cause may indicate an infection or inflammatory process within the body.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Irregular heart rhythm that increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
5. Back pain: May be indicative of musculoskeletal issues, spinal cord compression, or other underlying conditions.
6. Impaired skin integrity: Can lead to pressure ulcers, infections, and potential complications like sepsis.
7. Altered mental status: Can be a result of various factors such as medication side effects, infection, organ dysfunction, or trauma.
8. Chronic respiratory failure: Prolonged inability to adequately oxygenate and remove carbon dioxide from the blood, leading to respiratory acid"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of obesity, volume overload, malacia, and respiratory failure. The patient's tracheostomy tube was changed yesterday due to a leak, and they required additional pressure support overnight. The patient is autodiuresing and no longer in renal failure. They are also being treated for delirium, fevers of unclear origin, and hypernatremia. The patient's condition is multifactorial, and further investigations are needed to determine the underlying causes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further due to their underlying obesity, volume overload, and malacia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilation support will be necessary to prevent complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient has suspected infections, including a urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial to prevent the progression of infection and associated complications.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing prolonged delirium, which can increase the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and falls. Close monitoring of mental status and avoidance of sedating medications will be important in managing this condition.

4. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, changes in antibiotics, and the use of anticoagulants.
- The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 133/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 at 50%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, no murmur, expiratory wheezes, occasional rhonchi, and trace edema.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose, and liver enzymes, as well as low potassium levels.
- The patient's renal function has improved, but there are concerns about malacia, delirium, fevers of unclear origin, and hypernatremia.
- The patient is planned to be weaned off mechanical ventilation today.
- Assessment and plan include addressing respiratory failure, delirium, and fevers, obtaining sputum and blood cultures, reviewing outside records, and consulting with a hematologist/oncologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and is experiencing multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is exhibiting daily fevers and has a prolonged hospital course, which may be contributing to his delirium. Further evaluation of the patient's medical history and imaging records is needed. Medications such as haloperidol can be used to manage agitation, and it is important to avoid sedating medications. An infectious workup should also be conducted.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had extensive fever workup including a PET scan, but no definitive cause has been identified. Previous antibiotic courses have been administered for possible pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Elevated levels of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) suggest the possibility of malignancy. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures should be obtained, and an infectious disease consultation may be necessary.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, with tracheobronchomalacia noted on CT scan. No current evidence of tracheostomy leak is observed. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be conducted, and a chest X-ray should be performed. Consideration should be given to an interventional pulmonology evaluation for st"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently intubated and has a tracheostomy tube in place. He is also receiving nutrition through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube).

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Delirium: The patient has ongoing daily fevers, which may be concerning for infection. The prolonged hospital course could also be a contributing factor to the delirium. The plan is to review the patient's occupational health (OSH) records regarding prior workup, avoid sedating medications, administer haloperidol as needed for agitation, and continue with an infectious workup.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): Despite extensive fever workup, including a PET scan, the cause of the fever remains unknown. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection with various antibiotic courses. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are concerning for malignancy. The plan is to obtain OSH records, continue with zosyn for UTI, and consider an infectious disease (ID) consult pending obtaining OSH records.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure with no current evidence of tracheal leak. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is noted on the CT scan. The patient is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and has undergone tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, and tracheobronchomalacia. He also has anemia, sciatica, a right internal jugular vein thrombus, and renal failure. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various aspects, including infection, respiratory support, fluid balance, nutrition, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's ongoing daily fevers and prolonged hospital course may contribute to delirium. It is important to review past medical records and avoid sedating medications. An infectious workup should be continued, and underlying causes need to be addressed.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite extensive fever workup, including a PET scan, the cause of the patient's fever remains unidentified. Further investigation is warranted, including obtaining past medical records, conducting blood, urine, and sputum cultures, and considering an infectious disease consultation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be related to tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Close monitoring and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning are recommended. A chest X-ray should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure.
   .
   Respiratory failure- patient had trach changed and was able to tolerate
   trach mask all day yesterday, although patient seems to feel
   subjectively uncomfortable.
   -continue trach mask as tolerated
   -chest PT/suctioning.
   -consider IP eval for ?tracheomalacia.
   -trial of PMV did not work well for patient, had very high tracheal
   pressures in the 30 mmH2O; possibly secondary to some TBM, continue to
   monitor on trach mask today
   .
    Delerium.  Patient has ongoing daily fevers concerning for infection
   as well as prolonged hospital course as etiology of delerium.  Will
   need to review OSH records regarding prior workup.
   - review OSH head imaging; reportedly normal
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   -mental status seems appropriate, workup as below, continue to monitor
   and avoid sedation meds; may have been secondary to hypoxia or
   secondary to infection or ICU delerium
     Fever. U.o- Patient has had reportedly extensive fever workup
   including PET scan (radiology now uploaded into PACs).  Patient has
   been treated for PNA, UTI with various antibiotic courses.  Elevated
   LDH concerning for malignancy.  Patient never underwent bone marrow
   biopsy.
   - obtain OSH records
   - continue ceftriaxone for positive UA
   - blood, urine, sputum, c. diff pending from here
   -consider hemoonc c/s for BM bx in future, not urgent, could be done as
   outpatient
   .
   MAT: rates in the 100s-130s, not well controlled on max dilt.  Blood
   pressure always stable
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - will start metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   ARF.  Patient with improving renal failure.  Initial insult thought to
   be NSAID use.  Patient is s/p one day of HD 2 months ago.
   - avoid nephrotixins
   - creatinine normalized, continue to monitor
   .
   DM-glargine and HISS, titrating upward
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
     Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica.
   - initated fentanyl patch

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomized and requires respiratory support. There is a possibility of ongoing respiratory failure due to tracheomalacia or other underlying lung conditions.

2. Delirium: The patient has ongoing daily fevers, which could be concerning for infection or prolonged hospital course as an etiology of delirium. It is important to review OSH records regarding prior workup and consider avoiding sedation medications.

3. Fever: Despite extensive fever workup, including PET scan, the patient has been treated for pneumonia, urinary tract infection with various antibiotic courses. Elevated LDH is concerning for malignancy. It is necessary to obtain OSH records and continue ceftriaxone for positive urine analysis.

4. Uncontrolled heart rate: The patient's heart rate is in the 100s-130s, not well controlled on maximum diltiazem. Blood pressure remains stable. It is recommended to continue diltiazem and start metoprolol.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had renal failure, possibly due to NSAID use. One day of hemodialysis was performed 2 months ago. It is crucial to avoid nephrotoxins and continue monitoring creatinine levels.

6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient requires glargine and hissing insulin, titrating upward.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myocardial infarction), fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing ongoing fevers, which are concerning for infection. Despite antibiotic treatment, the fever persists. There are also signs of delirium, with altered mental status and agitation.

The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by a tracheal leak after changing to a size 8 tracheostomy tube. This may be contributing to his failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Other medical complications include renal failure, likely due to NSAID use, and anemia. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and sciatica.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

2. Tracheomalacia: Considering the tracheal leak and the need for high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tracheomalacia may be a concern.

3. Malignancy: Elevated LDH levels are concerning for malignancy, and further evaluation is needed, including a bone marrow biopsy.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Despite negative urine culture results, the patient continues to receive antibiotics for a suspected UTI. Further evaluation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of delirium and the question of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient developed acute renal failure and ARDS/acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 171/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and being weaned off the ventilator.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within the normal range. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and the chest X-ray reveals limited inspiration and an invisible left hemidiaphragm.

The patient's medical complications include hypernatremia (high sodium levels), fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, and a right internal jugular thrombus.

The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of delirium and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA). He was previously in a rehabilitation center where he had difficulty weaning from assisted ventilation and had ongoing tracheal leaks.

The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation/tracheostomy cuff trial in the ICU and does not require immediate intervention for TBM. However, a speech and swallow evaluation is planned for possible tracheostomy tube removal.

The patient's mental status appears to be improving, as he is now able to communicate. He also has a long-standing low-grade fever of unknown origin, and follow-up serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) is recommended.

The patient has been prescribed a 7-day course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has MRSA sputum cultures from the previous hospital, which may be contaminants without evidence of infection.

The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is being managed with a high dose of calcium channel blocker, but he remains tachycardic. A low dose beta blocker will be added for further management.

The patient's diabetes mellitus ("

   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent secondary to ?tracheomalacia..
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was doing well after trach size increased but required resting
   on PSV overnight.  Additionally, had high tracheal pressure with PMV
   use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity hypoventilation.
   - IP consult for ?stent placement
   -continue trach mask as tolerated
   -chest PT/suctioning.
   - attempt wean to trach collar mask
   .
   Delerium.  Patient has ongoing daily fevers concerning for infection,
   though this has been going on for so long that infectious etiologies
   less likely.  Completing ceftriaxone for UTI today.  Mental status
   overall improving, but not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**] 2
   months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course, including AMS (acute myocardial infarction), fevers, respiratory failure, delirium, and potential infections. The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/81 to 185/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's medical history includes treatment for PAN (polyarteritis nodosa), endocarditis, and potential malignancy. 

The patient's plan includes continuing tracheostomy mask as tolerated, suctioning, and monitoring for tracheomalacia. Delirium workup is pending, and the patient will be reviewed for ongoing fevers. Antibiotic therapy will continue for positive urine analysis results. Metoprolol will be started to control high blood pressure. 

Renal function is improving, and the patient will avoid nephrotoxic agents. Anemia studies are needed, and the patient is being titrated on glargine and hissing. Sciatica treatment includes a fentanyl patch. Thrombus management involves obtaining OSH records,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS, fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 100.7°F (38.2°C), blood pressure ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 185/84 mmHg, heart rate between 96-121 bpm, respiratory rate of 19-41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has been diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and is being considered for a tracheal stent placement. He also has delirium, fever of unknown origin, anemia, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, sciatica, and a history of right internal jugular vein thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): The patient has been diagnosed with TBM, which can lead to airway collapse during positive pressure ventilation. This increases the risk of complications such as tracheal stenosis, recurrent infections, and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Delirium: The patient's ongoing daily fevers and prolonged hospital course may contribute to delirium. It"

   at night.  In fact, patient had PMV at [**Hospital1 25**].  A bronch was
   performed at [**Hospital1 25**] by a [**Hospital1 12**] pulmonologist who recommended tracheal
   stent for TBM
   - Medical record release forms faxed to [**Hospital1 959**] and [**Hospital1 25**].  If they
   don't arrive by morning, these forms should be re-faxed.  They were put
   in front of chart.
   - His [**Hospital1 959**] records came in the form of a 1.5 page, one paragraph,
   chronoligical summary of his 1 month hospital stay.  In terms of FUO
   workup, he was treated for PAN several dtimes.  He had a TEE and TTE
   tor/o endocarditis.  He tested negative for flu, q- fever, erlichia.
   An IR guided LP was negative for bacterial or viral meningitis..
   Treatment with doxy failed to improve fevers.  PET scan was performed
   to ""definitevly rulo out any infectious source of fever"".
   - In terms of his delerium, EEG did not show seizure activity and Head
   CT was negative.  Neuro felt he had ICU delerium and toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   - With regards to respiratory status, he was unable to be weaned of PSV
   at [**Hospital1 959**].  He failed Trach collar mask.  He was unable to have PS less
   than 8.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization due to ARDS/acute respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing ongoing low-grade fevers for months. The patient's mental status has been waxing and waning, and he is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight but not persistent mechanical ventilation (PMV) due to high tracheostomy pressures. The patient has a tracheostomy in place, and there is a concern for possible tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury resulting in respiratory failure. This condition requires specialized care in the ICU.
2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers for an extended period, which needs further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. Potential causes include infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, indicating acute mental status changes. It is important to evaluate and monitor the patient for any neurological abnormalities.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): The patient's inability to tolerate PMV may be related to TBM, a condition characterized by weakness and collapse of the trachea and bronch"

   1.  Acute respiratory failure s/p PNA/ARDS: per rehab reports, was
   tolerating PMV and trach collar by day, PSV overnight
   -better trach collar tolerance with up-sized trach
   -wil ask IP to comment on possible intervention
   -failed PMV trial due to high trach pressures- possibly related to TBM?
   cont to re-assess, esp in light of possible IP intervention
   2.  Acute mental status- continues to wax and wane. cont to eval for
   fevers as below
   3.  Fevers: ongoing low grade fevers for months-
   -f/u SPEP and UPEP
   -Complete a 7 day course of abx for UTI w/ CTX
   -MRSA sputum cultures from OSH- potentially colonizer; consider
   treating if clinical picture warrants
   -will pursue bone marrow biopsy given OSH PET report and neg FUO workup

   housestaff team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4052**]
s note above, and would add: 58 yo male with
   prolonged hospitalization at OSH in [**5-21**] with transient ARF,
   respiratory failure s/p trach/PEG, with ongoing fevers, waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 226**] MS, slow ventilator wean. Issues:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: On TC during the day, PSV overnight which
   we
ve learned is unchanged from course at [**Hospital1 25**]. Did not tolerate
   PMV yesterday. PMV intolerance at [**Hospital1 25**] + outside bronch results led
   to concern for TBM. Will consult IP.
   2. Fevers: Long w/u at OSH includes ID consult, multiple cultures, PET
   scan, TTE/TEE. SPEP and UPEP. Heme consult re:? BMBx
   3. MAT: reasonable rate control on beta- and calcium channel blocker.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a prolonged hospitalization for ARDS/acute respiratory failure, waxing and waning mental status, fevers, and multiple comorbidities. The patient's current status includes acute respiratory failure, acute mental status changes, ongoing low-grade fevers for months, and other chronic conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory issues due to ARDS. There is a concern for tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) as the patient did not tolerate pressure-controlled mandatory ventilation (PMV) and had high tracheal pressures. This may require further evaluation and intervention by interventional pulmonology (IP).

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers for an extended period, despite extensive workup including imaging, cultures, and a PET scan. Further evaluation is needed, including pending SPEP and UPEP results. A seven-day course of antibiotics (CTX) has been prescribed for a urinary tract infection (UTI). MRSA sputum cultures from outside sources are negative, but consideration should be given to treating if the clinical picture warrants it. A bone marrow biopsy has been planned due to the PET report and negative fever workup otherwise.

3. MAT (likely referring to myocardial attack or myocarditis): The patient is on a high dose of calcium channel blocker and beta-blocker for rate control,"

He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to tracheomalacia. He is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a central line. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have daily fevers. His mental status has been fluctuating, and he is currently on haloperidol for agitation. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and he completed a course of ceftriaxone for a suspected urinary tract infection. An extensive workup for FUO has been done, including a lumbar puncture, tests for ehrlichia and Q fever, and therapy with doxycycline. A PET scan revealed increased uptake in the bone marrow and spleen. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, anemia, sciatica, and a right iliac vein thrombus. He is on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and insulin. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source
   - consider Lumbar/Sacral imaging if diagnostic workup is unrevealing
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP will bronch today to evaluate for trachemalacia.
   NO evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - IP to bronch today for ?stent placement
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (altered mental status), fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized. He was transferred to the ICU for inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent FUO.

The patient has had extensive FUO workup at another hospital, including LP (lumbar puncture), ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy, and a positive PET scan showing increased uptake in the marrow and spleen. His Glucan level is positive, indicating a fungal infection. He has been treated with 7 days of Zosyn for a urinary tract infection (UTI), but repeat urine analysis only shows yeast. Heme/onc is willing to pursue a bone marrow biopsy if no clear source of fevers is found.

The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during the day, but he still requires pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night. An IP (intensivist) will perform a bronchoscopic evaluation today to evaluate for tracheomalacia. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection at present, and the possibility of tracheostomy stent placement is being considered.

The patient also has delirium, which is suspected to be secondary to AMS due to fevers and prolonged hospital stay"

   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source
   - consider Lumbar/Sacral imaging if diagnostic workup is unrevealing
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP will bronch today to evaluate for trachemalacia.
   NO evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - IP to bronch today for ?stent placement
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition that requires immediate medical attention. The patient's inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent respiratory failure indicate a serious underlying issue.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had extensive workup for FUO, including tests such as LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, and PET scan. The presence of increased uptake in the marrow and spleen suggests a possible hematologic or oncologic cause. The patient's positive Glucan result also suggests a fungal infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the fever.

3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium, which is characterized by confusion, agitation, and disorientation. This may be secondary to the prolonged hospital stay, fevers, and underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring of mental status is necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with low hemoglobin levels. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of anemia. The elevated ferritin level may indicate a reactive process or decub ulcers.

5. Sciatica: The patient complains of severe sciatica, which is well controlled with fentanyl. However, the nature and source of pain should be clarified, and appropriate pain management should be implemented.

6. Thrombus: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization, acute respiratory failure, and other medical conditions. The patient's current health status is as follows:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a high fever despite extensive investigations ruling out infectious sources. The presence of beta-glucan suggests a possible fungal infection. Further tests, including mucolytic blood cultures and galactomannan, are pending. A CT scan of the torso is also recommended.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient requires tracheostomy tube support and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 set at 50%. The RSBI value is 52, indicating the need for continued respiratory support. An attempt to wean off the ventilator will be made today.

3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient appears to be interactive and able to follow commands, so no immediate acute intervention is required.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has resolved, but it is important to monitor his hematocrit levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

- Respiratory complications due to acute respiratory failure and tracheobronchomalacia.
- Infections, including fungal infections indicated by the positive beta-glucan result.
- Renal complications if the patient's renal function deteriorates again.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been in the hospital for two months, experiencing acute respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current condition includes prolonged oxygen saturation (OSH), negative infectious source workup, positive beta-glucan indicating a potential fungal infection, ongoing fevers, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, resolved acute renal failure, and hypernatremia (high sodium).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite extensive workup. This could indicate an ongoing infection or other underlying medical condition.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation support. There is a question of Tuberculosis (TBM) involvement in the respiratory failure, which needs further evaluation.

3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient exhibits altered mental status, but appears interactive and able to follow commands. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely for any deterioration.

4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, which may contribute to the current acute episode.

5. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tr"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source
   - consider Lumbar/Sacral imaging if diagnostic workup is unrevealing
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP will bronch today to evaluate for trachemalacia.
   NO evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - IP to bronch today for ?stent placement
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Getting heparin to coumadin

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing decreasing leukocytosis and fever, and the ID recommends continuing with pseudomonas treatment.
- The patient is currently on ceftaz, tobra, and flagyl. Ceftaz is administered every 36 hours, tobra every 48 hours, and flagyl continuously.
- Linezolid has been stopped as there is no evidence of GPC, and cipro has also been stopped due to pseudomonas cipro resistance.
- Neuro has recommended a loading dose of dilantin and then changed the daily dosing to 100 mg at 8am, 100 mg at 4pm, and 200 mg at 12am. Dilantin levels will be checked tomorrow.
- No new recommendations from endo, but calcium will continue to be monitored.
- The patient did not tolerate a tracheal mask in the afternoon and was very tachypneic immediately after stopping pressure support.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Ceftriaxone at 01:00 PM.
- Infusions: Heparin sodium at 2,550 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications: Midazolam (Versed) at [**2168-8-10**] 03:45 PM and Fentanyl at [**2168-8-"

   than right, and patchy ground-glass opacities of the mid-to-lower
   lungs, significantly improved from [**2168-6-28**], most likely resolving
   pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing decreasing leukocytosis and fever curve, which indicates an improvement in their infection.
- The ID team recommends continuing with the current treatment plan for pseudomonas infection, despite the expected resistance to ceftaz.
- The patient is already on ceftaz, tobra (tobramycin), and flagyl (metronidazole) for the infection.
- Linezolid has been stopped as there is no evidence of GPC (gram-positive cocci), and cipro has been stopped due to pseudomonas cipro resistance.
- The neurologist has recommended a loading dose of dilantin and then changed the daily dosing to 100 mg at 8am, 100 mg at 4pm, and 200 mg at 12am. Dilantin levels will be checked tomorrow.
- There are no new recommendations from endocrinology, and calcium levels will continue to be monitored.
- The patient was unable to tolerate the tracheal mask in the afternoon due to tachypnea almost immediately after stopping pressure support.
- The patient has a history of back pain, which is unchanged from admission.
- Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device.
- The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of"

   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source
   - consider Lumbar/Sacral imaging if diagnostic workup is unrevealing
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP will bronch today to evaluate for trachemalacia.
   NO evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - IP to bronch today for ?stent placement
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.

    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (altered mental status), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He was transferred to the ICU for inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has had extensive workup for FUO, including LP (lumbar puncture), ehrlichia, q-fever, and trial of therapy with doxycycline. A PET scan showed increased uptake in the marrow and spleen. Glucan returned positive today at greater than assay level, indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn (ceftriaxone) for UTI (urinary tract infection). Repeat UA (urinalysis) shows only yeast. Heme/onc (hematology/oncology) is willing to pursue bone marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found. The patient has also been exposed to zosyn recently, but the level of positivity seems to be higher than what would be expected with zosyn exposure. Galactomanan is still pending. The patient's back exam revealed only tenderness at the sacrum. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, ceftazidime, tobramycin, and flagyl. He is also receiving nutritional support through tube"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent.
   - consider Lumbar/Sacral imaging if diagnostic workup is unrevealing
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia. NO
   evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch
   -will discuss back imaging to r/o infection.
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Getting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin to coumadin bridging

   resp failure with ?TBM, ongoing fevers
   1.  FUO: prolonged OSH w/u negative for infectious source. Of note is
   the +beta-glucan which raises concern for fungal infection
   -Mucolytic blood cultures and galactomannan pending
   -CT Torso without source of infxn
   -will get MRI LS spine to evaluate
   -Possible BMBx by Heme later this wk if fevers persist without clear
   cause
   -probable ID consult following imaging
   2.  Acute respiratory failure: related to prior pna, has underlying TBM
   and sleep-disordered breathing
   -TC by day
   -PSV overnight
   -IP to place bronchial stents once infectious issues resolved
   3.  AMS: appears reasonable; pt interactive and able to follow
   commands. No acute intervention
   -will get Portuguese interpreter to better evaluate

   yesterday by Interventional Pulmonary revealed severe diffuse TBM that
   is likely contributing to the pt
s acute respiratory failure and
   prolonged ventilator wean. The first step would be placement of a
   silicone Y stent; however there is no urgent need for its placement,
   esp. in the context of possible active infection which would pose a
   relative contraindication. CT Torso without obvious infectious source;
   pt getting MRI of the LS spine given ongoing complaints of back pain,
   galactomanan levels pending. [**Month (only) 8**] need ID consult to further sort out
   whether his fevers represent an active infectious process.
   Pt is critically ill.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent.
   - Lumbar/Sacral imaging yesterday, awaiting final read
   -will likely be consulting ID today
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia. NO
   evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated, wean prn
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch
   - back imaging to r/o infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has undergone extensive workup for FUO, including a PET scan that showed increased uptake in the marrow and spleen, as well as a positive Galucan test. He has been exposed to zosyn recently, but the level of positivity seems higher than expected. The patient has also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) treated with ceftriaxone. Repeat urine analysis showed only yeast. He is currently on heparin sodium infusion and receiving various medications including lansoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.
2. Right IJ Throbus: The patient has a known thrombus in the right internal jugular vein.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia.
4. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers for two months without a clear source of infection.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm is in AFIB.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, and a right internal jugular thrombus. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He has a language barrier. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a right internal jugular thrombus indicates a potential risk for DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity suggests an increased risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently elevated, indicating hypertension.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistent hyperglycemia, which can lead to further complications if not managed effectively.
6. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fever without an identified source increases the risk of developing an infection or sepsis.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent.
   - Lumbar/Sacral imaging today.
   -will likely be consulting ID and rheum
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia. NO
   evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple medical issues including hyperglycemia, right internal jugular thrombus, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, and a history of autoimmune myopathy (AMS).

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and persistent FUO. He was previously treated at another hospital for AMS, fevers, and respiratory failure, and was transferred here due to the inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent FUO.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 131/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Electrolyte levels indicate hypernatremia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient has a history of being exposed to zosyn, but the level of positivity seems higher than expected. He has a positive glucan assay and pending galactomannan test"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (altered mental status), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He has been admitted to the ICU for his inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has undergone extensive workup for FUO, including LP (lumbar puncture), ehrlichia, q-fever, and a trial of therapy with doxycycline. A PET scan showed increased uptake in the marrow and spleen, and the patient tested positive for glucan, indicating a possible fungal infection. He has also been exposed to Zosyn recently, which can cause false-positive results for glucan. Galactomannan is still pending.

The patient has been treated with 7 days of Zosyn for a urinary tract infection (UTI), and repeat urine analysis shows only yeast. Heme/onc (hematology/oncology) is willing to pursue a bone marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found. Back exam revealed tenderness at the sacrum, and lumbar/sacral imaging was ordered today.

Respiratory failure: The patient has been tolerating pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation (PMV) and spontaneous tidal volume (STV) during the day for several weeks at another hospital but required pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night. He required resting on PSV several days now"

   tolerating ventilator wean, MS changes, intermittent fevers.
   Transferred here due to concerns of TBM, which was confirmed by
   bronchoscopy earlier this week. New developments include that his LS
   spine MRI has returned with a preliminary read for sacral osteomyelitis
   & myositis. Have requested ID consult. His acute respiratory failure
   remains mostly unchanged, with his tolerating TC during the day but
   requiring PSV overnight. This may not improve until his TBM is fixed,
   but will need to clarify infectious issues first.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a prolonged hospitalization due to acute respiratory failure, TBM (tuberculosis of the spine), and FUO (fever of unknown origin). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support and has shown tolerance to tracheal collar during the day but requires CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation) at night. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 132/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a sinus rhythm and an increased respiratory system compliance. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range. The patient has abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. 

Imaging studies reveal no significant changes on chest X-ray and an MRI of the lower spine pending. Microbiology tests, including fungal blood cultures and galactomannan, are also pending. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. FUO: The patient has persistent fever despite extensive workup, including a positive beta-glucan, raising concern for a fungal infection. Further microbiology tests are pending. 
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to prior pneumonia, underlying T"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a prolonged hospitalization, acute respiratory failure with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been tolerating a tracheostomy collar during the day and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/61 mmHg to 149/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's weight has increased to 134 kg, and fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,738 mL, with outputs including 1,311 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 777 mL through blood products, and 325 mL through intravenous fluids. The patient's urine output is 2,825 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of -87 mL.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 10.6-12.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 27.6-34.0%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 426-51 K/uL. Renal function tests indicate a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8-1.4 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and imaging studies are provided.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current issues include FUO, acute respiratory failure with TBM, and altered mental status (AMS). The plan includes further evaluation for infectious sources, including fungal blood cultures and galactomannan testing. An MRI of the lumbar spine is pending to assess for possible spinal tenderness. A CT torso without source of infection is also planned. If fevers persist without a clear cause, a possible bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) by Hematology/Oncology may be considered later this week.

For the acute respiratory failure, the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, and plans include tracheostomy placement once infectious issues are resolved. The AMS appears reasonable, with interactive but variable following of commands. No acute intervention is needed at this time, and sedatives should be minimized.

ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent.
   - Lumbar/Sacral imaging suggests discitis, osteomyelitis, myositis.
   -ID consulted, re: bone bx, repeat B-glucan, then start abx.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia. NO
   evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated, wean prn
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation

   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch
   - LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute memory syndrome), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He has been experiencing persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has undergone extensive testing including LP (lumbar puncture), ehrlichia, q-fever, and a PET scan. The PET scan showed increased uptake in the marrow and spleen. The patient also has a positive B-glucan test, indicating a possible fungal infection, and a pending galactomannan test, which is used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for a UTI (urinary tract infection) and has been exposed to Zosyn (ceftriaxone). Repeat urine analysis shows only yeast. He has a history of a right internal jugular vein thrombus and is receiving heparin therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he has chronic respiratory failure and tracheobronchomalacia. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation and requires PSV (pressure support ventilation) at night. An IP bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate for tracheomalacia, but no evidence of pulmonary infection was found.

The patient is also experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and suspected delirium. His EEG showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and he is being treated with haloperidol as needed for agitation.

The patient's other medical conditions include"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old obese male with a history of multiple medical issues. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient has been diagnosed with lumbosacral spine discitis and osteomyelitis, and he also has myositis of the posterior spinal musculature from L4 to L/S junction. There are concerns about possible complications such as right internal jugular thrombosis, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right IJ Thrombosis: The presence of a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein can lead to complications like pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
2. Hyperglycemia: High blood sugar levels can increase the risk of infections, slow wound healing, and damage organs over time.
3. Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels in the blood can cause dehydration, confusion, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): An unexplained persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which can be serious if not identified and treated promptly.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): This heart rhythm disorder can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   trached and peged here for fevers, respiratory failure transferred here
   for inability to wean from vent and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive today at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to
   zosyn recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than
   what would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  Heme/onc willing to pursue bone
   marrow biopsy in a few days if no clear source of fevers is found.
   Back exam revealed only tenderess at sacrum.
   - f/u culture data
   - Heme/Onc following for possible BMBx later this week
   - no antibiotics for now
   - f/u galactomannan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent.
   - Lumbar/Sacral imaging suggests discitis, osteomyelitis, myositis.
   -ID consulted, re: bone bx, repeat B-glucan, then start abx.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia. NO
   evidence of pulmonary infection at present.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated, wean prn
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall hadimprovement
   ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG from [**Hospital1 25**]
   2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.

   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed

    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for inability to wean from the ventilator and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been exposed to Zosyn recently, but the level of positivity seems higher than expected. He was treated with ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI), and repeat urine analysis shows only yeast. The patient has also been experiencing back pain and sciatica, which are well-controlled with fentanyl. His current medications include lorazepam, haloperidol, diltiazem, metoprolol, insulin, and heparin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 130/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. Imaging studies suggest discitis, osteomyelitis, and myositis in the lumbar spine region. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's imaging studies suggest discitis, osteomyelitis, and myos"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tracheostomy, and peg tube. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO).

The patient has been experiencing delirium, likely secondary to AMS, prolonged hospital stay, and ongoing FUO. His mental status has shown improvement but is still not at baseline. An EEG from 2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.

The patient also has several medical complications such as myositis, osteomyelitis, severe multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, sciatica, anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and thrombus in the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). He is currently on heparin sodium infusion and will be bridged to coumadin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/64 mmHg to 159/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a prolonged hospital stay for new onset renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure following tracheostomy, delirium, and thrombus in the inferior vena cava. He was transferred to this hospital from rehab due to continued fevers, delirium, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's creatinine levels have normalized, and delirium is resolving. Tracheobronchomalacea management is being pursued with an interventional procedure consultation who plans on bronchial stent placement once infectious issues are addressed. Ventilation status is tracheostomy collar by day pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight for sleep-disordered breathing.

The patient has a history of sacral osteomyelitis diagnosed on 8/12, with an infectious disease consultation to help define antibiotic course. Once infectious issues settle, the patient will need a bronchial stent from interventional pulmonology and then to rehab.

24-hour events are unchanged. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was on 8/13 at 12:50 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), current temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 89 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 139/63 to 159/95 mmHg"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent FUO.
   .
   FUO.  Patient has had extensive FUO workup at [**Hospital3 2241**] in [**Month (only) 8**]-[**Month (only) 1646**]
   including LP, ehrlichia, q-fever, trial of therapy with doxy.  PET scan
   reportedly showed increased uptake in marrow and spleen.  His Glucan
   returned positive at greater than assay.  He has been exposed to zosyn
   recently, but this level of positivity seems to be higher than what
   would expect to see with zosyn exposure.  Galactomanan is still
   pending.  Patient was treated with 7 days of Zosyn
 ceftriaxone for
   UTI.  Repeat UA shows only yeast.  MRI of sacrum showed likely
   osteomyelitis and myositis.
   - ID consulted, appreciate recs
   - f/u culture data, daily survelience cultures
   - no antibiotics for now, will pursue bone biopsy
   - f/u galactomannan, resend glucan
   - CT torso to look for infectious source-nothing apparent..
   -heme onc was following for FUO workup, but will likely defer BM biopsy
   at this time
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has been tolerating PMV and TCM during
   days for several weeks at [**Hospital1 25**], but patient required PSV at night.
   Patient was initially doing well after trach size increased but
   required resting on PSV several days now.  Additionally, had high
   tracheal pressure with PMV use.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  IP bronched  to evaluate for trachemalacia which is
   severe.
   - saw evidence of TBM, will need 2 part stenting, awaiting no evidence
   of infection first.
   - continue trach mask as tolerated, wean prn
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing FUO for two months with
   no clear source of infection.  Prior LP has been non-diagnostic.  Head
   CTs have been negative in the past.  Patient has overall had
   improvement ofmental status, but still not at baseline per wife.  EEG
   from [**Hospital1 25**] 2 months ago showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - haldol prn agitation
 not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and initiation
   of metoprolol a few days ago
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - increase glargine and HISS
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia.
   - anemia studies
   - ferritin above level of assay; likely reactive (source unknown now,
   does have decub ulcers)
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   Today complaining of back pain, but difficult to clarify
   nature and source of pain.  Will avoid increasing pain medications so
   as not to [**Last Name (un) 4556**] the pain.
   - continue fentanyl patch
   - LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Getting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin , then coumadin bridging, hold coumadin in light of upcoming
   procedure

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, respiratory failure, and prolonged hospital stay. He has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy and peg tube placement after pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the ICU for fevers and respiratory failure and has been unable to wean from the ventilator. He has persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO) and extensive workup at another hospital including lumbar puncture, ehrlichia, and Q-fever tests. A PET scan showed increased uptake in the marrow and spleen. His glucan level was positive, and he has been exposed to zosyn recently. The patient was treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been on heparin for a right iliac joint thrombus. 

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to fevers, prolonged hospital stay, and AMS. His mental status has shown some improvement but is still not at baseline. He requires regular monitoring and occasional haloperidol for agitation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He initially tolerated pressure-controlled ventilation (PMV) and spontaneous tidal volume (STV) during the day but required pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night. Tracheal pressure was also high with PMV use."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR in AM.  Ortho
   feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR and CRP are markedly
   elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic evidence of lumbar
   myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy
   - consider tagged WBC scan if bone biopsy is negative
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fevers and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), pneumonia, ARDS, and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to an inability to wean from the vent. The patient also has osteomyelitis/myositis, as indicated by an MRI of the lumbar spine showing discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis. The patient has persistent fevers for two months and elevated ESR and CRP levels.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. A tracheal stent placement is planned after completing the infectious workup.

2. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has osteomyelitis/myositis, with an MRI showing discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to AMS and prolonged hospital stay. Monitoring of mental status is recommended, along with the use of Haldol as needed for agitation.

4. Heart Rate Stability: The patient's heart rate is relatively stable with HRs in the 90s-110s on maximum dose diltiazem and intermediate dose metoprolol. Adjustments to medication dos"

   - ortho consulted for bone biopsy, deferred biopsy to CT guided biopsy
   by neuroradiology; they were overall unsure of the diagnosis of osteo
   based on MRI, suggested a tagged WBC scan prior to biopsy because if
   negative, still cannot be certain it is not osteo
   - neuroradiolgist will likely be able to do a biopsy on Monday,
   although the requistion will be reviewed on Monday morning, so the
   fellow said don't stop the heparin or tube feeds until we're called
   that day; the attending will be in around 730 or 8 am

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for fevers and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing persistent fevers for two months, which are likely secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis. The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient's persistent fevers and elevated inflammatory markers suggest a possible infection in the bones or muscles. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of pneumonia and ARDS. Weaning from the ventilator has been challenging due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement is planned to address TBM after completing the infectious workup.

3. Delirium: The patient's ongoing fevers and prolonged hospital stay may contribute to delirium. Close monitoring of mental status and the use of haloperidol as needed can help manage agitation.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and his hemoglobin (Hct"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of fever of unknown origin (FUO), respiratory failure, and evidence of osteomyelitis on MRI. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent coughing while on transport (TC), and his vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/75mmHg to 179/114mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including lorazepam, haloperidol, heparin, vit D, prevacid, calcium, fentanyl patch, and diltiazem. He also has various IV lines and tubes in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab values indicate potential issues with sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and liver function.

The patient has several medical complications, including osteomyelitis, hyperglycemia, right internal jugular thrombus, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia.

The plan moving forward includes a bone biopsy to rule out osteomyelitis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR in AM.  Ortho
   feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR and CRP are markedly
   elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic evidence of lumbar
   myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy
   - consider tagged WBC scan if bone biopsy is negative
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement after pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has been experiencing fevers for two months and has shown radiographic evidence of lumbar myositis. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. If the bone biopsy is negative, a tagged WBC scan may be considered. Antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl) should be initiated if the patient decompensates.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement for TBM is planned after completing the infectious workup. The patient requires resting on pressure support (PS) during the nights. Tracheal stent placement will be considered following the infectious workup to rule out active infection.

3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to AMS and prolonged hospital stay. Monitoring mental status and using haloperidol as needed for agitation are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of obesity, who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is tracheostomized and receiving mechanical ventilation via CPAP/PSV mode. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococcus. There are ongoing concerns regarding his mental status and the decision to stop fentanyl patches has been made to evaluate for improvement. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is tachycardic with a heart rate of 105 bpm. His respiratory support parameters are within acceptable limits, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%. The patient has received various infusions, including heparin sodium, lorazepam, and other medications. Fluid balance and oxygen delivery are being closely monitored. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, while other parameters are within normal ranges. There is a plan to perform a bone biopsy for gram stain and culture, as well as a galactomannan test. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds, and measures are in place to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR in AM.  Ortho
   feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR and CRP are markedly
   elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic evidence of lumbar
   myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy, however unable to  be obtained today.
   Rads suggests repeat MRI.
   - consider tagged WBC scan if bone biopsy is negative
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs, will ask ID re: abx in setting of bone bx not
   occurring.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Vomiting-will obtain KUB, hold TFs, zofran.
   -lipase
   .
   Rhonchi-could be related to aspiration. Will obtain CXR.
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute mental status changes), fevers, and respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and peg tube placement after pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. The patient is currently in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent infections secondary to osteomyelitis/myositis.
3. Imaging studies, including an L-spine MRI, have shown likely discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis. The patient's ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are markedly elevated.
4. The patient's respiratory status has improved with an increasing size of the tracheostomy tube, but he still requires resting on pressure support (PS) during the nights.
5. The patient has ongoing fevers for two months, likely secondary to osteo/myositis. The medical team is planning a bone biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis.
6. The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to a cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement is planned after completing the infectious workup.
7. The patient has OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and obesity hypoventilation. Tracheal stent placement is also"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57M morbid obesity, chronic respiratory
   failure, fevers / sepsis possibly from osteo. Two episodes of emesis,
   TFs are on hold.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.7 BP 140/70 HR 90 RR 18 with sat 99 on PSV 8/5.
   Obese man, NAD. Coarse BS, new ronchi B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+ edema.
   R power PICC. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 28, K+ 3.7, Cr 1.1.
   Agree with plan to manage recurrent fevers with bone bx for possible
   osteo - will confirm with IR today, ID input appreciated, will hold off
   on abx for now. For chronic respiratory failure, continue TM trials
   with low level PSV overnight; at some point, may benefit from tracheal
   stent. Continue dilt and metoprolol for MAT. Will need G-tube replaced
   by IR today. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), sleep-disordered breathing, and possible sacral osteomyelitis +/- discitis and myositis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of IP intervention for TBM.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is a suspicion of sepsis possibly related to osteomyelitis. He has had two episodes of emesis, and tube feeds are currently on hold. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 148/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 40%. The patient's general appearance is non-acutely distressed, with normal heart sounds and peripheral pulses. The respiratory exam reveals coarse bilateral rhonchi. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurologically, the patient is lethargic and less responsive.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include managing recurrent fevers with a bone biopsy to confirm possible osteomyelitis, continuing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old individual with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and sleep-disordered breathing. They were admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation of an intervention for TBM but were found to have possible sacral osteomyelitis +/- discitis and myositis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: This is an infection of the bone that can lead to severe pain, swelling, and potentially spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.
2. Discitis: This refers to inflammation of the intervertebral discs, which can cause severe back pain and neurological symptoms if not addressed properly.
3. Myositis: This is inflammation of the muscles, which can result in muscle weakness and pain. It may be associated with difficulty breathing in this patient.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): TBM is a condition characterized by weakness and collapse of the walls of the trachea and bronchi. This can lead to recurrent respiratory infections and respiratory distress.
5. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: This is an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
6. RIJ thrombus: The presence of a thrombus in the renal inferior junction can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if it dislodges.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR in AM.  Ortho
   feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR and CRP are markedly
   elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic evidence of lumbar
   myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy, however unable to  be obtained today.
   Rads suggests repeat MRI.
   - consider tagged WBC scan if bone biopsy is negative
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs, will ask ID re: abx in setting of bone bx not
   occurring.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Vomiting-will obtain KUB, hold TFs, zofran.
   -lipase
   .
   Rhonchi-could be related to aspiration. Will obtain CXR.
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, and respiratory failure. He has undergone a tracheostomy and peg tube placement after pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the ICU for fevers and persistent respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has likely discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis, as evidenced by an MRI of the L-spine. The ESR and CRP are markedly elevated, and there is radiographic evidence of lumbar myositis. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to a cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). He is awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after completing an infectious workup. The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

3. Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing vomiting, and KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) imaging will be obtained to evaluate the cause. Lipase levels will also be checked.

4. Rhonchi: The patient has rhonchi in his lungs, which could be related to aspiration. A chest X-ray will be obtained to further evaluate this.

5. Delirium: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR in AM.  Ortho
   feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR and CRP are markedly
   elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic evidence of lumbar
   myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy, however unable to  be obtained today.
   Rads suggests repeat MRI.
   - consider tagged WBC scan if bone biopsy is negative
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs, will ask ID re: abx in setting of bone bx not
   occurring.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also hasOSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Vomiting-will obtain KUB, hold TFs, zofran.
   -lipase
   .
   Rhonchi-could be related to aspiration. Will obtain CXR.
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatica which is well controlled with
   fentanyl.   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute muscle syndrome), fevers, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement after pneumonia and ARDS. He has been admitted to the ICU for persistent fevers, respiratory failure, and inability to wean from the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has been diagnosed with discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis in the L-spine, which is evident from the MRI findings. The elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) levels indicate an inflammatory response. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. If the bone biopsy is negative, a tagged WBC scan may be considered to evaluate for osteomyelitis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to a cuff leak and TBM (tracheobronchomalacia). A y-stent placement is planned for TBM after completing the infectious workup. The patient requires resting on pressure support (PS) during the nights. Tracheostomy mask should be continued as tolerated during the days and resting on PS overnight.

3. Vomiting: The patient is experiencing vomiting, and KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) tests, along with lipase"

   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   FUO
 now think it is likely secondary to osteo, as discussed below.
   Not definite, though.  Fever curve trending down this week, no spikes
   since [**8-9**].  Continue to monitor, and continue to pursue osteo workup
   with WBC scan.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR hopefully at
   some point.  Ortho feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR
   and CRP are markedly elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic
   evidence of lumbar myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy, although awaiting bx next week.
   - will do WBC tagged scan to assess L5/S1 in setting of somewhat
   equivocal MRI
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs, will ask ID re: abx in setting of bone bx not
   occurring.
   .
   Increased Sputum Production
 no fever, leukocytosis, although GS on
   sputum shows GNRs, which have not been present before.  No abx for now,
   continue to monitor clinically.  If new high fever or respiratory
   decompensation, would cover broadly for VAP.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Vomiting- KUB equivocal, no obvious reason, having bowel movements.
   LFTs mildly elevated, lipase normal.
   -restart tube feeds after replaced in IR today (foley switched to
   actually GTube)
   - monitor clinically, worrisome for possible aspiration after he
   vomitted

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, tracheostomy, and peg tube after pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and persistent fevers secondary to osteomyelitis/myositis. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has persistent fevers for two months, and imaging shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis. Elevated ESR and CRP indicate inflammation, and low CK levels are inconsistent with radiographic evidence of lumbar myositis. A bone biopsy is recommended, but the tagged WBC scan is being pursued first to assess L5/S1.
2. Increased Sputum Production: The patient has increased sputum production without fever or leukocytosis. Gram stain of sputum shows GNRs, which were not present before. No antibiotics have been initiated, but broad coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) may be necessary if new high fever or respiratory decompensation occurs.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement is planned for TBM after completing infectious workup. Tracheostomy size has been increased"

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics (haloperidol and lorazepam), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is negative for fatigue, fever, weight loss, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and emesis. The physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and overweight, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal cardiovascular examination, peripheral vascular examination, respiratory/chest examination, abdominal examination, and neurologic examination.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 57M morbid obesity, chronic respiratory
   failure, TBM, fevers of unclear origin, possibly from osteo.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.6 BP 140/70 HR 70-100 RR 14-29 with sat 99 on
   PSV 8/5. Obese man, NAD, minimally responsive. Coarse BS, new ronchi B.
   RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+ edema. R power PICC. Labs notable for WBC 9K,
   HCT 25, K+ 3.9, Cr 1.2.
   Agree with plan to manage recurrent fevers with WBC scan as next step
   as IR unsure of significance of MRI finding as well as feasibility of
   bone bx. ID input appreciated, will hold off on abx for now. For
   chronic respiratory failure, continue TM trials with low level PSV
   overnight; at some point, may benefit from tracheal stent - will
   clarify with IP team today. He may well have recurrent VAP after
   aspiration based on secretions, but CXR, WBC, and vent requirements are
   stable. Continue dilt and metoprolol for MAT, and heparin for RIJ
   thrombus. Will need G-tube replaced by IR today. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 35 min
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of pneumonia (PNA), tracheostomy (TRACH), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), fever of unknown origin (FUO), and ventilator dependence. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to higher fevers, possibly from a urinary tract infection (UTI) or osteomyelitis, and tuberculosis (TBM).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 154/79 to 191/79 mmHg, heart rate between 76-104 bpm, respiratory rate between 14-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 765 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status, renal failure (as indicated by elevated creatinine levels), coagulopathy (elevated PT and PTT), hyperglycemia (high glucose levels), and hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels).

The patient's imaging shows a possible new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, along with a persistent retrocardiac opacity. The sputum culture is pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of fever and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and language barrier, making it difficult to obtain a detailed medical history. 

24-hour events include PEG insertion, GT replacement, restart of tube feedings (TFs), and tolerance of tracheostomy mask throughout the day. The patient continues to have thick green secretions and is experiencing more fatigue and tachypnea around 3 am, with an ABG showing pH 7.45, PCO2 30, PO2 72, and HCO3- 18. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 167/75 to 175/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's weight is currently 134.4 kg, and height is 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,236 mL and output of 965 mL since midnight. 

Respiratory support includes the use of a tracheostomy mask, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, tidal volume of 765 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - avoid abx for now
   - tagged rbc scan
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensates
   - ID following
   - check ESR/CRP to evaluate for trend
   - f/u repeat glucan
   .
   Increased Sputum Production.  Patient has been afebrile and has not had
   leukocytosis, although GS on sputum shows GNRs, which have not been
   present before.  No abx for now, continue to monitor clinically.  If
   new high fever or respiratory decompensation, would cover broadly for
   VAP.
   - f/u cultures
   - serial CXR to evaluate for infiltrate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of AMS (acute myeloid syndrome), fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) insertion. He continues to have thick green secretions, elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), and persistent fevers of unclear etiology. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient's fever and elevated inflammatory markers suggest the possibility of osteomyelitis and myositis, which are infections affecting the bones and muscles. A tagged RBC scan is planned to evaluate the extent of involvement and determine if treatment or biopsy is necessary.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has an increased production of sputum, showing GNRs (gram-negative rods) but no leukocytosis. VAP is a potential complication due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation. Monitoring for new high fever or respiratory decompensation would prompt broad coverage for VAP.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement is planned after completing the infectious workup. The patient requires resting on positive end-expiratory pressure (PS)"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   FUO
 now think it is likely secondary to osteo, as discussed below.
   Not definite, though.  Fever curve trending down this week, no spikes
   since [**8-9**].  Continue to monitor, and continue to pursue osteo workup
   with WBC scan.
   .
   Osteo/Myositis.  L-spine MRI shows likely discitis/osteomyelitis and
   myositis and has had persistent fevers for two months.   ID
   recommending bone biopsy, which will likely be done by IR hopefully at
   some point.  Ortho feels this may be discitis rather than osteo.  ESR
   and CRP are markedly elevated.  CK is low in spite of radiographic
   evidence of lumbar myositis.
   - no abx pending Bone biopsy, although awaiting bx next week.
   - will do WBC tagged scan to assess L5/S1 in setting of somewhat
   equivocal MRI
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensating
   - appreciate ID recs, will ask ID re: abx in setting of bone bx not
   occurring.
   .
   Increased Sputum Production
 no fever, leukocytosis, although GS on
   sputum shows GNRs, which have not been present before.  No abx for now,
   continue to monitor clinically.  If new high fever or respiratory
   decompensation, would cover broadly for VAP.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Vomiting- KUB equivocal, no obvious reason, having bowel movements.
   LFTs mildly elevated, lipase normal.
   -restart tube feeds after replaced in IR today (foley switched to
   actually GTube)
   - monitor clinically, worrisome for possible aspiration after he
   vomitted
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with AMS (altered mental status), fevers, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. He underwent tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) insertion. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers for two months, which are likely secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis. His condition has been complicated by increased sputum production, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, tracheal stenosis, vomiting, delirium, and sciatica.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient's persistent fevers and MRI findings suggest discitis/osteomyelitis and myositis. A bone biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis, and a tagged WBC scan will be done to assess the L5/S1 region.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): With the presence of increased sputum production and GNRs (gram-negative rods) on sputum culture, there is a risk of developing VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed if the patient shows signs of respiratory decompensation.

3. Tracheal Stenosis: The patient's difficulty weaning from the ventilator and the need for a tracheal stent placement indicate tracheal stenosis. Infectious workup will be completed before proceeding with the stent placement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of complex hospitalizations, fever of unknown origin (FUO), tuberculosis (TBM), and possible sacral osteomyelitis.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, which are now resolving after several days of antibiotic treatment.
- The patient also has severe TBM and there are concerns about the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is currently on tracheal mask ventilation with ABG values showing adequate oxygenation.
- The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeds, and his glycemic control is well-managed.
- The patient has multiple lines and drains in place, including a PICC line, and is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin.
- Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent VAP.
- The patient's family has been informed and consent for ICU care has been obtained.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's severe TBM and recent intubation put him at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and implementation of appropriate preventive measures, such as elevating the HOB and performing regular mouth care, are essential.
2. Osteomyelitis:"

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there are concerns about evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

24-hour events include a discussion regarding the placement of a stent, but it was decided to wait for clarification of symptoms, especially since the patient is off the ventilator. The patient remains on a tracheostomy mask, and the peg tube has been replaced. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.6-37.7°C, heart rate between 83-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/60-149/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. 

The patient's weight is 134.4 kg, with a height of 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,236 mL and output of 1,871 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,271 mL. 

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 144, and oxygen delivery device is a tracheostomy mask.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - avoid abx for now
   - tagged rbc scan
   - vanco/cipro/flagyl if decompensates
   - ID following
   - check ESR/CRP to evaluate for trend
   - f/u repeat glucan
   .
   Increased Sputum Production.  Patient has been afebrile and has not had
   leukocytosis, although GS on sputum shows GNRs, which have not been
   present before.  No abx for now, continue to monitor clinically.  If
   new high fever or respiratory decompensation, would cover broadly for
   VAP.
   - f/u cultures
   - serial CXR to evaluate for infiltrate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   - d/c fentanyl patch as patient is currently denying pain
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - d/c fentanyl patch with hopes for improvement of mental status
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed
   .

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient presented with fevers, worsening respiratory secretions, and new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with plans to tailor antibiotic therapy based on sputum culture results. 

The patient's blood culture through the percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line was positive for gram-negative rods in the aerobic bottle. His urine culture was also positive, despite Foley catheter replacement. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate in the 20s, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.1 thousand/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are within normal range. 

The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, likely secondary to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), fevers, and prolonged"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Started on vanco/cefepime yesterday.
   - await final culture data and sensitivies
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with e.coli; source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum is growing
   GNRs) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures pending.
   - continue vanco/cefepime as above
   - follow up cultures
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - abx as above
   - wbc scan today
   - if negative, can consider all his fevers to maybe be just part all
   his hospital acquired infections
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myeloid syndrome), fevers, and multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and osteomyelitis/myositis. The patient is currently in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent bacteremia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and positive sputum culture, indicating an infection in the lungs while on mechanical ventilation. He has been started on vancomycin and cefepime for treatment.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture with E. coli, suggesting a systemic infection. The source of the bacteremia is unknown but could be related to the pneumonia or urinary tract infection.

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers for two months, possibly secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis detected on an MRI of the lumbar spine. Further investigation with a tagged red blood cell scan is planned to determine if this needs to be treated or biopsied.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to a cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement for TBM is awaiting after completing the"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of two months of altered mental status (AMS), fevers, and subsequent tracheostomy and peg tube placement after pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was admitted to the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers of unclear etiology. 

The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin (FUO) secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis detected on left spin MRI. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence, and not enough bone involvement to biopsy. A tagged red blood cell scan has been ordered to decide if this needs to be treated or biopsied.

Additionally, the patient has increased sputum production, but has been afebrile and has not had leukocytosis. Gram stain on sputum shows Gram-negative rods (GNRs), which have not been present before. No antibiotics have been given, and cultures are being monitored. If new high fever or respiratory decompensation occurs, broad coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be initiated.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator caused by cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). He is awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after completing an infectious workup. The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

The patient has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and is experiencing persistent fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/44 to 159/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. The patient's weight has increased from 123 kg at admission to 134.4 kg currently.

The patient is receiving various medications including anticoagulants, antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and other ICU medications. The patient is also receiving tube feeds and has a central line in place for medication administration.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. The patient's platelet count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels are within normal range. Imaging studies show improvement in right lower lobe opacity after positive pressure ventilation, although retrocardiac opacity remains.

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to TBM and now VAP, possible osteomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Started on vanco/cefepime yesterday.
   - await final culture data and sensitivies
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with e.coli; source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum is growing
   GNRs) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures pending.
   - continue vanco/cefepime as above
   - follow up cultures
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - abx as above
   - wbc scan today
   - if negative, can consider all his fevers to maybe be just part all
   his hospital acquired infections
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myeloid syndrome), fevers, pneumonia, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He was admitted to the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers of unclear etiology. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and developed a fever, left lower lobe infiltrate, and positive sputum culture. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, awaiting final culture data and sensitivities. This indicates a possible infection in the lungs caused by hospital-acquired bacteria.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures with E. coli, the source of which is unknown. It could be related to pneumonia or urinary tract infection. He is continuing vancomycin and cefepime as above, with follow-up cultures.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's fevers may be secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis detected on an L-spine MRI. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence, and not enough bone involvement to biopsy. A tagged RBC scan is planned to decide if treatment or biopsy is needed. Elevated ESR and CRP levels and increased Glucan assay support the possibility of an ongoing infection.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient had"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Started on vanco/cefepime yesterday.
   - cipro started per ID recs, as well
   - await final culture data and sensitivies
 is enterobacter and MRSA
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum and might be
   enterobacter) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures negative
   except for yeast in urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis.  Has worsening mental status today,
   unclear why.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - will start coumadin tonight if mental status improved and not worried
   about head bleed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition, and the potential medical complications that can arise, the following information can be summarized:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myocardial infarction), fevers, who is s/p tracheostomy and peg tube after pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- He is in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers of unclear etiology.
- The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), bacteremia, and FUO (fever of unknown origin).
- He also has osteomyelitis and myositis, as detected on L-spin MRI.
- The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and TBM (tracheobronchomalacia).
- He has OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and obesity hypoventilation.
- There are concerns about delirium and AMS (acute mental status changes) secondary to fevers and prolonged hospital stay.
- The patient has anemia, sciatica, and a known right internal jugular thrombus.
- He requires ongoing respiratory support, antibiotics, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, delirium or acute mental status changes, thromboembolic events, and pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Started on vanco/cefepime yesterday.
   - await final culture data and sensitivies
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with e.coli; source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum is growing
   GNRs) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures pending.
   - continue vanco/cefepime as above
   - follow up cultures
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - abx as above
   - wbc scan today
   - if negative, can consider all his fevers to maybe be just part all
   his hospital acquired infections
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - monitor mental status
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - begin bridging to coumadin after procedures (bone biopsy) have been
   completed
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The presence of fever, infiltrate in the left lower lobe, and positive sputum culture suggests the possibility of VAP. Antibiotics have been started, but it is important to await final culture data and sensitivities to guide further treatment.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures with E. coli, indicating bacteremia. The source of infection is currently unknown, but it could be related to pneumonia or urinary tract infection. Continuing vancomycin and cefepime is recommended, and follow-up cultures should be monitored.

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers for two months, which may be secondary to osteomyelitis/myositis detected on lumbar spine MRI. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy. A tagged RBC scan has been ordered to decide if this needs to be treated or biopsied.

4. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator: The patient has had difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). A y-stent placement for TBM has been planned after completing the infectious workup.

5. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, fevers, and severe tuberculosis (TBM). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has developed new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia, possibly due to an infection with Gram-negative rods (GNR). His condition is critical, and he is unresponsive to most stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed new VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening respiratory symptoms and to ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated. Close monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
3. Tuberculosis (TBM): The patient has severe TBM, which can lead to complications such as neurological involvement and disseminated disease. Regular monitoring of symptoms and follow-up with appropriate anti-tuberculosis treatment is essential.
4. Delirium: The patient is delirious and has minimal responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Delirium is common in critically ill patients and can increase the risk of complications like falls, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers. Frequent reass"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, fevers, respiratory failure, severe tuberculous meningitis (TBM), and now presents with new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia. The patient is tracheostomized and receiving enteral nutrition. He has been critically ill and is currently on continuous heparin drip due to a suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, encephalopathy, and persistent funguria. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent development of VAP indicates a potential complication associated with mechanical ventilation. This condition requires prompt identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia suggests a systemic infection that may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring for sepsis or septic shock.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's suspected DVT poses a risk for pulmonary embolism if left untreated. The continuous heparin drip is an appropriate measure to prevent clot formation and potential embolization.

4. Delirium and encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and delirium can complicate his overall condition and make it challenging to manage his care. It is crucial to optimize sedation and consider any contributing factors such as medication effects or underlying infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.  Now
   on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum and might be
   enterobacter) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures negative
   except for yeast in urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   ddaily
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to coumadin
   bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS, fevers, pneumonia, ARDS, and tracheostomy who presented with respiratory failure and was transferred for fevers and inability to wean from the ventilator. He was found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology, possibly secondary to osteomyelitis/myositis. 

The patient has been on vancomycin/cefepime/cipro for 8 days to cover enterobacter and MRSA. The plan is to continue this antibiotic regimen for another 6 days, although it may need to be extended to 14 days due to bacteremia. 

There is also a positive blood culture with GNRs, with an unknown source, possibly from pneumonia or the urinary tract. The patient is still on vancomycin/cefepime/cipro, and the PICC line will be continued for now. If fevers persist, the need to remove the line will be considered. 

The patient's fever is most likely secondary to osteomyelitis and myositis, which was detected on L-spine MRI. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence, and not enough bone involvement to biopsy. A tagged RBC scan will be done to decide if this needs to be treated or biopsied.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but possibly secondary to
   Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Started on vanco/cefepime yesterday.
   - cipro started per ID recs, as well
   - await final culture data and sensitivies
 is enterobacter and MRSA
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum and might be
   enterobacter) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures negative
   except for yeast in urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.   Patient has ongoing fevers for two months
   likely secondary to osteo/myositis.  Has worsening mental status today,
   unclear why.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Awaiting heparin to coumadin
   bridging.
   - heparin drip
   - will start coumadin tonight if mental status improved and not worried
   about head bleed

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute memory syndrome), fevers, pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and tracheostomy.
- He was admitted for fevers, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers of unclear etiology.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has difficulty weaning from the vent due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM).
- He has been treated with antibiotics for suspected VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), bacteremia, and osteomyelitis/myositis.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is suspected to have delirium secondary to AMS and prolonged hospital stay.
- He has ongoing fevers likely secondary to osteo/myositis, and a tagged WBC scan was negative.
- The patient is awaiting Y-stent placement for TBM after completing an infectious workup.
- He has anemia, diabetes mellitus, sciatica, and a known right internal jugular thrombus.
- The patient is currently on heparin drip and will start on Coumadin tonight if his mental status improves and there are no concerns about a head bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for suspected VAP, and it is important to monitor for signs of improvement or worsening respiratory status.
2. Osteomyel"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's fever curve is trending downward.
- The patient has been experiencing somnolence but responds to painful stimuli.
- The patient's sputum is growing enterobacter and MRSA.
- The patient's family reports that they are more responsive in the afternoon.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and hyperglycemia.
- The patient has right IJ throbus, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has a PICC line and is on systemic anticoagulation with heparin.
- The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of enterobacter and MRSA in the sputum suggests a potential bacterial infection, which could lead to worsening pneumonia or other infections.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can be painful and difficult to treat.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure increases the risk of further deterioration in lung function and may require long-term ventilatory support"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.  Now
   on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum and might be
   enterobacter) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures negative
   except for yeast in urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   ddaily
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to coumadin
   bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myocardial infarction), fevers, pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and tracheostomy.
- He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and fevers of unclear etiology, possibly secondary to osteomyelitis or myositis.
- The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and bacteremia.
- He is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- Other conditions include delirium, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, sciatica, and thrombus in the right internal jugular vein.
- The patient is also receiving medications for pain management, blood pressure control, and blood glucose regulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient's persistent fevers and positive MRI findings suggest the possibility of osteomyelitis or myositis. Further evaluation with a tagged RBC scan is planned to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia. A y-stent placement is awaiting completion of the infectious workup to rule out active infection.
3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to AMS, prolonged hospital stay, and low-grade fe"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   .
   VAP.  Pt with fever,LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.  Now
   on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro
   .
   Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia (as sputum and might be
   enterobacter) or could be from urine, as UA positive, cultures negative
   except for yeast in urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   .
   FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent due
   to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   ddaily
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to coumadin
   bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU with fevers, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy and peg tube placement. The patient is currently receiving treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. He also has bacteremia with Gram-negative rods, which is being treated with the same antibiotics. Additionally, the patient has osteomyelitis/myositis, as evidenced by positive MRI findings, but no bone involvement for biopsy. A tagged white blood cell scan was negative, indicating no current infection. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). He is awaiting a Y-stent placement for TBM after completing the infectious workup. The patient has a tracheostomy and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. He requires resting on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during the nights due to ongoing respiratory distress. 

The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to AMS and prolonged hospital stay. He is currently on haloperidol as needed for agitation and will be started on citalopram upon discharge. 

The patient's heart rate is overall improved with the"

   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   .
   Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   .
   MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   .
   DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   .
    Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   .
    Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose.
   -appears to be having pain today, will start oxycodone prn.
   .
   Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to coumadin
   bridging today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute memory syndrome), pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), tracheostomy, and peg tube. He was admitted for fevers and respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), bacteremia, and FUO (fever of unknown origin). He also has osteomyelitis/myositis, which is suspected to be the cause of the fever. The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). He is awaiting a Y-stent placement for TBM after completing the infectious workup. The patient has delirium, which is improving. He is on multiple medications including Haldol, Seroquel, celexa, diltiazem, metoprolol, glargine, and HISS. The patient has anemia, sciatica, and a known right internal jugular vein thrombus. He is being bridged from heparin to coumadin. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been diagnosed with VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.
2. Osteomyelitis/myositis: The patient has suspected osteomyel"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis (TBM), recurrent pneumonia (PNA), and respiratory failure. He has been hospitalized for a long duration and underwent rehabilitation for his condition. Currently, the patient is experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia but has shown substantial improvement with antibiotic treatment. 

The patient's mental status has improved, but he requires haloperidol for agitation. He is more awake and cooperative in the morning. The patient received a 1-liter fluid bolus. He has no known drug allergies. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/53 mmHg to 145/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His weight is currently 134.4 kg, and his height is 70 inches. 

The patient has received various medications, including heparin sodium, cefepime, lansoprazole, metoprolol, diltiazem, ciprofloxacin, fentanyl, warfarin, sertraline, and escitalopram. 

The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted improvements and complications. His review of systems is also unchanged, except for the presence of fevers and hyperglycemia. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 4,495 mL of fluids, including 1,846 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 2,049 mL through intravenous fluids, and 339 mL through other sources. The patient has excreted a total of 2,520 mL of urine and 1,550 mL of blood products. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through CPAP mode on the ventilator, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 12 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 50.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro for now, but can likely do vanco for
   8hrs and cipro for 14 days.
   - f/u ID
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above, likely can tailor to cipro
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - will ask for new PICC today, if old removed will send for cx.
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent
   due to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   #  Normocytic Anemia. HCT 21.3 this am.
   - follow Hct, transfuse <21
   - fe c/w inflammatory blockade; will check  b12, folate, stool guaiacs.
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose.
   # Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to
   coumadin bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), fevers, and pneumonia who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and respiratory failure, leading to the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has also been found to have bacteremia, possibly secondary to osteomyelitis or myositis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Other medical conditions include delirium, normocytic anemia, delirium, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, sciatica, and a right internal jugular thrombus. The patient is currently on a heparin drip and bridging therapy with coumadin.

Plan:
1. Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for the treatment of VAP and bacteremia.
2. Consider tailoring antibiotic therapy based on culture results.
3. Remove PICC line if continued fevers persist.
4. Perform a tagged RBC scan to evaluate for osteomyelitis or myositis.
5. Treat current infection and reevaluate after the tagged RBC scan.
6. Place a tracheal stent after completing infectious workup.
7. Continue tracheostomy mask during the day and resting on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at night"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro for now, but can likely do vanco for
   8hrs and cipro for 14 days.
   - f/u ID
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above, likely can tailor to cipro
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - will ask for new PICC today, if old removed will send for cx.
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent
   due to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   #  Normocytic Anemia. HCT 21.3 this am.
   - follow Hct, transfuse <21
   - fe, b12, folate, stool guaiacs.
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose.
   # Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to
   coumadin bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro for now, but can likely do vanco for 8
   days and cipro for 14 days
   - will recheck vanc level in a.m.
   - ID reccs double coverage for enterobacter but will clarify whether
   able to d/c cefepime or ciprofloxacin
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cipro/cefepime as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - f/u blood cultures
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal

   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on CPAP
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   #  Normocytic Anemia. HCT 21.3 this am and s/p transfusion of 1u PRBC
   overnight.  Has been guaiac negative.
   - follow Hct, transfuse <21
   - decrease heparin gtt rate for PTT goal of 60
   - fe c/w inflammatory blockade; will check  b12, folate, stool guaiacs.
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   # Hypercalcemia:  Calcium level rising to 13 adjusted for albumin from
   normal baseline.
   - will hold calcium and vitamin D for now
   - will defer ionized calcium, vitamin D, PTH, TSH studies for now
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose
   - start ultram, lidocaine patch
   # Line-associated thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating
   heparin to coumadin bridging.
   - heparin drip

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and fevers, who was previously intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin to cover for enterobacter and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There are concerns about bacteremia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), osteomyelitis/myositis, and normocytic anemia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with tracheostomy and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his symptoms and guide further treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It is essential to monitor his respiratory status and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures with Gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating bacteremia. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient's elevated inflammatory markers and positive MRI findings suggest the possibility of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro for now, but can likely do vanco for
   8hrs and cipro for 14 days.
   - f/u ID
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro as above, likely can tailor to cipro
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - will ask for new PICC today, if old removed will send for cx.
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infx as above and then reevaluate
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent
   due to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on PS
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   #  Anemia. Stable.
   - follow Hct
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose.
   # Thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating heparin to
   coumadin bridging today.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS, fevers, pneumonia, ARDS, and tracheostomy. He is currently in the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, and inability to wean from the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), bacteremia, and suspected osteomyelitis/myositis. He is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's condition is complicated by delirium, potential obesity hypoventilation, tracheobronchomalacia, and possibly a right iliac joint thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is caused by the aspiration of bacteria into the lungs. Symptoms include fever, increased sputum production, worsening respiratory distress, and changes in sputum color or odor. Treatment involves broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the suspected pathogens.

2. Bacteremia: Bacteremia refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. In this case, the patient has positive blood cultures with Gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating a systemic infection. Treatment involves continuing the current antibiotics and potentially tailoring them based on culture results.

3. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: These conditions involve infection of the bone and muscle,"

In the past 24 hours, the patient's alertness has improved, but they required additional medication to manage chronic back/knee/leg pain. Physical examination findings include a low-grade temperature, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurological assessment is also not complete.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/51 mmHg to 144/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with FiO2 at 40%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging studies are pending.

The patient has several potential medical complications including diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia (bacterial and ventilator-acquired), osteomyelitis, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic back pain."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with respiratory failure, tuberculosis (TBM), initially fever of unknown origin (FUO) now resolved, recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Gram-negative bacteremia, currently improving on antibiotics. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, osteomyelitis, hyperglycemia, right internal jugular vein thrombus, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has recently developed VAP with Gram-negative bacteremia, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Right internal jugular vein thrombus - The presence of a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or further thrombus extension.
3. Hypercalcemia - The patient has hypercalcemia, which can be caused by bone resorption with supplemental calcium. Stopping the supplemental calcium may help manage this condition.
4. Hypernatremia - The patient has hypernatremia, indicating high sodium levels in the blood. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.
5. Fever of unknown origin - The patient initially presented with FUO, which could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (S"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with respiratory failure, tuberculosis (TBM), initially fever of unknown origin (FUO) now resolved, recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia, now improved on antibiotics. 

The patient has several medical complications, including diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia (bacterial, ventilator-acquired), osteomyelitis, hyperglycemia, right internal jugular thrombus, hypernatremia (high sodium), fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), chronic respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing with ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin for two weeks, discussing the choice of antibiotics with the ID team. The patient will also continue on CPAP at night and tracheostomy when in a chair. The anemia is being addressed with packed red blood cells (prbc). The right internal jugular thrombus needs further evaluation regarding the need for anticoagulation. Delirium is improving, and the patient will continue on seroquel. Pain management includes fentanyl transdermal patch and oxycodone as needed, especially before sitting in a chair. The patient will also start on a lidocaine patch and ultram. Hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA (Day #7).
   - Plan for 8 day course, to finish on [**2168-8-25**].
   - F/U Vanc level this morning
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs on [**8-17**], source
   at this time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cipro/cefepime as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - f/u blood cultures
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.
   Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and Glucan was
   greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infxn as above and then reevaluate
   - Repeat B-Glucan in 3 weeks and reassess.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent
   due to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on CPAP
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   #  Normocytic Anemia. HCT 23.0  this am and s/p transfusion of 1u PRBC
   overnight.  Has been guaiac negative.
   - follow Hct, transfuse <21.  Folate and B12 were normal yesterday.
   - decrease heparin gtt rate for PTT goal of 60
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and continue Fentanyl patch at decreased level
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermediate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol to 37.5 mg TID
   # Hypercalcemia:  Calcium level rising to 13 adjusted for albumin from
   normal baseline.  Exogenous calcium was discontinued yesterday.
   - will hold calcium and vitamin D for now
   - will defer ionized calcium, vitamin D, PTH, TSH studies for now
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, with increased pain
   yesterday.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose
   - Continue ultram, lidocaine patch
   # Line-associated thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   U/S
   yesterday did not show evidence of current clot, so anticoagulation was
   discontinued yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute memory syndrome), fevers, pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and tracheostomy. He has been admitted for fevers, respiratory failure, and inability to wean from the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), bacteremia, and FUO (fever of unknown origin). He is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to cuff leak and TBM (tracheobronchomalacia). He requires resting on positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) during nights.
2. Osteomyelitis/Myositis: The patient has positive MRI findings suggesting osteo and myositis. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is rising to 13 adjusted for albumin from normal baseline.
4. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to fevers and prolonged hospital stay.
5. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia (ventilator-acquired), osteomyelitis, hyperglycemia, right internal jugular thrombosis, hypernatremia, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, back pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving care for these conditions. The patient has received antibiotics (cefepime, ciprofloxacin) and anticoagulation therapy has been stopped as there is no evidence of clot on the right internal jugular ultrasound. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/102 to 155/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 134.4 kg, with a height of 70 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,546 mL and output of 1,740 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving CPAP ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40% and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 52. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and sodium levels. Other labs are within normal ranges"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7946**] is a 57 year old male with 2 months of AMS, fevers, who is
   s/p trached and peg after pneumonia and ARDS, here for fevers,
   respiratory failure transferred here for inability to wean from vent
   found to have VAP and persistent fevers of unclear etiology but
   possibly secondary to Osteomyelitis/myositis.
   # VAP.  Pt with fever, LLL infiltrate, and positive sputum culture.
   Now on vanco/cefepime/cipro to cover enterobacter and MRSA.
   - plan for 8 day course, although may have to extend to 14 days
   secondary to bacteremia.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/cipro for now, but can likely do vanco for 8
   days and cipro for 14 days
   - will recheck vanc level in a.m.
   - ID reccs double coverage for enterobacter but will clarify whether
   able to d/c cefepime or ciprofloxacin
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Bacteremia.  Pt with positive blood culture with GNRs, source at this
   time unknown, although could be from pneumonia or urine.
   - continue vanco/cipro/cefepime as above
   - continue with PICC line for now, if continued fevers need to consider
   removing
   - f/u blood cultures
   # FUO.  Curently felt most likely to be secondary to osteo and myositis
   which was detected on L-spin MRI.  However, there is minimal
   radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to biopsy.  Will
   pursue tagged RBC scan to decide if this needs to be treated or
   biopsied.  Additionally, ESR and CRP are persistently elevated and
   Glucan was greater than assay.
   - tagged wbc scan negative
   - will now need to treat current infxn as above and then reevaluate
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient had had difficulty weaning from vent
   due to cuff leak and TBM.  Awaiting y-stent placement for TBM after
   infectious workup is completed.  Also has OSA and ?obesity
   hypoventilation.  Increasing size of trach resulted in some improvement
   of respiratory status, but requires resting on PS during the nights.
   - awaiting tracheal stent placement following infectious workup to rule
   out active infection
   - plan on stent as outpatient, will have appt 1 month after discharge;
   should pg IP fellow on discharge to help set up appt
   - continue trach mask as tolerated during the days, resting on CPAP
   overnight, doing well with 10 peep o/n.
   #  Normocytic Anemia. HCT 21.3 this am and s/p transfusion of 1u PRBC
   overnight.  Has been guaiac negative.
   - follow Hct, transfuse <21
   - decrease heparin gtt rate for PTT goal of 60
   - fe c/w inflammatory blockade; will check  b12, folate, stool guaiacs.
   # Delerium.  Suspect AMS is related to delerium secondary to fevers and
   prolonged hospital stay. Improving.
   - haldol prn agitation though not requiring any
   - stop ativan and decrease Fentanyl patch
   - if not improving, consider head CT
   - initiate home celexa with plan to uptitrate to prior dose of 60 mg
   daily
   -seroquel 12.5mg qam and 25mg qpm for now.
   # MAT.  HRs overall improved to 90s-110s on max dose dilt and
   intermidiate dose metoprolol.  Likely related to respiratory status and
   to low grade fevers.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
 consider switching to long acting if patient
   remains stable
   - increase metoprolol as needed
   # Hypercalcemia:  Calcium level rising to 13 adjusted for albumin from
   normal baseline.
   - will hold calcium and vitamin D for now
   - will defer ionized calcium, vitamin D, PTH, TSH studies for now
   # DM.  FS elevated and tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue glargine and HISS and adjust as needed, uptitrated [**8-21**]
   - follow FS
   # Sciatica.  Patient has severe sciatic, states he has no pain today.
   -LS MRI suggests osteo, discitis, myositis as well.
   - restarted fentanyl patch as pt was having pain but at
 dose
   - start ultram, lidocaine patch
   # Line-associated thrombus.  Known to have RIJ thrombus.   Initiating
   heparin to coumadin bridging.
   - heparin drip
 coumadin briding
   - will clarify whether patient needs anticoagulation for this
   line-associated thrombus given line no longer present

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of AMS (acute myeloid syndrome), fevers, pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and persistent fevers of unclear etiology, possibly secondary to osteomyelitis/myositis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation. The treatment plan includes antibiotics to cover enterobacter and MRSA for an 8-day course, although it may need to be extended to 14 days due to bacteremia.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures with GNRs (Gram-negative rods), and the source of infection is currently unknown. The ongoing treatment includes vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's PICC line will be kept in place for now, but if there are persistent fevers, removing it may be considered.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers, and the most likely cause seems to be osteomyelitis/myositis detected on L-spin MRI. However, there is minimal radiographic evidence and not enough bone involvement to"
