   Respiratory distress/hypoxia: CXR with worsening bilateral opacities
   and likely fluid overload.  CTA with no PE but significant for diffuse
   ground glass opacities.  CTA also with consolidation in the right
   middle lobe and right lower lobe which could represent infection or
   metastatic deposits to the lungs.  There is concern for lymphangitic
   spread of her breast cancer. There may also be a component of
   aspiration PNA. She did have aspiration events prior to admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9470**], a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and worsening bilateral opacities on CXR. She has a history of seizures, pneumonia (PNA), and metastatic breast cancer involving the left breast, liver, and lung. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow neb. She is experiencing diffuse bilateral rales in her lungs, tachycardia, and has a positive blood culture. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory distress/hypoxia, fever, seizures, metastatic breast cancer, elevated liver enzymes, mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient's worsening bilateral opacities on CXR, along with respiratory distress, indicate possible complications such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The presence of consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes could be indicative of infection or metastatic deposits to the lungs"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the lung, liver, and brain. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia but transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has a history of aspiration events and may have aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on contact precautions and receiving treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and tamiflu. The patient's fever is likely due to worsening pneumonia. An EEG is pending for seizure evaluation, and the patient's cerebellar dysfunction is likely related to radiation-induced necrosis. The patient's elevated liver enzymes may be due to liver metastasis. She also has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia, and her diet has been adjusted accordingly. Her anemia is stable with a current HCT of 28 and a recent baseline of 32-35. The patient is NPO until respiratory distress improves. She is on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia could worsen due to worsening bilateral opacities on CXR, fluid overload, and potential infection or metastatic deposits in the lungs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 9470] is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, including involvement in the left breast, liver, and lung. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia but was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress due to worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress is likely caused by fluid overload, as indicated by the CXR and CT angiography showing diffuse ground glass opacities and consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes, which could represent infection or metastatic deposits to the lungs. There is concern for lymphangitic spread of breast cancer, as well as aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening bilateral opacities on CXR suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and worsening lung opacities indicates a potential infection, likely aspiration pneumonia or a bacterial infection secondary to metastatic lung involvement.
3. Metastatic Spread: The consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes could represent metastatic deposits from the breast cancer, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Fluid Overload: The positive fluid balance and increased urine output suggest fluid overload, which can worsen respiratory distress and"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain, liver, and lung. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia but transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress due to worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has low oxygen saturation in the mid-90s while on a non-rebreather mask. She has diffuse late inspiratory crackles on lung examination. The patient complains of some continuous head and neck pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient's respiratory symptoms suggest a possible worsening of her condition, leading to further respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Fluid overload/pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of crackles and worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray indicate fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Infection/pneumonia: The presence of consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes seen on CT angiography raises concerns for an infectious process or metastatic deposits to the lungs. The patient is already receiving empiric antibiotic treatment.
4. Metastatic breast cancer spread to the lungs: There is concern for lymphangitic spread of her breast cancer to the lungs.
5. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's condition could be contributing to diastolic dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia. She is experiencing worsening bilateral opacities on CXR, fluid overload, and potential aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse bilateral rales and tachycardia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging studies reveal diffuse ground glass opacities and consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes, which could indicate infection, metastatic deposits, or lymphangitic spread of breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening bilateral opacities on CXR indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes suggests a possible infection, such as aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been initiated, and further diagnostic tests, including sputum culture and influenza swab, are pending.
3. Metastatic Spread to the Lungs: The patient's history of breast cancer and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with history of metastatic breast cancer now admitted with
   prominent hypoxemic respiratory failure.  This was in the setting of
   concern for acute infectious insult which has yet to be fully defined.
   We do have viral culture pending but sample was not able to be
   evaluated for rapid test due to limited numbers of cells.  This leaves
   the insult of likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis in addition to what
   may well be viral pneumonitis.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-This is a provocative
   picture where we do see substantial worsening of the pulmonary
   infiltrates and persistence of the hypoxemia across time.  This would
   lead to a conclusion that ongoing diuresis may be of benefit in regards
   to improvement in oxygenation.  The elevation in the LVEDP is hard to
   postulate with only right sided compromise seen on ECHO unless
   ventricular inter-dependence is at play.
   PNEUMONIA-Will repeat viral culture and DFA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for prominent hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has shown subjective improvement and maintains a negative fluid balance overnight. Vital signs are within normal limits, except for fatigue and tachypnea. The patient is on high-flow oxygen and has crackles in the chest with reduced rhonchi. Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals worsening diffuse alveolar infiltrates on CXR, concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The patient is being treated for respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and breast cancer with medications such as Vancomycin, Azithromycin, Cefepime, and Tamiflu.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure persists despite diuresis. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and potential progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pneumonia - The patient has worsening pulmonary infiltrates and persistent hypoxemia, which may indicate a superimposed infectious process. Monitoring viral culture and DFA results is essential.
3. Pulmonary Edema - The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored to prevent worsening of pulmonary edema. Negative fluid balance should be maintained, and NIV may be necessary if diuresis alone does not improve oxygenation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted for seizures and pneumonia.
- She has been transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by worsening bilateral opacities on her chest X-ray, indicating possible fluid overload.
- A CT angiogram (CTA) was performed, which showed no pulmonary embolism (PE) but revealed diffuse ground glass opacities. There is consolidation in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe, which could represent infection or metastatic deposits to the lungs. There is concern for lymphangitic spread of her breast cancer.
- The patient's respiratory distress may also be caused by pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, and a possible infectious process.
- The patient is currently on empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
- Droplet precautions have been discontinued, and Tamiflu has been given since the influenza DFA was negative.
- Aggressive diuresis has been initiated, and the possibility of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is being considered if the patient's condition worsens.
- Prophylactic PCP treatment and sputum induction are ongoing.
- The patient is currently on a Decadron taper.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9470**], a 50-year-old lady with ER-Her2+ BRCA metastatic to bone, brain, liver, and lung, was admitted for seizures and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by worsening bilateral opacities on CXR, likely fluid overload. A CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse ground glass opacities. There is consolidation in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe, which could represent infection or metastatic deposits to the lungs. There is concern for lymphangitic spread of her breast cancer, possibly contributing to pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, and an infectious process/PNA. The patient's outpatient oncologist believes that lymphangitic spread of her BRCA is the cause.

The patient is receiving empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin (since day 4). Aggressive diuresis is being continued today with 80mg lasix x 1. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is being considered if clinically worsening. Prophylactic PCP treatment and Decadron taper (4mg) are also being continued.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9470**] is a 50 year-old lady w/ ER- Her2+ BRCA metastatic to bone,
   brain, liver and lung admitted for seizures and PNA then x-fer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]
   for respiratory distress in the setting of worsening B/L opacities on
   CXR.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia: CXR with worsening bilateral opacities
   and likely fluid overload.  CTA with no PE but significant for diffuse
   ground glass opacities.  CTA also with consolidation in the right
   middle lobe and right lower lobe which could represent infection or
   metastatic deposits to the lungs.  There is concern for lymphangitic
   spread of her breast cancer. There also could be contribution from
   pulmonary edema [**1-28**] diastolic dysfunction and possible infectious
   process / PNA. This is most likely due to lymphangitic spread of her
   BRCA, acc to outpatient oncologist.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old lady with ER- Her2+ BRCA metastatic to bone, brain, liver, and lung. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia (PNA) and then transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient has worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray and diffuse ground glass opacities seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). This suggests possible pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, infectious process, or lymphangitic spread of her breast cancer. The patient is already on aggressive diuresis and may require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation if clinically worsening.

2. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient is receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin for her breast cancer. She has brain metastasis and radiation-induced necrosis, which likely explains her cerebellar dysfunction. Management is being done per oncology recommendations.

3. Mild Oral and Pharyngeal Dysphagia: The patient has reduced coordination consistent with cerebellar metastasis. Dietary modifications have been made to include nectar thick liquids and soft, moist solids. Aspiration precautions are also in place.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (HCT) level is currently at 28"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old lady with a history of ER-Her2+ BRCA metastatic to bone, brain, liver, and lung. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia, and then transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress due to worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on aggressive diuresis, empiric antibiotic treatment, and prophylactic PCP treatment. She has brain metastasis and radiation-induced necrosis, which explains her cerebellar dysfunction. The patient also has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia due to reduced coordination caused by cerebellar metastasis. She is being managed according to oncology recommendations and is receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 131/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. Her lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid. The patient's family wants to keep her code status as full code for now and is interested in hospice care, either at home or inpatient, but wants to continue with antibiotics and steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. She is being treated for respiratory failure, possible infection, and edema. The unifying diagnosis is still unclear as cultures have been negative to date. The patient is on high-dose steroids and diuretics, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored. Oxygen therapy is being weaned as tolerated. The patient's nutritional intake is limited due to desaturation, and efforts are being made to maintain oral intake. The patient's glycemic control is also being monitored. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer protection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's infection status is unclear due to negative cultures. There is a concern for both influenza and bacterial infection.
3. Edema: The patient has persistent bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting the possibility of edema contributing to her respiratory issues.
4. Pneumonitis: The persistent bilateral patchy infiltrates may also indicate pneumonitis, an inflammation of the lung tissue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 9470], a 50-year-old lady with metastatic breast cancer (Her2+ BRCA), is admitted to the ICU for seizures and pneumonia. She has a history of falls, respiratory distress, hypoxia, and worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on aggressive diuresis and empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. She is also receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin for her metastatic breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may be due to lymphangitic spread of her BRCA, pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, and possible infectious process/PNA. It is important to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support if needed.
2. Fall: The patient fell out of bed and was found on the floor. She was alert and oriented but unable to state how she ended up there. She was returned back to bed, and her neurological exam was non-focal. She was placed in Posey restraints and a STAT CT head and C-spine were ordered. Further assessment and management of the fall should be done, including serial neurological exams and consideration of fall precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 9470] is a 50-year-old lady with ER- Her2+ BRCA metastatic to bone, brain, liver, and lung admitted for seizures and pneumonia. She was initially admitted to the emergency room and then transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has experienced some clinical improvement after aggressive diuresis, with radiographic improvement on chest X-ray compared to several days ago. This improvement is likely due to lymphangitic spread of her BRCA, according to the outpatient oncologist. There may also be contributions from pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, and possible infectious processes/ pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory distress continues, and she remains on empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin (day 5 of a 7-day course). Aggressive diuresis will be continued today with 80mg lasix x 1 if blood pressure tolerates. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be considered if clinically worsening. Prophylactic PCP treatment will also be continued, and all outstanding cultures will be reviewed.

Ms. [Known Last Name 9470] has metastatic breast cancer and is receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin. She has brain metastasis and radiation-induced necrosis, which likely explains her cerebellar dysfunction. Management will follow oncology recommendations"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with history of metastatic breast cancer now with
   admission with severe hypoxemic respiratory compromise. This is in the
   setting of likely lymphangitic spread of cancer but with acute
   process--likely infectious--leading to a diffuse pattern of pulmonary
   edema and likely pneumonitis with some improvement in the setting of
   diuresis.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])--This remains a diagnostic
   challenge.  We have had extensive testing for influenza and in fact
   that plus all other culture data remains negative.  We have had modest
   improvement in oxygenation with diuresis but now with rising creatinine
   and falling blood pressure reasonable limit has been reached.  In this
   setting with persistent and diffuse infiltrates we have added empiric
   treatment for PCP as improvement has clearly plateaued and additional
   therapeutic interventions are quite limited and although sputum samples
   have been negative for PCP in the absence of HIV these samples do have
   limited sensitivity.
   -Decadron at 4mg dose
   -Cefepime/Vanco/Bactrim IV/Azithromycin

   equal pupils and preserved reflexes and motor strength bilaterally
   -CT head and C-Spine this morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxemic respiratory compromise. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and confusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/70 to 85/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has been treated with various medications including IV Bactrim for persistent substantial infiltrates, IV cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient experienced an unwitnessed fall from bed with ecchymosis above the left orbit but did not have any significant deficits or loss of consciousness. A CT scan of the head and cervical spine is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory compromise, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name 9470] is a 50-year-old lady with metastatic breast cancer to the bone, brain, liver, and lung admitted for seizures and pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress due to worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to lymphangitic spread of her cancer, although there has been some improvement over the past few days with diuresis and PCP treatment. She has been receiving empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and cefepime, which will end today. The goal for fluid balance is to achieve an even balance today, and attempts will be made to wean oxygen as tolerated. The patient will continue with PCP treatment using IV Bactrim for a total of five days, ending on [2143-11-27]. Outstanding cultures will be followed up on. The patient is also receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin for her metastatic breast cancer. Palliative care will discuss goals of care with the patient. The patient is on seizure prophylaxis with keppra, and neurological exam is stable with no acute intracranial injury or cervical fracture. She has radiation-induced necrosis in the cerebellum, which explains her cerebellar dysfunction. Posey restraints and fall precautions are in place due to a recent fall. The patient has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with reduced coordination consistent with cerebellar metastasis. She is on a diet of nectar-thick liquids and soft, moist solids, avoiding mixed consistencies. Pills are given whole with apple sauce, and aspiration precautions are in place.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 50-year-old lady with metastatic breast cancer to the bone, brain, liver, and lung.
- She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia, then transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress due to worsening bilateral opacities on CXR.
- She had a fall, but her neurological exam is stable, so no further neurological exams are needed.
- She is currently on diuretics, antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin), and PCP treatment with IV Bactrim.
- Her fluid balance goal is even, and she may require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation if clinically worsening.
- She has metastatic breast cancer and is receiving bevacizumab and Herceptin.
- She has brain metastasis and radiation-induced necrosis, which likely explains her cerebellar dysfunction.
- She has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia due to reduced coordination consistent with cerebellum mets.
- Her diet consists of nectar-thick liquids and soft, moist solids. She should avoid mixed consistencies containing liquids and solids.
- She is on a prophylactic regimen for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
- Her code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is likely to an LTAC facility.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.

   24 Hour Events:
   -Family meeting with extensive discussion--currently we expect a
   persistence of respiratory compromise and hypoxemia given absence of
   further trend to improvement.  Will maintain patient as DNR/DNI in
   concert with their wishes.  Will continue with full treatment course at

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer and significant involvement in the brain, bone, and lung. She is currently experiencing persistent respiratory compromise with ongoing treatment. The cause of her respiratory failure is attributed to non-cardiogenic edema, possible initial infectious insult, and some contribution from lymphangitic carcinomatosis. The patient has shown a small amount of improvement in pulmonary infiltrates but continues to have significant hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory compromise and hypoxemia indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. The non-cardiogenic edema, initial infectious insult, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis contribute to this condition.
2. Infection: Despite completing the course of cefepime and vancomycin, there is no identified pathogen causing the initial infectious insult. Therefore, there is a possibility of ongoing infection that may complicate the patient's condition.
3. CNS Involvement: The patient is receiving dexmedetomidine (Dex) for CNS involvement. This suggests that there might be neurological complications associated with her metastatic breast cancer affecting the central nervous system.
4. Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient's creatinine rise and current orthostasis indicate a potential complication of orthostatic hypotension. This could be due to fluid shifts or renal dysfunction.
5. Disposition: The patient's clinical course has been static, but with some improvement"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9470**] is a 50 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 503**], liver and lung admitted for seizures and PNA then
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory distress in the setting of
   worsening B/L opacities on CXR.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: Some mild clinical improvement after
   aggressive diuresis but overall patient is not able to be weaned fro
   her oxygen requirement.  Her distress is likely combination of
   lymphangitis spread of her breast cancer, fluid overload that is not
   being adequately mobilized from her lungs for diuresis, and possible
   infection.
   - Antibiotic 8-day course with vancomycin, cefepime ended [**11-25**]
   - No lung biopsy given respiratory distress and patient wishes.
   - Fluid balance goal of even today, requiring 80mg IV Lasix to keep her
   even every day
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated
   - Continue PCP treatment with IV Bactrim for total 5 day course to end
   [**2143-11-27**] (currently on day 4)
   - F/u all outstanding cultures
   - Continue Decadron 4mg [**Hospital1 **]

   #. Metastatic Breast Cancer: She was getting bevacizumab and Herceptin.
   She has brain metastasis and radiation induced necrosis which likely
   explains her cerebellar dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain, liver, and lung. She was admitted for seizures and pneumonia, and then transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, unable to be weaned off oxygen. She has a history of cerebellar dysfunction, likely due to radiation-induced necrosis from brain metastasis. She has also experienced a fall but her neurological exam remains stable. The patient has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with reduced coordination consistent with cerebellar metastasis. She is on a diet of nectar-thick liquids and soft, moist solids. Her hemoglobin concentration is low at 9.4 g/dL, indicating anemia. She has been receiving aggressive diuretics, antibiotics, and PCP treatment. The patient's family has been informed about her prognosis and the possibility of transferring her to a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) with hospice in the next few days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient is experiencing ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia, which is likely due to a combination of lymphangitis spread of her breast cancer, fluid overload, and possible infection. Weaning off oxygen may be challenging due to these factors.
2. Infection: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now admitted wtih hypoxemic
   respiratory compromise who has persistent and significant hypoxemia
   despite maximal medical therapy.  We have continued to treat all
   categories of insult.  This has resulted in a very clear plateau at
   this time with persistent hypoxemia and inability to maintain capacity
   to oxygenate with even the most minimal effort such as turning in bed.
   Respiratory Failure/Hypoxemia-
   -Bactrim in place at 3 days of trial and we simply have no change in
   status
will continue to 5 days to evaluate for any improvement and
   consider D/C if no change seen
   -Continue to maintain even fluid balance to negative if possible
   -O2 as needed
   Metastatic Breast Cancer-
   -Neurontin
   -Decadon

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory compromise. Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient continues to have persistent and significant hypoxemia with an inability to maintain oxygenation even with minimal effort. The patient's respiratory failure/hypoxemia is being managed with Bactrim for five days to evaluate for any improvement and consider discontinuation if no change is seen. Fluid balance is being maintained, and oxygen supplementation is ongoing.

The patient has metastatic breast cancer and is on medications such as Neurontin, Decadon, and Keppra. No further treatment options are available per Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 3650].

In terms of ICU care, nutrition is being provided orally as possible, glycemic control is being monitored, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer protection are in place.

The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) and is on prophylactic heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is ICU."

   - Will explore with care management hospice at home vs inpatient
   hospice here
   - F/u all outstanding cultures
   - Continue Decadron 4mg IV BID
   - Will d/c PPI/venlafaxine
   #. Metastatic Breast Cancer: She was getting bevacizumab and Herceptin.
   She has brain metastasis and radiation induced necrosis which likely
   explains her cerebellar dysfunction.
   - Appreciate palliative care recs
   - Continue seizure ppx w/ keppra
   - Future care planning as above
   #. S/p Fall: Neurological exam continues to be stable, Head CT and C
   spine wnl.
   - Continue Posey restraints and fall precautions
   #. Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia: Has reduced coordination c/w
   cerebellar mets.
   - Diet of nectar thick liquids and soft, moist solids. Avoid mixed
   consistencies that contain liquids and solids.
   - Pills whole with apple sauce
   - Food given for comfort only
   - Aspiration precautions
   # Anemia: HCT currently 28.6 and stable.
   - Continue to trend, but can likely change to every other day lab draws

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and worsening bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on comfort measures only, receiving morphine and lorazepam as needed. The patient has mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia and is being given food for comfort only. The patient's family is present at the bedside.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation (SpO2 at 70%) indicate a potential risk for further deterioration in respiratory function. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's air hunger and comfort will be necessary.
2. Metastatic breast cancer: The underlying metastatic breast cancer may continue to progress and cause additional symptoms or complications. Palliative care recommendations should be followed to provide comfort and manage symptoms.
3. Oral and pharyngeal dysphagia: The patient's mild dysphagia may worsen, leading to difficulty in swallowing and potential aspiration. Providing food for comfort only and ensuring proper positioning during feeding will be important to minimize the risk of aspiration.
4. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating (between 96-165 mg/dL), indicating a need for close monitoring and management of the patient's glycemic control.
5. Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of -193"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) due to persistent hypoxemia and poor mental status. The patient's family is struggling to accept the prolonged process of the patient's passing and is expressing exhaustion and frustration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not adequately managed. Oxygen support is already in place, and additional measures such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation may be considered based on the patient's clinical condition.

2. Comfort Measures: Given the patient's CMO status, the focus will be on providing comfort and palliative care. Morphine sulfate infusion is being used to maintain patient comfort, and social work support and palliative care services are available to address the emotional needs of the patient and their family.

3. Infection Risk: The patient has a central line (indwelling Port) in place, which increases the risk of infection. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent or minimize the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and malignancy increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of clot formation.

5. Stress Ulcer"
