","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presented with altered mental status but is now showing improvement. Her abdominal pain has also improved. The patient has been receiving insulin via a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 units per hour, and her blood glucose levels are being closely monitored. Frequent electrolyte checks are also being conducted. The patient's head CT scan came back normal. She is on dialysis for her ESRD and receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of DKA: Despite the improvement in the patient's gap, there is still a risk of worsening DKA due to her renal failure. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and electrolytes is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Hypoglycemia: With the ongoing insulin infusion, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the patient's insulin sensitivity changes or if there are errors in dosing.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's renal function may lead to difficulty in managing potassium levels, increasing the risk of hyperkalemia.
4. Fluid overload:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm [**4-18**]
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomiting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.
   Alk phos elevated, but other LFTs normal. Exam benign.  KUB
   unrevealing.  Overnight, Pt appears to be trying to wretch and crying
   out asking for pain medication. Once given, Pt falls asleep
   immediately.  She is very sleepy on exam, cooperates, but falls asleep
   during exam.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] have component of somatization/secondary gain, may also be
   component of narcotic withdrawal
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen if concern for acute intraabdominal
   process, although low likelihood based on normal exam
   - Hold pain meds for sedation
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed HD since for one week. No urgent need for HD
   overnight. Fistula with palpable thrill in RUE.
   - Pt dialyzed yesterday
   - Will continue to follow renal recs
   - Dialysis scheduled MWF
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt persistently hypertensive/tachycardic
   - On home regimen of clonidine patch, labetolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
   5 mg qD
   - Can give 10 mg IV hydralazine PRN for hypertension if Pt markedly
   hypertensive or otherwise symptomatic
   .
   # Social: Pt w/ longstanding hx of medication non-compliance. Also w/
   stressful social situation at baseline
   - SW consult in AM
   ,
   # FEN: Regular Diet today
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   # Access: Femoral triple lumen [**2101-4-18**] 12:34 AM
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  presumed full
   # Disposition: call out to floor today
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She presents with abdominal pain and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's anion gap has now closed, and her blood sugars have improved from the 300s to the 70s after starting IV insulin without bolus in the emergency department.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ damage if not treated promptly.
2. Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying without any mechanical obstruction. It can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
3. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Non-compliance with Medications: The patient has a history of medication non-compliance, which can lead to worsening of her medical conditions and increase the risk of complications.
5. Stressful Social Situation: The patient is also facing a stressful social situation, which may contribute to her overall health and well-being.

It is important to monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s. Would ideally like
   to start SQ insulin, but will need to confirm SQ dose in AM.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm yesterday
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomitting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.
   Alk phos elevated, but other LFTs normal. Exam benign.  Overnight, Pt
   appears to be trying to wretch and crying out asking for pain
   medication. Once given, Pt falls asleep immediately.
   - Suspect component of somatization/secondary gain
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen if concern for acute intraabdominal
   process
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed HD since Monday. No urgent need for HD overnight.
   Fistula with palpable thrill in RUE.
   - Pt dialyzed yesterday
   - Will continue to follow renal recs
   - Dialysis scheduled MWF
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt persistently hypertensive/tachycardic
   - On home regimen of clonidine patch, labetolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
   5 mg qD
   - Can give 10 mg IV hydralazine PRN for hypertension if Pt markedly
   hypertensive or otherwise symptomatic
   .
   # Social: Pt w/ longstanding hx of medication non-compliance. Also w/
   stressful social situation at baseline
   - SW consult in AM

","The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with abdominal pain and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been non-compliant with her insulin regimen and experienced gastroparesis. DKA was managed with IV insulin, which improved her blood sugar levels from the 300s to the 70s. The patient continues to experience intermittent tolerance of oral intake, nausea, and abdominal pain, possibly due to gastroparesis. She responded well to pain medication. Anion gap has now closed. The patient's hypertension is being managed with her home regimen of clonidine patch, labetalol, and lisinopril. The patient missed hemodialysis since Monday but did not require urgent HD overnight. The patient's fistula is present with a palpable thrill in the right upper extremity. Dialysis was performed yesterday, and the patient will continue to follow renal recommendations. Dialysis is scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Social work consult is planned in the morning due to the patient's longstanding history of medication non-compliance and stressful social situation. The patient is currently on a clear diet, advancing as tolerated. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient has peripheral and femoral triple lumen access. The patient's code status is presumed full"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. She has a history of hypertension and allergies to certain medications. She has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antihypertensive drugs, pain relief, and antiemetics. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hypertensive despite holding her home blood pressure medications due to persistent nausea. Her labs show elevated creatinine, glucose levels, and liver enzymes. There is no obvious small bowel obstruction on the KUB obtained. The patient continues to complain of abdominal pain but responds well to pain relief medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may be a result of the patient's underlying condition or the medications she is receiving.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating possible poorly controlled blood sugar levels. This can increase the risk of further complications such as infections or delayed wound healing.

3. Hypertensive emergency/urgency: Despite holding her home antihypertensive medications, the patient remains hypertensive. This needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications related to high blood pressure, such as heart attack, stroke, or organ damage.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's persistent abdominal pain and nausea suggest ongoing gastrointestinal distress. This can lead"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She presented with abdominal pain and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's DKA was likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastroparesis. She has no clear precipitating event other than noncompliance. There are no signs of infection, normal lipase levels, negative serum toxicology, and an unremarkable neurologic examination, making a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) unlikely. The diagnosis of DKA is supported by an anion gap of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia. The patient was started on intravenous insulin without a bolus in the emergency department, and her blood sugar levels improved from the 300s to the 70s. However, the patient continues to complain of gastrointestinal pain and nausea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient's history of DM1 and ESRD puts her at risk for DKA. DKA can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential organ damage if not promptly treated.

2. Gastroparesis - Gastroparesis is a known complication of diabetes and can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It may be the et"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) admitted to the MICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's DKA has resolved, and she is currently on subcutaneous insulin Lantus with a sliding scale. Her mental status is somnolent but arousable and following commands.

The patient is experiencing intermittent abdominal pain, which may be related to withdrawal or another cause. Her ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - due to ESRD and ongoing hemodialysis.
2. Hypoglycemia - from insulin therapy for DKA.
3. Infection - due to immunocompromised state and use of indwelling lines.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - from immobility and ESRD.
5. Stress ulcer - from critical illness and medications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - from prolonged intubation.
7. Medication errors - from complex medication regimen.
8. Fluid overload - from hemodialysis and fluid administration.
9. Hyperkalemia - from ESRD and medications.
10. Acid-base imbalance - from DKA and renal failure.
