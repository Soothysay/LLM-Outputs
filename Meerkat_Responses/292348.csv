   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -         iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -         follow hct daily.
   -         Maintain Type and screen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old obese woman with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was transferred to the hospital for an evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, pulmonary embolism (PE), ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, leg wounds, anemia, and anxiety. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 141/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's EKG shows atrial fibrillation with no acute ischemia.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's INR is supra-therapeutic, and she has been holding on further bronchodilators as there is no wheezing.

The patient's plan includes pursuing bronchoscopy to further"

- She has a history of hypertension and is on metoprolol.
- She also has leg wounds that require wound care.
- The patient has anemia, which may be due to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy.
- She has anxiety and is on zoloft and ativan.
- The patient is on tube feeds and is NPO after midnight.
- She has a central line that needs to be removed and replaced with a PICC line.
- She is on contact precautions and is dispositioned to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of tracheobronchomalacia and morbid obesity puts her at risk for respiratory failure. This could be exacerbated by her large goiter, which may worsen breathing, especially while supine.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever with unknown origin. Possible causes include pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, or pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation is needed, including CXR, sputum gram stain and culture, blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes
   - ASA 325 daily
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR therapeutic currently, continue warfarin
   - Will review CT chest with radiology here
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN
   Continue metoprolol
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   Will consult wound care for local care recommendations
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate, guiac stools and follow hct
   daily. Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old obese woman with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the ICU for an evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, cellulitis, renal failure, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, AFib, large goiter, or a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of rhonchi bilaterally in the lungs suggests possible pneumonia (PNA), while increased shortness of breath (SOB) in the hospital may indicate a PE. The patient's limited pulmonary reserve due to morbid obesity and large goiter worsens her breathing, especially when supine. Poor rate control of AFib is another important consideration.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which could be caused by recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) colitis, especially given her recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use. PNA is another consideration, and the patient's fever could also be mild due to a PE.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds

   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for an intensive care unit (ICU) evaluation.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory difficulties may be due to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory infection/bronchitis prior to transfer.
2. Fever: The patient is currently afebrile, but there have been mildly elevated temperatures overnight. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test is negative, and antibiotics have been held. Cultures will be followed, and antibiotics will be discontinued if the patient remains afebrile.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): An attending physician's review of a chest CT from OSH will be evaluated for PE. The patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic for PICC line placement, so it will be held today. If PE is present, the patient will need to start on a heparin drip.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the ICU for an evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, which puts her at risk for recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis. Other potential complications include pulmonary embolism (PE), fever of unknown origin (FUO), and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to morbid obesity, OSA, and tracheobronchomalacia. If not managed appropriately, she may continue to experience respiratory difficulties.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to pneumonia or recurrent C. difficile colitis. Appropriate cultures and diagnostic tests are pending.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has risk factors for PE, including significant right ventricular dysfunction, limited mobility, and subtherapeutic anticoagulation. A CT chest did not show any PE, but further evaluation may be necessary.
4. ESRD on HD"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely mulHistory suggestive of a
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, which may contribute to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited due to morbid obesity, and a large goiter may worsen breathing, especially while supine.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has significant right ventricular dysfunction, which may be secondary to OSA. She is at significant risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE due to limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
3. Clostridium difficile Colitis: Given loose stools and recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use, the patient is at significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pneumonia is another consideration.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rate is poorly controlled on metoprolol,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD and
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending

   -          follow hct daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status has been unstable, with intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia.

The patient's fever is likely due to an infection, such as pneumonia or C. difficile colitis. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation. The patient's atrial fibrillation rate is poorly controlled, and her hypertension needs to be managed. She has leg wounds that require wound care. The patient is anemic, possibly due to renal insufficiency and iron deficiency. Anxiety has been noted, and she may benefit from restarting her home medications, including zoloft and ativan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may experience further deterioration in lung function due to her underlying conditions such as OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, URI/bronchitis, tracheobronchomalacia, and poor rate"

   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute
   phase reactant.  Of note B12 also high
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to multiple factors such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure, volume overload from end-stage renal disease, goiter, and previous upper respiratory infection/bronchitis. There is a possibility of pulmonary embolism, but the radiology report suggests only a small right lower segment PE. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and Coumadin has been restarted. The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and metoprolol has been increased. The patient has leg wounds, anemia, anxiety, and fever of unknown origin. She is scheduled for hemodialysis today and plans to be extubated afterward. A bronchoscopy has been discussed but may not be pursued. Potential complications that can arise include respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, chronic fever of unknown origin, cellulitis, and end-stage renal disease. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. There is a 50% chance of a small right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE) based on radiology reports, but it is not confirmed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/59 to 126/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels, along with low platelet count. The patient's kidney function is impaired.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The radiology reports suggest a possible small right lower lobe PE, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to respiratory distress and cardiac complications.
2. Cellulitis: The presence of cellulitis increases the risk of infection spreading and potentially developing into a more severe condition such as sepsis.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for further skin breakdown and potential infections.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of suspected tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to morbid obesity and other underlying conditions such as chronic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea. Tracheobronchomalacia may also contribute to difficulties in tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary embolism: There is a possibility of a pulmonary embolism based on the radiology report indicating a 50% chance of a small right lower segment PE. However, the quality of the study was poor. If confirmed, anticoagulation therapy with heparin will be required.
3. Fever: The patient had mild elevations in temperature overnight, which could indicate an infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been held pending further results.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently poorly controlled, and the dosage of metoprolol needs to be increased.
5. Hypertension: The patient had transient hypertension on admission, and blood pressure control is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute
   phase reactant.  Of note B12 also high
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.

   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the ICU for interventional procedures (IP) evaluation due to respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fever of unknown origin (FUO), impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic respiratory failure, cellulitis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory infection/bronchitis. These factors may contribute to her respiratory difficulties.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): There is a possibility of PE due to the patient's risk factors such as immobility and ESRD. However, her INR is currently subtherapeutic, and she is on Coumadin for AFib, so the likelihood of a small PE that does not require anticoagulation is mentioned.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient requires hemodialysis three times a week. It is important to monitor her renal function and adjust the"

The patient, a 64-year-old obese woman with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), was transferred to the hospital for an interventional procedure evaluation. The patient has been in respiratory failure likely due to a combination of factors such as OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory infection/bronchitis prior to transfer. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and awake, able to write answers on a whiteboard, and has no gross focal deficits. 

Physical examination reveals an obese woman lying in bed, appearing somewhat uncomfortable but in no acute distress. Her sclera is white, and conjunctiva is pink. She has a well-healed tracheostomy scar at the base of her neck and a palpable goiter. Lung examination shows rhonchi bilaterally without wheezing. The patient has irregular tachycardia with no murmurs appreciated. There is warmth, edema, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - Formal bronchoscopy tomorrow in suite by IP to determine if
   subglottic stenosis is present and to determine degree of external
   compression by goiter .
   - Follow cultures, hold abx as no sign of infection currently.
   - Volume removal with HD today
   - Very small chance she has a PE after discussion with attending
   radiologist, continue coumadin for A fib
   - Holding albuterol given tachycardia, restarting ipratropium
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today for more volume removal
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol,
   increased to 75 TID with better control.
   - Restarted coumadin
   - Follow daily INR, currently 1.4 but does not require heparin bridge
   .
   #. HTN:  Better controlled now.
   -Continue metoprolol only at increased dose
   .
   #. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.
   - guiac stools and
   - follow hct daily.
   - Maintain type and screen.
   .
   #. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .

She was admitted to the ICU for an interventional procedure (IP) evaluation due to suspected tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 50%. The patient is extubated and previously received invasive ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals an obese woman in bed, with well-healed tracheostomy scar at the base of the neck, distant breath sounds without wheezing or crackles, irregular tachycardia, and no murmurs. There is also evidence of bilateral lower extremity edema, well-healing wounds on the medial upper thighs, and a red rash on the right arm where the blood pressure cuff had been located.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and potassium levels, as well as decreased platelet count (Plt"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  The patient
   will go to the OR tomorrow for correction of the stenosis.
   - FFP and desmopressin to the OR tomorrow.
   - Hold coumadin tonight, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD, due [**Hospital1 511**].
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - dexamethasone for inflammation
   - Heli-Ox for stridor overnight
   - If requires intubation, will need very small tube.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, due [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require UF tomorrow
   after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Hold coumadin given to OR tomorrow
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the hospital for an interventional procedure (IP) evaluation due to frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely multifactorial secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory infection/bronchitis prior to transfer. A bronchoscopy today showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. The patient will undergo correction of the stenosis in the operating room tomorrow.

Other medical issues include ESRD on hemodialysis, poorly controlled AFib, hypertension controlled with metoprolol, leg wounds, anemia most likely secondary to ESRD, and anxiety. The patient is also on a renal diet and has impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the tracheal stenosis is not corrected, further deterioration of renal function, increased risk of thromboembolic events due to immobility, and potential infections due to compromised skin integrity."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5278] is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (afib), multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the hospital for an intensive care unit (ICU) evaluation due to frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. Upon arrival, she required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and had an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing hypercarbia. She also had a rash from a blood pressure cuff and warm, bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. She will undergo surgery tomorrow to correct the stenosis. She is currently on CPAP and has been started on diltiazem for rate control in afib. Her hypertension is controlled with metoprolol. She has impaired skin integrity, anxiety, anemia likely secondary to ESRD, and chronic respiratory failure. Other issues include fever of unknown origin, cellulitis, and leg wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the ICU with bronchospasm due to bronchial stenosis. The patient has undergone hemodialysis and has shown improvement in renal function. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a heart rate ranging from 109-125 bpm. Oxygen saturation remains at 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery. The physical examination reveals atrial fibrillation and peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient's neurological status is not assessed. 

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is elevated, while creatinine level is slightly increased. Troponin T levels are within normal range. The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging shows no significant changes. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and supportive care. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being addressed. The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in case of cardiac arrest. Disposition is not specified in the note.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  Successful
   recannalization in OR yesterday.
   - Held coumadin, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD prn
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - CPAP overnight as needed
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, will have today, may require UF
   tomorrow after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol, however as patient responded so well to
   diltiazem yesterday, may consider switching to PO diltiazem via a dilt
   drip if goes into RVR again.
   - Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.
   .

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5278] is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (afib), multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to [Hospital1 19] for an intensive care unit (ICU) evaluation of frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. 

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. Successful recanalization was performed in the operating room yesterday.

She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely multifactorial secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory infection/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.

Other medical issues include ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, leg wounds, anemia, and anxiety. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate due to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and previous URI/bronchitis.
2. Infection: The patient has contact precautions for suspected MRSA"
