   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 4
   with fever, mental status change, and tachycardia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient febrile and tachycardic with leukocytosis this
   afternoon in setting of recent surgery suggestive of SIRS/sepsis.  Most
   likely source at this time is post-operative abdominal wound
   infection.  She has had a CT abdomen and pelvis and CTH that, per wet
   read, were negative for new source of infection.  She also has a UA
   that were negative, UTI less likely.  She also had a RIJ placed
   yesterday morning, making line associated infection unlikely.  CXR this
   morning read as LLL infiltrate, although this appears more likely to be
   retrocardiac effusion with associated atelectasis.  WBC this AM
   trending down to 25.2.
   - Broad antibiotic therapy with cipro, flagyl, vancomycin for adequate
   surgical and abdominal infectious processes.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up radiology studies.
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC, lactate
   - Per neuro, would like LP to rule out meningitis today.
   - C. diff and stoolx3
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to infectious
   process/sepsis.  Unclear at this time if patient had a true seizure as
   opposed to delirium.  Infection as well as her antibiotics
   (ciprofloxacin) may lower her seizure threshold.  Patient was evaluated
   by neurology, which recommended loading with dilantin, imaging, and
   LP.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per neuro, EEG, LP, and consider MRI.
   - Continue dilantin and primidone.
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 4 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM of 24.1 down from 26.1 yesterday and 32.8 on
   admission. Patient at baseline has low MCV likely from iron defiency
   anemia. Acute hematocrit drop likely secondary to post-operative
   bleeding versus hemolysis.
   - Hemolysis labs
   - Trend hematocrit Q12H
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or earlier if signs of end organ damage.
   .
   # Right hand swelling: Patient with new RUE swelling today of hand with
   associated warmth concerning for DVT versus cellulitis.
   - RUE ultrasound to r/o DVT.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   - Will consider MR, especially if CTH final read is concerning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, mental status changes, and tachycardia. 

The patient underwent ventral hernia repair on POD 4 and is now presenting with signs of infection, including leukocytosis and fever. The CT abdomen and pelvis, as well as CTH, did not reveal any new sources of infection. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that is less likely. 

The patient has been started on broad antibiotic therapy, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin, to cover for surgical and abdominal infectious processes. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered for follow-up. 

The patient's altered mental status is suspected to be secondary to the infectious process or sepsis. Neurology recommends evaluating for meningitis through a lumbar puncture (LP) and conducting an EEG, MRI, and possibly loading with dilantin. 

The patient's recent surgery may have complicated with an infection, leading to the current symptoms. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia with a hematocrit drop from 32.8 on admission to 24.1 this morning. This acute drop could be due to post-operative bleeding or hemolysis. 

The patient is also experiencing right upper extremity (RUE) swelling with warmth, which is concerning for"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 4
   with fever, mental status change, and tachycardia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient febrile and tachycardic with leukocytosis this
   afternoon in setting of recent surgery suggestive of SIRS/sepsis.  Most
   likely source at this time is post-operative abdominal wound
   infection.  She has had a CT abdomen and pelvis and CTH that, per wet
   read, were negative for new source of infection.  She also has an
   unremarkable CXR and UA that were negative, making pneumonia or UTI
   less likely.  She also had a RIJ placed yesterday morning, making line
   associated infection unlikely.  WBC this AM trending down to 25.2.
   - Broad antibiotic therapy with cipro, flagyl, vancomycin for adequate
   surgical and abdominal infectious processes.
   - IVF bolus for CVP>8 and MAP>65.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up radiology studies.
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC, lactate
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to infectious
   process/sepsis.  Unclear at this time if patient had a true seizure as
   opposed to delirium.  Infection as well as her antibiotics may lower
   her seizure threshold.  Patient was evaluated by neurology, which
   recommended loading with dilantin, imaging, and possible LP.  At this
   time, will defer LP as surgical wound infection much more likely source
   for infection as opposed to meningitis.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per neuro, EEG tomorrow, consider MRI tomorrow.
   - Continue dilantin and primidone.
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 4 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM of 24.1 down from 26.1 yesterday and 32.8 on
   admission. Patient at baseline has low MCV likely from iron defiency
   anemia. Acute hematocrit drop likely secondary to post-operative
   bleeding.
   - Trend hematocrit Q12H
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or earlier if signs of end organ damage.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   - Will consider MRI tomorrow, especially if CTH final read is
   concerning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, now on day 4 post-operative from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, and tachycardia. The patient's recent surgery suggests possible SIRS/sepsis, likely due to a post-operative abdominal wound infection. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed no new source of infection, making pneumonia or UTI less likely. The patient has been started on broad antibiotic therapy, IV fluid bolus for CVP>8 and MAP>65, follow-up blood and urine cultures, and monitoring of fever curve, WBC, and lactate.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is febrile and tachycardic with leukocytosis, suggesting SIRS/sepsis. The most likely source is a post-operative abdominal wound infection. Broad antibiotic therapy has been initiated to cover surgical and abdominal infectious processes. IV fluid bolus will be given for CVP>8 and MAP>65. Follow-up blood and urine cultures will be done, along with monitoring of fever curve, WBC, and lactate.
2. Altered mental status: This is most likely secondary to the infectious process/sepsis. The patient's seizure disorder may have been exacerbated by the infection and antibiotics. Neurology recommended loading with dilantin, imaging, and possible LP. However, LP will be deferred as the surgical wound infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. She has a fever and is suspected to have a post-operative infection. Her vital signs show tachycardia, mild hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's physical examination reveals that she is ill-appearing, lethargic, and has limited chest examination due to vocalizations. Her abdomen is non-distended, and there are no signs of edema or pneumoboots. Neurological examination shows that she is awake and oriented to her name but not following commands. 

Lab results indicate leukocytosis, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT and INR). The chest X-ray is generally clear with low lung volumes. The assessment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, performing a lumbar puncture, awaiting culture results, reviewing abdominal CT, and sending a sample for C. difficile if stool is present. Neurological input is appreciated, and an EEG will be obtained today. An MRI is pending other studies, and the patient requires pain management with dilaudid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which suggests an underlying infection. The source of infection is unclear, but it is suspected to be a post-operative infection. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of septic shock.
2. Seizure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 4
   with fever, mental status change, and tachycardia.
   .
   # Altered mental status/fever/tachycardia: Concerning on transfer for
   sepsis picture given meeting SIRS critieria.  She has been normotensive
   to hypertensive overnight, likely with elevated SBP secondary to pain.
   Also discovered yesterday that patient has bipolar disorder and is on
   valium, ativan, wellbutrin, seroquel, and remeron on at home.  Current
   mental status change, low grade fever, tachycardia likely has component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawl given significant home dose of benzos that
   patient has not received while hospitalized.  We have been unable to
   find a source to her infection with negative LP, UA, and CTAP as well
   as cultures NGTD.  CXR is also underwhelming with regard to LLL
   infiltrate versus effusion.  Patient also had an EEG performed today.
   - Continue vanco, levo, flagyl  per surgery recs
   - Add ativan 0.5 tid with serial mental status assessments
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data and C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**].
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC
   - Follow-up EEG results
   - Follow-up with neuro regarding dilantin level
   - Continue primidone and dilantin
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 5 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM of 21.8 today from 24.1 yesterday morning and
   32.8 on admission. Hemolysis labs yesterday negative.  Likely
   represents post-operative bleed.  Also has baseline anemia, likely
   anemia of chronic inflammation given Fe/TIBC <20%.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck PM hct.
   - Transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Will restart ativan as
   above.
   - Consult CL psych regarding adding psychotropic meds.
   .
   # Right hand swelling: Patient with persistent RUE swelling today of
   hand with associated warmth concerning for DVT versus cellulitis.
   - RUE ultrasound to asssess for DVT.

   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   - Will consider MR, especially if CTH final read is concerning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, now on day 5 post-ventral hernia repair, who presents with fever, altered mental status, and tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fever, lethargy, and moaning, responding to noxious stimuli but able to follow commands and answer questions. Vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate in the 130s, blood pressure in the 170s, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has rhonchi bilaterally on lung examination and a large vertical incision with dressing C/D/I, two JP drains with serosanguinous drainage. There is no evidence of involuntary guarding. The patient's right upper extremity hand is swollen with warmth, concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or cellulitis. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.6, elevated glucose levels, and slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. Imaging shows an increase in the left basal opacity, concerning for developing pneumonia, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.

   stable if not hypertensive, likely secondary to pain.  Leukocytosis
   persists.  Most likely infectious etiology at this time is
   post-operative surgical wound infection versus LLL pneumonia. CXR
   continues to demonstrate retrocardiac opacity concerning for infiltrate
   versus left-sided effusion.  LP yesterday negative.
   - Continue broed empiric coverage with vanco, cipro, and flagyl.
   - Follow-up blood, urine, CSF cultures
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC, lactate

   (ciprofloxacin) may lower her seizure threshold.   Continued mental
   status change likely multifactorial including infection, inadequate
   pain control, and discontinuation of home psychotropic meds.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder who underwent ventral hernia repair, LOA, and fascial release. She is currently in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications. The main concerns include sepsis, altered mental status, anemia, right hand swelling, and potential thyroid issues.

Sepsis: The patient has a fever of 101.8, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. The most likely sources of infection are post-operative surgical wound infection or left lower lobe pneumonia. Empiric coverage with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole is being continued while awaiting culture results.

Altered mental status: The patient is lethargic, moaning, and unresponsive to commands or questions. This could be secondary to the infectious process or sepsis. It is also possible that her mental status change is related to inadequate pain control or discontinuation of home psychotropic medications. An EEG has been ordered, and dilantin has been started for seizure prophylaxis.

Ventral hernia repair: The patient had surgery five days ago, which was complicated by infection. Antibiotics have been initiated as above, and follow-up with general and plastic surgery is recommended.

Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 24.1% yesterday to 21.8% today. This may represent a post-operative bleed or ongoing hemol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 4
   with fever, mental status change, and tachycardia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Tmax overnight of 101.8.  Continues to be hemodynamically
   stable if not hypertensive, likely secondary to pain.  Leukocytosis
   persists.  Most likely infectious etiology at this time is
   post-operative surgical wound infection versus LLL pneumonia. CXR
   continues to demonstrate retrocardiac opacity concerning for infiltrate
   versus left-sided effusion.  LP yesterday negative.
   - Continue broed empiric coverage with vanco, cipro, and flagyl.
   - Follow-up blood, urine, CSF cultures
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC, lactate
   - C. diff and stoolx3
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to infectious
   process/sepsis.  Unclear at this time if patient had a true seizure as
   opposed to delirium.  Infection as well as her antibiotics
   (ciprofloxacin) may lower her seizure threshold.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - EEG today
   - Continue dilantin and primidone.
   - Follow-up with neuro regarding dilantin level.
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 5 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM of 21.8 today from 24.1 yesterday morning and
   32.8 on admission. Hemolysis labs yesterday negative.  Likely
   represents post-operative bleed.  Also has baseline anemia, likely
   anemia of chronic inflammation given Fe/TIBC <20%.
   - Recheck hemolysis labs and smear for schistocytes
   - Hct check Q6H
   - Transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # Right hand swelling: Patient with persistent RUE swelling today of
   hand with associated warmth concerning for DVT versus cellulitis.
   - RUE ultrasound to asssess for DVT.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   - Will consider MR, especially if CTH final read is concerning.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, currently on day 4 post-operative from ventral hernia repair, left orbital amputation, and fascial release. She presents with fever, mental status changes, and tachycardia. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/83 mmHg to 170/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.6 K/uL, and her hemoglobin level has decreased from 24.1% yesterday morning to 21.8% today. The platelet count is within normal range.

She has an increased lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows increased opacities in the left basal region of the lungs, which may indicate pneumonia or atelectasis. A small bilateral pleural effusion is also present.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she has a history of seizure disorder. It is unclear if her recent symptoms are due to a true seizure or delirium. 

She has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, recurrent spontaneous abortions, and a family history of thrombophilia.

   sepsis picture given fullfilment of SIRS critieria.  Continues to be
   hemodynamically stable with normal MAP.  Continues to be febrile
   overnight to 102. Patient evaluated by pscyh, who do not feel that this
   is the case. No infectious source identified to date with blood, urine,
   CSF cultures negative.  At this time, symptoms including AMS continue
   to be either due to infectious process likely post-op infection versus
   benzo withdrawal.  EEG demonstrated encephelopathy.
   - Continue broad empiric coverage with vanco, levo, flagyl
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data.

On examination, her vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.8 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal impairment. 

The patient's mental status changes and fever are concerning for sepsis, especially with the fulfillment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria. However, no infectious source has been identified yet. The patient's EEG demonstrates encephalopathy. 

The patient's blood cultures are negative, and she has received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. 

Other assessments and plans include anemia, psychotropic medication management, right hand swelling (negative for deep vein thrombosis), thyroid function, recurrent spontaneous abortions, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), prophylactic measures, and access. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 6
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change, and
   tachycardia.
   .
   # Altered mental status/fever/tachycardia: Concerning on transfer for
   sepsis picture given fullfilment of SIRS critieria.  Continues to be
   hemodynamically stable with normal MAP.  Continues to be febrile
   overnight to 102. Patient evaluated by pscyh, who do not feel that this
   is the case. No infectious source identified to date with blood, urine,
   CSF cultures negative.  At this time, symptoms including AMS continue
   to be either due to infectious process likely post-op infection versus
   benzo withdrawal.  EEG demonstrated encephelopathy.
   - Continue broad empiric coverage with vanco, levo, flagyl
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data.
   - Monitor fever curve, WBC
   - Continue primidone and dilantin
   - Follow-up with neuro and psych recs
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 6 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient transfused 1u PRBC yesterday.  Hct this AM of 22 from
   23.5 post-transfusion hct yesterday. Likely represents post-op bleed in
   setting of baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, psychotropic
   continue to be held
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   .
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   - Will consider MR, especially if CTH final read is concerning.
   .
   # FEN: TPN restarted yesterday. Replete as necessary. Recheck serum
   chemistries this afternoon.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Access: RIJ
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU level of care.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, currently in the ICU post-ventral hernia repair. She presents with altered mental status, fever, and tachycardia. The patient has been evaluated by the psychiatric team, who do not believe that this is a case of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Infectious source has not been identified in blood, urine, and CSF cultures. EEG demonstrated encephalopathy.

The patient's vitals show a fever of 102.1 F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/61 mmHg to 179/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, lorazepam, insulin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 27.8 K/uL, hematocrit levels ranging from 21.8% to 27.8%, platelet count ranging from 155 to 226 K/uL, and normal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include continuing broad empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, monitoring fever curve and white blood cell"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 6
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change,
   leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia.
   .
   # Altered mental status/fever/tachycardia/leukocytosis: Concerning for
   sepsis.  Continues to be hemodynamically stable but febrile overnight
   to 102. No infectious source identified to date with blood, urine, CSF
   cultures NGTD.  Pscyhiatry does not feel that current symptoms are
   benzo withdrawal.  Of note, patient had similar symptoms
   post-operatively in [**11-30**] following post-op infection.  EEG negative for
   seizure.
   - Continue broad empiric coverage with vanco, levo, flagyl
   - CTAP to revaluate for infectious process.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data.
   - Continue primidone and dilantin
   - Follow-up neuro and psych recs if any
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 6 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient transfused 1u PRBC yesterday.  Hct this AM of 22 from
   23.5 post-transfusion yesterday. Likely represents post-op bleed in
   setting of baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC
   - Post transfusion hct check.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   .
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   .
   # FEN: TPN restarted yesterday. Replete as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female who is now POD 6 (postoperative day 6) from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, leukocytosis, anemia, and a swollen right hand. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and bipolar disorder. She has been experiencing similar symptoms post-operatively in the past following a post-operative infection. Her recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are concerning for sepsis. The absence of an identified infectious source in blood, urine, and CSF cultures suggests the need for continued broad empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Monitoring the fever curve and WBC count is also important.

2. Ventral hernia repair infection: The patient's recent surgery may be complicated by an infection. Antibiotics and CT imaging are recommended for further evaluation.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. A blood transfusion and close monitoring of the hematocrit (Hct) levels are necessary.

4. Psychiatric history: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is not receiving her usual psychotropic medications while hospitalized. Follow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is currently in the ICU, 7 days post-operation from ventral hernia repair. She has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), anemia, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of seizure disorder, bipolar disorder, and recurrent spontaneous abortions. She is currently on broad empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected sepsis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the potential for complications such as sepsis, infection at the surgical site, anemia, and thromboembolic events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, altered mental status, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and elevated blood pressures are concerning for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued broad empiric antibiotic coverage are necessary.

2. Infection at the surgical site: The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by an infection at the site of ventral hernia repair. This could lead to further complications if not adequately treated.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level and recent blood transfusion indicate the presence of anemia. It is likely due to post-operative bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and additional blood transfusions may be required.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 7 from ventral hernia
   repair with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and
   tachycardia.
   # Altered mental status/fever/tachycardia/leukocytosis: Concerning for
   sepsis.  Continues to be hemodynamically stable but febrile overnight
   to 102. No infectious source identified to date with blood, urine, CSF
   cultures NGTD.  Pscyhiatry does not feel that current symptoms are
   benzo withdrawal.  Of note, patient had similar symptoms
   post-operatively in [**11-30**] following post-op infection.  EEG negative for
   seizure.
   - Continue broad empiric coverage with vanco, levo, flagyl
   - CTAP to revaluate for infectious process.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data.
   - Continue primidone and dilantin
   - Follow-up neuro and psych recs if any
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 6 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   # Anemia: Patient transfused 1u PRBC yesterday.  Hct this AM of 22 from
   23.5 post-transfusion yesterday. Likely represents post-op bleed in
   setting of baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC
   - Post transfusion hct check.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   # FEN: TPN restarted yesterday. Replete as necessary.
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI
   # Access: RIJ
   # Code: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care.

   68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 7 from ventral hernia
   repair with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and
   tachycardia.
   # Sepsis: Marked leukocytosis, febrile. Tachypneic overnight. Normo- to
   hypertensive since admission to ICU. Source unclear. 1 out of 3 blood
   cultures from [**9-4**] with GPCs
 likely contaminant, although may be
   secondary to line placement or surgical intervention. RIJ catheter
   removed [**2101-9-8**] evening. Currently on vancomycin. Another possibility
   is C diff
 patient has loose stools (rectal tube in place); currently
   1 out of 2 C diff toxins negative. Given recent abdominal surgery, also
   possibility for intraabdominal source of infection. No abscess seen on
   CT, although study done without IV contrast. In addition, wound gram
   stain from [**9-7**] with no organisms. Currently on levofloxacin/flagyl.
   General surgery, plastic surgery involved
   - Continue vancomycin, although GPCs seen on [**11-25**] blood cultures is
   likely a contaminant
   - Monitor blood and wound cultures.
   - Continue levofloxacin and flagyl for anaerobic and gram negative
   coverage.
   - Monitor C diff toxin assay. Empirically start vancomycin PO for
   presumed C diff.
   - If C diff toxin negative, add Zosyn for broader coverage
   - Speak with surgery regarding possibility of intraabdominal process,
   and possible need for ex-lap to assess for source.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear origin. Diffuse encephalopathy by EEG.
   Differential includes pain, seizures, infection, CVA. Neurology,
   psychiatry involved. Patient currently off of psychotropic meds
   differential also includes exacerbation secondary to severe stress of
   surgery.
   - Neurology, psychiatry recs
   - Control pain as best as possible
 currently on high-dose dilaudid
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 7 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   # Anemia: Transfused 1U pRBCs on [**2101-9-6**].  Hct 27 last night
 AM labs
   pending. Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of baseline ACD
   with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder who underwent ventral hernia repair. She is now in the ICU on POD 7, presenting with fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The source of infection is unclear, but there is marked leukocytosis, febrile response, and possible intraabdominal source of infection. The patient has loose stools, and C diff toxin assay is pending. She is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. There are no organisms seen on wound gram stain. The patient has altered mental status with unclear origin, possibly due to pain, seizures, infection, or CVA. Neurology and psychiatry are involved in her care. The patient is also anemic and received a blood transfusion. She has a history of psych disorder and recurrent spontaneous abortions, which may be related to hereditary thrombophilia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and hypertension, which are indicative of a possible sepsis. The source of infection is still unclear, but it could be secondary to line placement or surgical intervention. The patient is currently on appropriate antibiotics, but further investigation and management are needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 6 from ventral hernia
   repair with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and
   tachycardia.
   # Altered mental status/fever/tachycardia/leukocytosis: Concerning for
   sepsis.  Continues to be hemodynamically stable but febrile overnight
   to 102. No infectious source identified to date with blood, urine, CSF
   cultures NGTD.  Pscyhiatry does not feel that current symptoms are
   benzo withdrawal.  Of note, patient had similar symptoms
   post-operatively in [**11-30**] following post-op infection.  EEG negative for
   seizure.
   - Continue broad empiric coverage with vanco, levo, flagyl
   - CTAP to revaluate for infectious process.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up culture (blood, urine, CSF) data.
   - Continue primidone and dilantin
   - Follow-up neuro and psych recs if any
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 6 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   # Anemia: Patient transfused 1u PRBC yesterday.  Hct this AM of 22 from
   23.5 post-transfusion yesterday. Likely represents post-op bleed in
   setting of baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC
   - Post transfusion hct check.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.
   # FEN: TPN restarted yesterday. Replete as necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, who is currently in the ICU six days post-ventral hernia repair. The patient has been experiencing fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. She has been receiving broad empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The cultures from blood, urine, and CSF are negative for any infectious source. The patient's symptoms are concerning for sepsis, but she remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient's mental status changes could potentially be related to her underlying psychiatric history of bipolar disorder, but the presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests an infectious cause. The patient's leukocyte count has been increasing over time. She also has anemia, which may be due to post-operative bleeding in the setting of her baseline anemia with low ferritin and total iron-binding capacity.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.9°F (39.4°C), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 120/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her central venous pressure is 18 mmHg, and she has received a total of 3,677 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,845 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder who is now post-operative day (POD) 6 from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are concerning for sepsis. The lack of identified infectious source with blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures necessitates continued broad empiric coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Monitoring the fever curve and white blood cell count is also important.

2. Infection in the ventral hernia repair site: The patient is POD 6 from ventral hernia repair, which is now likely complicated by an infection. Antibiotics and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis (CTAP) should be continued as mentioned above. Following up with general and plastic surgery recommendations is crucial.

3. Anemia: The patient has received a blood transfusion but still has a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level. This may represent post-operative bleeding, especially considering the patient's baseline anemia with ferritin/total iron-binding capacity (Fe/TIBC) below 20%. Transfusing"

   68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 7 from ventral hernia
   repair with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and
   tachycardia.
   # Sepsis: Marked leukocytosis, febrile. Tachypneic overnight. Normo- to
   hypertensive since admission to ICU. Source unclear. 1 out of 3 blood
   cultures from [**9-4**] with GPCs
 likely contaminant, although may be
   secondary to line placement or surgical intervention. RIJ catheter
   removed [**2101-9-8**] evening. Currently on vancomycin. Another possibility
   is C diff
 patient has loose stools (rectal tube in place); currently
   1 out of 2 C diff toxins negative. Given recent abdominal surgery, also
   possibility for intraabdominal source of infection. No abscess seen on
   CT, although study done without IV contrast. In addition, wound gram
   stain from [**9-7**] with no organisms. Currently on levofloxacin/flagyl.
   General surgery, plastic surgery involved
   - Continue vancomycin, although GPCs seen on [**11-25**] blood cultures is
   likely a contaminant
   - Monitor blood and wound cultures.
   - Continue levofloxacin and flagyl for anaerobic and gram negative
   coverage.
   - Monitor C diff toxin assay. Empirically start vancomycin PO for
   presumed C diff.
   - If C diff toxin negative, add Zosyn for broader coverage
   - Speak with surgery regarding possibility of intraabdominal process,
   and possible need for ex-lap to assess for source.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear origin. Diffuse encephalopathy by EEG.
   Differential includes pain, seizures, infection, CVA. Neurology,
   psychiatry involved. Patient currently off of psychotropic meds
   differential also includes exacerbation secondary to severe stress of
   surgery.
   - Neurology, psychiatry recs
   - Control pain as best as possible
 currently on high-dose dilaudid
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 7 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   # Anemia: Transfused 1U pRBCs on [**2101-9-6**].  Hct 27 last night
 AM labs
   pending. Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of baseline ACD
   with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, currently on postoperative day (POD) 7 from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The source of infection is unclear, but possibilities include sepsis, Clostridium difficile (C diff), or an intraabdominal source. She is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage. Her mental status may be due to pain, infection, seizures, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She also has a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions and a family history of thrombophilia, which raises the possibility of a thromboembolic CNS insult. Anemia is likely postoperative bleeding in the setting of baseline anemia with low ferritin and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). The patient's psychotropic medications have been held off for now. She requires continued monitoring, including blood and wound cultures, and further evaluation by general surgery, plastic surgery, neurology, and psychiatry. Potential medical complications include sepsis, C diff colitis, intraabdominal infection, thromboembolic disease, and stress-related mucosal damage."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 7 from ventral hernia
   repair with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and
   tachycardia.
   # Sepsis: Marked leukocytosis, febrile. Tachypneic overnight. Normo- to
   hypertensive since admission to ICU. Source unclear. 1 out of 3 blood
   cultures from [**9-4**] with GPCs
 likely contaminant, although may be
   secondary to line placement or surgical intervention. RIJ catheter
   removed [**2101-9-8**] evening. Currently on vancomycin. Another possibility
   is C diff
 patient has loose stools (rectal tube in place); currently
   1 out of 2 C diff toxins negative. Given recent abdominal surgery, also
   possibility for intraabdominal source of infection. No abscess seen on
   CT, although study done without IV contrast. In addition, wound gram
   stain from [**9-7**] with no organisms. Currently on levofloxacin/flagyl.
   General surgery, plastic surgery involved
   - Continue vancomycin, although GPCs seen on [**11-25**] blood cultures is
   likely a contaminant
   - Monitor blood and wound cultures.
   - Continue levofloxacin and flagyl for anaerobic and gram negative
   coverage.
   - Monitor C diff toxin assay. Empirically start vancomycin PO for
   presumed C diff.
   - If C diff toxin negative, add Zosyn for broader coverage
   - Speak with surgery regarding possibility of intraabdominal process,
   and possible need for ex-lap to assess for source.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear origin. Diffuse encephalopathy by EEG.
   Differential includes pain, seizures, infection, CVA. Neurology,
   psychiatry involved. Patient currently off of psychotropic meds
   differential also includes exacerbation secondary to severe stress of
   surgery.
   - Neurology, psychiatry recs
   - Control pain as best as possible
 currently on high-dose dilaudid
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 7 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - Antibiotics and CTAP as above.
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters.
   # Anemia: Transfused 1U pRBCs on [**2101-9-6**].  Hct 27 last night
 AM labs
   pending. Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of baseline ACD
   with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   # Right hand swelling: RUE ultrasound negative for DVT.
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.  Would recommend outpatient work-up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is POD 7 from ventral hernia repair with a fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. She has a history of seizure disorder and bipolar disorder. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl, primidone, dilantin, seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, and remeron.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has marked leukocytosis, febrile, and tachypneic overnight. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be secondary to line placement or surgical intervention. The patient is currently on vancomycin for the infection.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has loose stools, and one out of two C. difficile toxins is negative. She is being empirically treated with vancomycin PO for presumed C. difficile infection.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has unclear origin altered mental status, which could be due to pain, seizures, infection, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Neurology and psychiatry are involved in the evaluation and management of this condition.
4. Ventral hernia repair complications: The patient is POD 7 from ventral hernia repair, which is now likely complicated by an infection. Antibiotics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, now POD 8 from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), anemia, and tachycardia. She has been experiencing recurrent spontaneous abortions and has a family history of recurrent miscarriages and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) concerning for hereditary thrombophilia. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl for infection coverage, as well as primidone and dilantin for seizure control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has marked leukocytosis and fever, indicating a potential infection. The source of infection is unclear, but possible sources include intraabdominal infection due to recent abdominal surgery or a line-related infection. The patient is currently on vancomycin for treatment.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing diffuse encephalopathy with unclear origin. Differential diagnoses include pain, seizures, infection, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Neurology and psychiatry consultations have been requested, and pain management is ongoing.
3. Decreased Urine Output: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output. Fluid boluses have been provided as needed, and further investigation into urine electrolytes, osmolality, and renal ultrasound may be necessary if no improvement is seen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent ventral hernia repair and lysis of adhesions. She is currently experiencing altered mental status, significant abdominal pain, persistent fevers, and signs of ongoing infection. The patient has leukocytosis and a high temperature. Despite being hemodynamically stable, she was unable to have a PICC line placed due to signs of infection. Antibiotics were changed for broader coverage. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103F, heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure of 120/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 2L nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Disease: The patient's rising leukocytosis and fevers suggest an ongoing infection. Since all cultures are negative, alternative sources of infection need to be explored, such as the abdominal wound post-surgery or sinusitis.
2. Gastrointestinal: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which could be related to post-operative complications. Checking liver function tests, amylase, and lipase is recommended to rule out pancreatitis.
3. Pulmonary: The patient's rising oxygen requirement indicates possible atelectasis. A chest X-ray should be done after line placement to further evaluate the respiratory system.
4. Hematology: The patient has evidence of lower extremity edema, and a clot should"

   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   - neuro to check dilantin level and t/c MRI when more stable to r/o CVA
   .
   # Decreased urine output: Continue to monitor. Provide fluid boluses
   prn. Pt with improved UOP with fluid challenge
   - will bolus fluids to maintain UOP >30cc/hr

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder who underwent ventral hernia repair surgery. She is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 124 bpm) and fever (temperature of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit). She has leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 44.4 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. The patient also has anemia, with a Hct level of 24.4%. Additionally, she has tachypnea, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is anxious, diaphoretic, and ill-appearing. Her cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia, and her respiratory examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds. The abdominal examination shows tenderness and firmness, with a vertical incision and new dressing.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Her blood glucose level is high at 336 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are indicative of tissue damage and inflammation.

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent ventral hernia repair 8 days ago. She is now experiencing fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The patient's condition is complicated by a non-resolving hematoma, which is concerning for a potential source of infection. The intra-abdominal source is the most likely cause given the recent surgery. Blood cultures show coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient has loose stools, but Clostridium difficile toxins are negative. There is also a possibility of thrombophlebitis in the upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's wound gram stain is negative for organisms. General surgery and plastic surgery are involved in her care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's marked leukocytosis, fever, and tachypnea overnight indicate the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but the non-resolving hematoma is a concern.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest an ongoing infection. The intra-abdominal source is most likely given the recent surgery.
3. Thrombophlebitis: The presence of a DVT and the patient's symptoms raise the possibility of thrombophlebitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 9
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change,
   leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia likely due to enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis continues to rise, this AM to 48.5.  Continues
   to be febrile up to 102.6.  Repeat CT abdomen concerning for
   enterocutaneous fistula. Xray of sponge versus VAC consistent with
   leak.  Plan per general surgery is to go to OR this morning. Less
   likely to be C.difficile colitis with negative C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name **] x3.
   - Will discuss with General [**Doctor First Name **] when patient is going and given 2u
   FFP.
   - Continue IV vancomycin and pip/tazo empiric therapy
   - Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Monitor MAPs, UOP, CVP and bolus as necessary
   - Follow-up official CT abdomen/pelvis read
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain.  Diffuse
   encephalopathy per EEG. Less likely to be seizure, CVA, or withdrawal.
   - Follow-up neurology and psychiatry recs if any
   - Continue dilaudid prn
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 9 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - OR today
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct today is 26.9. Has been transfused a total of 3u during
   hospital course.  Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of
   baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Crossmatched for 2u PRBC.
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   .
   # Right hand swelling: RUE U/S showed non-occlusive DVT in RIJ and
   sublavian.  Will not start heparin gtt given patient is going to OR
   today.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, now POD 9 from ventral hernia repair, who is presenting with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. These symptoms are likely due to an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient has a rising leukocyte count and continues to have fevers up to 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen is concerning for an enterocutaneous fistula, and the plan is to go to the operating room this morning. Less likely to be C. difficile colitis since the C. difficile toxin tests have been negative three times. 

The patient will be given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and will continue on IV vancomycin and pip/tazo empiric therapy. PO vancomycin and IV flagyl will also be continued for C. difficile coverage. Follow-up culture data, trend fever curve, and WBC count will be monitored. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine output (UOP), and central venous pressure (CVP) will be monitored, and fluid resuscitation as necessary. Follow-up with official CT abdomen/pelvis read is also planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 9
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change,
   leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia likely due to enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis continues to rise, this AM to 48.5.  Continues
   to be febrile up to 102.6.  Repeat CT abdomen concerning for
   enterocutaneous fistula. Xray of sponge versus VAC consistent with
   leak.  Plan per general surgery is to go to OR this morning. Less
   likely to be C.difficile colitis with negative C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name **] x3.
   - Will discuss with General [**Doctor First Name **] when patient is going and given 2u
   FFP.
   - Continue IV vancomycin and pip/tazo empiric therapy
   - Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Monitor MAPs, UOP, CVP and bolus as necessary
   - Follow-up official CT abdomen/pelvis read
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain.  Diffuse
   encephalopathy per EEG. Less likely to be seizure, CVA, or withdrawal.
   - Follow-up neurology and psychiatry recs if any
   - Continue dilaudid prn
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 9 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - OR today
   - Follow-up with general and plastic surgery recs
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct today is 26.9. Has been transfused a total of 3u during
   hospital course.  Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of
   baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Crossmatched for 2u PRBC.
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   .
   # Right hand swelling: RUE U/S showed non-occlusive DVT in RIJ and
   sublavian.  Will not start heparin gtt given patient is going to OR
   today.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female who is postoperative day (POD) 9 from ventral hernia repair. She has been experiencing fever, mental status change, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), anemia (low hemoglobin level), and tachycardia (high heart rate). These symptoms are likely due to an enterocutaneous fistula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/54 to 133/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and elevated lactate levels. The patient also has a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus.

The patient is planned to undergo surgery tomorrow morning due to the suspected enterocutaneous fistula. She will receive 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before the surgery. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam will continue, along with coverage for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to sepsis and pain, but other potential causes such as seizure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or withdrawal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is postoperative day 9 (POD 9) from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia, likely due to an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient has a history of seizure disorder, bipolar disorder, and recurrent spontaneous abortions. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has multiple comorbidities including a possible hereditary thrombophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia suggest a possible sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Enterocutaneous Fistula: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings indicate the presence of an enterocutaneous fistula. This condition can lead to ongoing fluid and electrolyte losses, infection, and malnutrition.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, likely secondary to postoperative bleeding or chronic disease. If left untreated, anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient's history of recurrent spontaneous abortions and family history of thrombophilia raise concerns for a thromboembolic event, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 9
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change,
   leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia likely due to enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis continues to rise, this AM to 48.5.  Continues
   to be febrile up to 102.6.  Repeat CT abdomen concerning for
   enterocutaneous fistula. Xray of sponge versus VAC consistent with
   leak.  Plan per general surgery is to go to OR this morning. Less
   likely to be C.difficile colitis with negative C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name **] x3.
   - Will discuss with General [**Doctor First Name **] when patient is going and given 2u
   FFP.
   - Continue IV vancomycin and pip/tazo empiric therapy
   - Continue PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Monitor MAPs, UOP, CVP and bolus as necessary
   - Follow-up official CT abdomen/pelvis read
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain.  Diffuse
   encephalopathy per EEG. Less likely to be seizure, CVA, or withdrawal.
   - Follow-up neurology and psychiatry recs if any
   - Continue dilaudid prn
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time

   # Anemia: Hct today is 26.9. Has been transfused a total of 3u during
   hospital course.  Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of
   baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Crossmatched for 2u PRBC.
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a seizure disorder, who is now postoperative day (POD) 9 after ventral hernia repair.
- She has been experiencing fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), anemia (low hemoglobin level), and tachycardia (elevated heart rate).
- The likely cause of these symptoms is an enterocutaneous fistula, which is a connection between the intestine and the skin.
- The patient has tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin three times, making C. diff colitis less likely.
- She has a rising WBC count and continues to have a fever.
- A CT scan of the abdomen is concerning for an enterocutaneous fistula.
- General surgery plans to take the patient to the operating room (OR) this morning.
- The patient will receive 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR.
- She will continue to receive IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) as empirical therapy for sepsis.
- PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl will be continued for C. diff coverage.
- Follow-up culture data, trend fever curve, WBC count, monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female who is post-operative day (POD) 9 from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia, which are likely due to an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers, with the highest temperature recorded at 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Her white blood cell count continues to rise, reaching 48.5 thousand cells per microliter.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended and tender abdomen, with a vertical incision that is firm and hypoactive. There are also two lateral Jackson Pratt (JP) drains in place. Her extremities show decreased pulses and poor perfusion. The patient's neurologic examination shows that she is oriented x2 and able to follow simple commands.

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 48.5 thousand cells per microliter. The hemoglobin level is 9.3 g/dL, indicating anemia. The platelet count is within normal range at 275 thousand cells per microliter. The blood cultures have grown coag-negative Staphylococcus, and the wound gram stain is negative.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breath"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1721**] is a 68 year old female with seizure disorder now POD 10
   from ventral hernia repair with fever, mental status change,
   leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia likely due to enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis this AM 38.7.  Continues to be febrile up to
   103.  Repeat CT abdomen concerning for enterocutaneous fistula. Xray of
   sponge versus VAC consistent with leak.  Patient did not go to OR
   yesterday, but plan to take patient to OR today.  INR today 1.4,
   patient received FFP and IV vitamin K yesterday.
   - Continue broad empiric coverag with vancomycin and pip/tazo
   - Continue C.diff coverage with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.  ID recs-
   stop IV flagyl.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Monitor MAPs, UOP, CVP and bolus as necessary
   - Follow-up official CT abdomen/pelvis read
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain.  Diffuse
   encephalopathy per EEG. Less likely to be seizure, CVA, or withdrawal.
   - Follow-up neurology and psychiatry recs if any
   - Continue dilaudid prn
   - Continue primidone, dilantin
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time
   .
   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 9 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release, now likely complicated by infection.
   - OR today, INR 1.4.
   - Follow-up with general [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct today is 24. Discussed with gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] and will hold off on
   transfusing pre-op.  Has been transfused a total of 3u during hospital
   course.  Likely represents post-op bleed in setting of baseline ACD
   with Fe/TIBC<20%.
   - Crossmatched for 2u PRBC.
   - Post-op hct check
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Tbili XXXX from 3.3 yesterday. Direct bili today
   of XXX.  Transaminases normal.
   - RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for biliary diltation.
   .
   # Psych: Patient with psych history significant for bipolar disorder.
   On seroquel, valium, ativan, celexa, wellbutrin, remeron at home which
   she has not been receiving while hospitalized.  Per psych, will not
   restart psychotropics for now.
   - Follow-up with pscyh
   .
   # Right hand swelling: RUE U/S showed non-occlusive DVT in RIJ and
   sublavian.  Will not start heparin gtt given patient is likely going to
   OR today.
   .
   # Thyroid: Continue levothyroxine 12.5 mcg iv daily
   .
   # Recurrent spontaneous abortions: Patient with 7 spontaneous
   miscarriages.  Family history significant for recurrent miscarriages
   and CVA concerning for hereditary thrombophilia.  It is possible that
   her mental status change was due to a new thromboembolic CNS insult,
   although this is less likely in setting of fever, leukocytosis, and
   tachycardia.
   - Lupus anticoagulant panel and ACA ab pending

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is now postoperative day (POD) 10 from ventral hernia repair. She has a history of seizure disorder and is currently experiencing fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. These symptoms are likely due to an enterocutaneous fistula. The patient did not undergo surgery yesterday but is planned for today. Her INR is within normal range today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is febrile and leukocytosis, indicating a potential infection. The presence of an enterocutaneous fistula increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes could be secondary to sepsis, pain, or a thromboembolic CNS insult. Further evaluation by neurology and psychiatry is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level, which may be due to postoperative bleeding or baseline anemia. Transfusion is being considered.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, with a direct bilirubin level increase. This could indicate biliary dilation, and an RUQ ultrasound is needed for further evaluation.
5. Right Hand Swelling: The patient has right upper extremity swelling, and a Doppler ultrasound showed non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is currently in the ICU after undergoing ventral hernia repair. She is experiencing fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), anemia, and tachycardia. The likely cause of these symptoms is an enterocutaneous fistula. She also has a history of seizure disorder and bipolar disorder. The patient did not go to surgery yesterday but will be taken to the operating room today. Her INR (international normalized ratio) is currently 1.4, and she received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and IV vitamin K yesterday. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as coverage for Clostridium difficile. Her vital signs include a temperature of 103.3°F, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 147/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia suggest sepsis, likely secondary to the enterocutaneous fistula.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status changes may be due to sepsis, pain, or a combination of both.
3. Anemia: The patient's"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, who is now postoperative day 10 from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status changes, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status suggest a possible infection, which may lead to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and surgical consultation is pending for possible debridement.

2. Enterocutaneous fistula or abscess: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging studies raise suspicion for an enterocutaneous fistula or abscess. Surgical intervention is planned to address this issue.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a non-occlusive DVT in the right internal jugular vein and subclavian vein. This needs to be managed appropriately, especially before the planned surgery.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is low at 24, indicating anemia. This could be due to postoperative bleeding or her baseline anemia exacerbated by the recent surgery.

5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin has increased from 3.3 to 4.1 mg/dL, with direct bilirubin at 3.5 mg/dL. Further evaluation with an RUQ ultrasound is needed to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who is now postoperative day (POD) 11 from ventral hernia repair. She has a history of seizure disorder and is experiencing fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia. The patient underwent an OR washout yesterday for hematoma evacuation. The infectious source has not yet been isolated, with negative wound cultures, C. diff negative x3, and blood cultures pending since September 5th. The patient's fever continues to be elevated at 102.9, and she has a leukocyte count of 38.7. The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain, with diffuse encephalopathy observed during admission. It is unlikely to be a seizure, CVA, or benzo withdrawal. The patient received an additional 500 mg IV dilantin yesterday with a subtherapeutic level this morning. She also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday afternoon, totaling 4 units transfused during her hospital course. This anemia likely represents post-op bleed in the setting of baseline ACD with Fe/TIBC <20%. The patient's bilirubin remains elevated at 4.5, mostly conjugated, with an AST now elevated to 45. RUQ ultrasound was negative for ductal dilatation. The patient has a history of psychotropic medication use, including sero"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, currently postoperative day 11 (POD 11) from ventral hernia repair. She presents with fever, mental status change, leukocytosis, anemia, and tachycardia after undergoing an OR washout for hematoma evacuation. The infectious source has not yet been isolated, with negative wound cultures and blood cultures pending. The patient also has a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions and a family history of recurrent miscarriages and cerebrovascular accident (CVA), suggesting a possible hereditary thrombophilia. She has been started on heparin gtt for a non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right internal jugular (RIJ) and subclavian vein.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and mental status change suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and inability to follow commands could be secondary to sepsis, pain, or a new thromboembolic central nervous system (CNS) insult.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which may be due to postoperative bleeding or baseline anemia with iron deficiency.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin level is mostly conjugated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-operative patient who underwent ventral hernia repair and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing sepsis and is showing signs of infection. The patient's temperature is elevated at 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a fever. The patient's heart rate is 111 beats per minute, blood pressure is 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient's CVP is 9 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient has received various interventions, including the placement of an arterial line, invasive ventilation, and the use of heparin sodium infusion. The patient has also received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 44.4 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The CT scan reveals evidence of an enterocutaneous fistula at the wound VAC site in the lower left anterolateral abdomen, with a tract to either small or large bowel not identified.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature and elevated WBC count indicate ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.

2. Enterocutaneous Fist"

   # Fever, leukcytosis: Leukocytosis this AM 38.7.  Continues to be
   febrile up to 102.9, both most likeyl secondary to infectious process.
   Patient taken to OR yesterday for washout/hematoma evacuation.
   Infectious source not yet isolated - wound cultures NGTD, C. diff
   negative x3, blood cultures since [**9-5**] NGTD.   Infectious work-up
   otherwise unremarkable thus far including LP, CTH, CT sinus.  Have also
   done bilateral LENIs.   Other non-infectious sources include drug
   fever, although unlikely given degree of fever and leukocytosis with
   accompanying tachycardia.  Although unlikely, also considering

   - Discuss with ID utility of tagged WBC scan.
   - Check for rectal abscess
   - Consider 24 hour urine cortisol or dex suppression test.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to sepsis +/- pain.  Diffuse
   encephalopathy per EEG during admission. Unlikely to be seizure, CVA,
   or benzo withdrawal.  Patient received additional 500 mg IV dilantin
   yesterday with level this AM subtherapeutic.
   - Follow-up neurology and psychiatry
   - Continue dilaudid prn
   - Continue primidone, dilantin.  Discuss with neuro re dilantin level.
   - Per psych recs, hold off on restarting psychotropic meds at this time

   # Ventral hernia repair: Patient is POD 11 from ventral hernia repair,
   LOA, and fascial release now POD 1 from hematoma evacuation/washout.
   - Follow-up with general [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   - Dilaudid prn with RR and sedation hold parameters as above.

   POD11.
   Initially in ICU due to mental status change. Fever, leukocytosis. No
   hypotension. Tachycardic. No lactic acidosis.
   Delirium with clearly lucid periods.
   Persistant leukocytosis and fever.
   Wound re-explored yesterday, though no ex-lap. CT not suggesting
   abdominal source of persistent infection.
   Summary:

   Initially on vanco/flagyl/levloflox, changed 4d ago to pip/tazo, IV and
   PO vanco, continued IV flagyl.

s but could
   consider 24 hour urine free cortisol or dexamethasone suppression test.
   This would only be useful if she suppressed cortisol, because if she
   remained elevated it could be attributed to critical illness
therefore
   ONLY negative predictive value.
   I doubt this is secondary to antibiotics, since she developed
   leukocytosis and fever prior to starting antibiotics, and with no
   change with change in antibiotics.
   Will consider whether tagged WBC scan may be helpful, though I think
   the results would be too nonspecific post-op.
   I respect the opinion of the surgical service that stopping antibiotics
   may help us determine a microbe, though I believe she has an active
   infection that we have not found.
