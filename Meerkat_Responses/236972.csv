   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   * Candidemia
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood culture
   correlates with being off micafungin on the floor, repeat cultures are
   negative. Her PICC is now out, though her original HD catheter is still
   in place. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole. If seeded bone/heart etc. or abscess formation longer
   course would have been required.
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities
   - Remove HD catheter, send tip for culture
   - Follow up pending cultures and repeat glucan
   - Will need eye exam
   - CT torso for look again for abscess
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. In setting of anticoagulation, consider also head
   bleed though would not expect her mental status to improve quickly
   without intervention. No obvious focal deficits, though neuro exam
   limited.
   - Hold all sedating meds
   - Will defer on narcan for now as mental status improved
   - CT head, holding heparin pending this study
   - Minimize sedation and follow neurologic exam closely
   - Consider EEG
   .
   * Leukocytosis
   Persistly elevated WBC in setting of recent rehab diagnosis of C diff,
   abdominal wound, multiple venous thromboses, lines and recent TPN. She
   continues to have fevers despite very broad spectrum treatment
   including meropenem, vancomycin PO and IV, micafungin. Her blood
   cultures have not grown any organisms and her ascites did not show
   evidence of infection on presentation. However her glucan was very high
   at presentation however, though we do not have a level from her prior
   admission. C diff assay here, in setting of treatment, was negative.
   Would consider: occult intrabdominal abscess, though not commented on
   admission CT abdomen; septic thrombophlebitis; empyema (R effusion
   loculated on CXR); line infection; endocarditis due to fastidious
   organism; severe C difficile infection. An untreated fungal infection
   whether due to anatomic barrier eg abscess or resistant mold needs to
   be considered with her high glucan.
   Of noninfectious causes, which I think are much less likely explanatory
   for her fevers and leukocytosis consider drug fever, vasculitis (eg PAN
   given hepB), clots.
   - Will continue current IV meropenem, IV vancomycin, PO vancomycin, IV
   metronidazole for now. Vanc level therapeutic today. If hemodynamically
   unstable consider amphotericin. If C diff diagnosis confirmed would
   treat with PO vanco at least 10d beyond end of systemic abx
   - Favor repeating CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast to assess for
   abscess
   - Would consider tapping R pleural effusion. Reasonable to consider
   repeat paracentesis again.
   - Would pull her R picc which has been in place for some time. Send tip
   for culture.
   - Repeating beta glucan today to assess response to micafungin
   - Follow up pending micro and culture if febrile
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Hypoxia
   Suspect this is due to volume overload primarily. Given her other clots
   would consider PE, though I think this is less likely as she has been
   on systemic anticoagulation. Could have aspirated in setting of altered
   mental status
   - Would favor additional volume removal at HD
   - Consider repeating TTE with bubble study
   - Repeat ABG
   - Likely able to extubate today as she is more awake
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin pending head CT
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * HTN
   BP near her recent baseline. Note that thigh pressures likely
   underestimate her BP.
   - Hold on further IVF at this time
   - Holding lisinopril
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>25

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B (HBV), and a history of prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with abdominal abscess, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), autoimmune cholangiopathy, and anemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, indicating candidemia. It is likely line-related, considering her total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She had a previous infection with Candida glabrata, which was treated with fluconazole. Micafungin has been continued pending speciation and sensitivities.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute onset of altered mental status is concerning for a seizure. Other possible causes include sedating medication effects, anticoagulation-related bleeding, or focal deficits. An EEG and CT head are planned to further evaluate the cause.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistently elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, which could be due to occult intrabdominal abscess, septic thrombophlebitis, empyema"

   - Minimize sedation and follow neurologic exam closely
   - Consider EEG
   .
   * Leukocytosis
   Persistly elevated WBC in setting of recent rehab diagnosis of C diff,
   abdominal wound, multiple venous thromboses, lines and recent TPN. She
   continues to have fevers despite very broad spectrum treatment
   including meropenem, vancomycin PO and IV, micafungin. Her blood
   cultures have not grown any organisms and her ascites did not show
   evidence of infection on presentation. However her glucan was very high
   at presentation however, though we do not have a level from her prior
   admission. C diff assay here, in setting of treatment, was negative.
   Would consider: occult intrabdominal abscess, though not commented on
   admission CT abdomen; septic thrombophlebitis; empyema (R effusion
   loculated on CXR); line infection; endocarditis due to fastidious
   organism; severe C difficile infection. An untreated fungal infection
   whether due to anatomic barrier eg abscess or resistant mold needs to
   be considered with her high glucan.
   Of noninfectious causes, which I think are much less likely explanatory
   for her fevers and leukocytosis consider drug fever, vasculitis (eg PAN
   given hepB), clots.
   - Will continue current IV meropenem, IV vancomycin, PO vancomycin, IV
   metronidazole for now. Vanc level therapeutic today. If hemodynamically
   unstable consider amphotericin. If C diff diagnosis confirmed would
   treat with PO vanco at least 10d beyond end of systemic abx
   - Favor repeating CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast to assess for
   abscess
   - Would consider tapping R pleural effusion. Reasonable to consider
   repeat paracentesis again.
   - Would pull her R picc which has been in place for some time. Send tip
   for culture.
   - Repeating beta glucan today to assess response to micafungin
   - Follow up pending micro and culture if febrile
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Hypoxia
   Suspect this is due to volume overload primarily. Given her other clots
   would consider PE, though I think this is less likely as she has been
   on systemic anticoagulation. Could have aspirated in setting of altered
   mental status
   - Would favor additional volume removal at HD
   - Consider repeating TTE with bubble study
   - Repeat ABG
   - Likely able to extubate today as she is more awake
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin pending head CT
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * HTN
   BP near her recent baseline. Note that thigh pressures likely
   underestimate her BP.
   - Hold on further IVF at this time
   - Holding lisinopril
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>25

   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   * Candidemia
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood culture
   correlates with being off micafungin on the floor, repeat cultures are
   negative. Her PICC is now out, though her original HD catheter is still
   in place. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate.
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities
   - Remove HD catheter, send tip for culture
   - Follow up pending cultures and repeat glucan
   - Will need eye exam
   - CT torso for look again for abscess
   - Repeat TTE, if negative and repeat + culture after HD lines out will
   need TEE
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Leukocytosis and fever
   At this point, leading dx is disseminated fungal infection, though she
   came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please see admit
   note for detailed ddx discussion. [**Female First Name (un) **] yesterday showed no evidence of
   empyema.
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco for now pending HD line
   removal/culture and CT torso. If nothing comes back, plan to keep on
   for 48hrs after code
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT.
   - Reassess with lightening of sedation
   - Check EEG
   - Consider neuro c/s
   * Hypoxia
   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect this is fluid
   related or related to altered mental status
   Favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   * Hypotension
   Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely, cardiogenic. Her propofol may be
   contributory. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   - Add on AM cortisol, and if still hypotensive, consider stress dose
   steroids
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Stop heparin in anticipation of pulling HD line
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   Removing HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent
   need for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a complex medical history including ESRD on HD, HBV, and recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement, along with gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia. She was transferred back to the MICU with altered mental status and found to have candidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia, which is a systemic fungal infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to disseminated fungal infection involving other organs such as the heart, bones, or lungs.

2. Line-related infection: The patient's candidemia is likely line-related, especially considering her recent use of TPN. If the source of infection is not appropriately managed, it can result in further complications such as sepsis or deep-seated abscesses.

3. Hepatitis B: The patient has a history of HBV. If her immune system becomes compromised due to prolonged illness or treatments, there is a risk of liver damage or reinfection.

4. Autoimmune cholangiopathy: The patient has been treated with prednisone, which is an immunosuppressive medication. This treatment may increase the risk of autoimmune cholangiopathy, a condition characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts.

5. Renal complications: As the patient has ESRD on HD"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   * Candidemia
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood culture
   correlates with being off micafungin on the floor, repeat cultures are
   negative. Her PICC is now out, though her original HD catheter is still
   in place. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate.
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities
   - Remove HD catheter, send tip for culture
   - Follow up pending cultures and repeat glucan
   - Will need eye exam
   - CT torso for look again for abscess
   - Repeat TTE, if negative and repeat + culture after HD lines out will
   need TEE
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Leukocytosis and fever
   At this point, leading dx is disseminated fungal infection, though she
   came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please see admit
   note for detailed ddx discussion. [**Female First Name (un) **] yesterday showed no evidence of
   empyema.
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin, IV vanco and PO vanco for now
   pending HD line removal/culture and CT torso
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT.
   - Reassess with lightening of sedation
   - Check EEG
   - Consider neuro c/s
   * Hypoxia
   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect this is fluid
   related
   Favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   * Hypotension
   Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely, cardiogenic. Her propofol may be
   contributory. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   Removing HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent
   need for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","The patient is a 48-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B, and a history of prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement due to an abdominal abscess. She also has gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia. The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and worsening leukocytosis, in the setting of recently diagnosed Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Candidemia: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast, indicating candidemia. This is likely line-related, especially since she was receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient had a previous line infection caused by Candida glabrata, which was treated with fluconazole for 23 days. If there is seeding of the bone, heart, venous clots, or abscess formation, a longer course of antifungal treatment may be necessary.

2. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which are common signs of infection. The leading diagnosis is disseminated fungal infection, although she had a reported C. difficile infection at the rehabilitation facility. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

3. Altered mental status: The patient experienced an acute onset of altered mental status, which improved rapidly after intubation for airway protection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. In setting of anticoagulation, consider also head
   bleed though would not expect her mental status to improve quickly
   without intervention. No obvious focal deficits, though neuro exam
   limited.
   - Hold all sedating meds
   - Will defer on narcan for now as mental status improved
   - CT head, holding heparin pending this study
   - Minimize sedation and follow neurologic exam closely
   - Consider EEG
   .
   * Leukocytosis
   Persistly elevated WBC in setting of recent rehab diagnosis of C diff,
   abdominal wound, multiple venous thromboses, lines and recent TPN. She
   continues to have fevers despite very broad spectrum treatment
   including meropenem, vancomycin PO and IV, micafungin. Her blood
   cultures have not grown any organisms and her ascites did not show
   evidence of infection on presentation. However her glucan was very high
   at presentation however, though we do not have a level from her prior
   admission. C diff assay here, in setting of treatment, was negative.
   Would consider: occult intrabdominal abscess, though not commented on
   admission CT abdomen; septic thrombophlebitis; empyema (R effusion
   loculated on CXR); line infection; endocarditis due to fastidious
   organism; severe C difficile infection. An untreated fungal infection
   whether due to anatomic barrier eg abscess or resistant mold needs to
   be considered with her high glucan.
   Of noninfectious causes, which I think are much less likely explanatory
   for her fevers and leukocytosis consider drug fever, vasculitis (eg PAN
   given hepB), clots.
   - Will continue current IV meropenem, IV vancomycin, PO vancomycin, IV
   metronidazole for now. Vanc level therapeutic today. If hemodynamically
   unstable consider amphotericin. If C diff diagnosis confirmed would
   treat with PO vanco at least 10d beyond end of systemic abx
   - Favor repeating CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast to assess for
   abscess
   - Would consider tapping R pleural effusion. Reasonable to consider
   repeat paracentesis again.
   - Would pull her R picc which has been in place for some time. Send tip
   for culture.
   - Repeating beta glucan today to assess response to micafungin
   - Follow up pending micro and culture if febrile
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Hypoxia
   Suspect this is due to volume overload primarily. Given her other clots
   would consider PE, though I think this is less likely as she has been
   on systemic anticoagulation. Could have aspirated in setting of altered
   mental status
   - Would favor additional volume removal at HD
   - Consider repeating TTE with bubble study
   - Repeat ABG
   - Likely able to extubate today as she is more awake
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin pending head CT
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * HTN
   BP near her recent baseline. Note that thigh pressures likely
   underestimate her BP.
   - Hold on further IVF at this time
   - Holding lisinopril
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>25

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B (HBV), and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to an abdominal abscess. She was also diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia.

The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status, which improved after intubation for airway protection. The acute onset and rapid improvement of her symptoms raise concern for a seizure, possibly related to her recent meropenem treatment or sedating medications. However, her mental status did not improve quickly without intervention, and there are no obvious focal deficits. The neurologic examination is limited.

The patient has persistently elevated white blood cell (WBC) count despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for suspected Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, abdominal wound infection, multiple venous thromboses, central venous catheters, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She continues to have fevers, and blood cultures have not grown any organisms. Her ascites did not show evidence of infection on presentation, but her glucan level was very high.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), who recently had an abdominal wound infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is currently in the ICU with altered mental status and is intubated on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

24-hour events include being trialed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but became tachypneic. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various doses of antibiotics since April 14th. She is currently on propofol infusion and heparin sodium infusion.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with diminished right radial pulse, absent right distal pulse, and decreased breath sounds in the chest. She also has cool skin, muscle wasting, and edema in both lower extremities.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Leukocytosis/fever with positive Candida auris blood culture - discontinuation of PICC line, removal of central venous catheter, continuation of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, consideration of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis.
2. Clostridium difficile infection - continuation of oral vancomycin and metronidazole.
3. Altered mental status - unclear etiology, possible sepsis, ruling out seizure activity with an electroencephalogram (EEG), continuous monitoring of neuro status.
4. Respiratory failure - transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and weaning off mechanical ventilation.
5. Hypotension - propofol infusion and volume shifts in setting of large volume paracentesis, continuous intravenous fluid resuscitation, consideration of levophed, and albumin administration if refractory.
6. Heparin for portal vein thrombosis - will hold for 6 hours prior to discontinuing the hemodialysis line.
7. Autoimmune cholangiopathy - completed steroid taper.
8. DM2 - RISS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood culture suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Immediate intervention is required to control the infection and prevent further deterioration.
2. Endocarditis: Given the positive Candida auris blood culture, there is a concern for endocarditis. A TEE should be performed to rule out this condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and weaning off mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously to avoid further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is concerning, especially in the setting of recent paracentesis. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's history of ESLD and the use of heparin suggest a concern for portal"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   * Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new RIJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate.  L thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma cx NGTD. . Still
   fevers overnight to 101F range. Weaned pressors overnight but now back
   on due to overnight SBPs dropping to 70s.  WBC slightly down from 26 to
   22 range.
   Ascites drainage negative for SBP and no fungus growing to date.
   .
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities.
   - may need to have  IJ from [**4-14**] removed
   - Will need eye exam
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week
   - f/u final CT torso final read
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan
   - daily blood cultures, f/u pending micro from ascites & pleural tap as
   well
   - f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   * Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBC slight drop to 22 today, fevers
   continued to 101F overnight. Still septic physiology requiring
   pressors. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  Now has 2 IJs in
   place still.
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco
   - HD line removal/culture and CT torso. If nothing comes back, plan to
   keep on for 48hrs after code
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT.
   - Reassess with lightening of sedation
   - Check EEG
   - Consider neuro c/s
   * Hypoxia
   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect this is fluid
   related or related to altered mental status
   Favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   * Hypotension
   Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely, cardiogenic. Her propofol may be
   contributory. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   - Add on AM cortisol, and if still hypotensive, consider stress dose
   steroids
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin in anticipation of new line
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   Removing HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent
   need for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of recent sepsis, C.diff infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She presents with altered mental status and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia and likely line-related in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Blood cultures are positive for yeast, indicating a fungal infection. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and portal venous and right internal jugular vein clots.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has candidemia and is at risk for further spread of the infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, hypotension, and need for vasopressors suggest ongoing sepsis.
3. Hepatitis B: The patient has hepatitis B, which can lead to liver complications and require specific treatment.
4. Autoimmune cholangiopathy: The patient's autoimmune condition affecting the bile ducts may require ongoing management and monitoring.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, which needs to be controlled through insulin therapy.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires monitoring and possible transfusion support.
7. Portal venous and right internal jugular vein clots:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   * Candidemia
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood culture
   correlates with being off micafungin on the floor, repeat cultures are
   negative. Her PICC is now out, though her original HD catheter is still
   in place. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate.
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities
   - Remove HD catheter, send tip for culture
   - Follow up pending cultures and repeat glucan
   - Will need eye exam
   - CT torso for look again for abscess
   - Repeat TTE, if negative and repeat + culture after HD lines out will
   need TEE
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Leukocytosis and fever
   At this point, leading dx is disseminated fungal infection, though she
   came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please see admit
   note for detailed ddx discussion. [**Female First Name (un) **] yesterday showed no evidence of
   empyema.
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco for now pending HD line
   removal/culture and CT torso. If nothing comes back, plan to keep on
   for 48hrs after code
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT.
   - Reassess with lightening of sedation
   - Check EEG
   - Consider neuro c/s
   * Hypoxia
   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect this is fluid
   related or related to altered mental status
   Favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   * Hypotension
   Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely, cardiogenic. Her propofol may be
   contributory. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   - Add on AM cortisol, and if still hypotensive, consider stress dose
   steroids
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Stop heparin in anticipation of pulling HD line
   - Holding warfarin for now given anticipated procedures
   .
   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   Removing HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent
   need for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin
   .
   * Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B (HBV), and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to an abdominal abscess. She was also diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia. The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and candidemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Candidemia: The patient has candidemia, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. This infection is likely line-related, especially since she was receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's previous line infection with C. glabrata was treated with fluconazole for 23 days. If the candidemia has spread to other organs such as the bone, heart, or venous clots, a longer treatment duration may be necessary. 

2. Leukocytosis and Fever: The patient's leukocytosis and fever could be attributed to the disseminated fungal infection. However, she also had a reported case of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection at her rehabilitation facility. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis of C. diff.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute onset of altered mental status and rapid improvement raises concerns for a seizure. It is important to reassess her condition with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B (HBV), recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to an abdominal abscess, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia. She was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with altered mental status and found to have candidemia. The patient has leukocytosis and fever, altered mental status, hypoxia, hypotension, an abdominal wound, portal venous and right internal jugular (RIJ) clots, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, ESRD on HD, diabetes mellitus (DM), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has candidemia and a history of previous C. glabrata line infection treated with fluconazole for 23 days. There is a concern for the possibility of seeding in organs such as the bone, heart, or venous clots.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, especially considering her positive blood cultures indicating candidemia and gram-negative bacteremia.

3. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which may be related to fluid overload or altered mental status. It is important to continue weaning off sedation and ensuring proper oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new IJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate. Left thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from
   thigh NGTD. . Still fevers overnight to 101F range. Weaned pressors
   overnight but now back  on due to overnight SBPs dropping to 70s.  WBC
   slightly down from 26 to 22 range. Ascites drainage negative for SBP
   and no fungus growing to date.
   .
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities.
   - daily cultures for now
   - stop TPN for now
   - holding off on Ambisome for now
   - may need to have left IJ removed  that was placed [**4-14**] given positive
   cultures on that date
   - consider femoral line placement this afternoon vs. new HD line ( will
   d/w renal)
   - will likely need new A-line as well
   - will need eye exam / ophthalmology consult today
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u final CT torso final read
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan
   - daily blood cultures, f/u pending micro from ascites & pleural tap as
   well
   - f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBC slight drop to 22 today, fevers
   continued to 101F overnight. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  Now has left
   IJs in place still.
   - trending fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - formal eye exam/ophthalmology consult as above
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C. diff diagnosis

   - Consider neuro c/s
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Now had 2L
   taken off abd yesterday and pleural effusions better.
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Normal cortisol levels this morning. CVP 12 now.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently

   Assessment and Plan
   This 48 year old woman with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolongued
   hospitalization for PEG c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement
   along with gram negative bacteremia and candidemia returned from her
   rehab facility with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of
   recently diagnosed C difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the
   MICU with altered mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   * Candidemia
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood culture
   correlates with being off micafungin on the floor, repeat cultures are
   negative. Her PICC is now out, though her original HD catheter is still
   in place. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate.  L thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma cx NGTD
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities
   - Needs to have IJ from 4.15 removed
   - Will need eye exam
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week
   - f/u final CT torso read
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - daily blood cultures, f/u pending micro
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Leukocytosis and fever
   At this point, leading dx is disseminated fungal infection, though she
   came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please see admit
   note for detailed ddx discussion. [**Female First Name (un) **] yesterday showed no evidence of
   empyema.
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco for now pending HD line
   removal/culture and CT torso. If nothing comes back, plan to keep on
   for 48hrs after code
   - [**Female First Name (un) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C diff diagnosis
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT.
   - Reassess with lightening of sedation
   - Check EEG
   - Consider neuro c/s
   * Hypoxia
   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect this is fluid
   related or related to altered mental status
   Favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   * Hypotension
   Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely, cardiogenic. Her propofol may be
   contributory. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   - Add on AM cortisol, and if still hypotensive, consider stress dose
   steroids
   .
   * Abdominal wound
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   * Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin in anticipation of new line

   * HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy
   S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   Removing HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent
   need for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   * DM
   - Continue insulin

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and a history of prolonged hospitalization for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement due to an abdominal abscess. She presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in the setting of recently diagnosed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient was found to have candidemia, likely line-related in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She also has a positive blood culture for yeast and a history of prior Candida glabrata line infection treated with fluconazole for 23 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has candidemia, which may progress to disseminated fungal infection if not appropriately managed.
2. Line-related infection: The patient has a history of previous line-related infections, including Candida glabrata infection.
3. C. diff infection: The patient has recently been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which can lead to complications such as pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, or fulminant colitis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis secondary to the disseminated fungal infection or other underlying conditions.
5. Altered mental status"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

Over the past 24 hours, several interventions have been performed, including re-tapping of an intravenous line, obtaining blood cultures, starting tube feeds, and replacing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/49 mmHg to 148/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The kidney function tests show elevated creatinine levels and decreased clearance. The liver function tests are within normal range, with slightly elevated liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are also within normal range.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, and other ICU medications. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   [**4-14**] are positive which is the day L IJ and a-line were placed.  Also
   concern that fungus may be colonizing intravascular clots.
   -Continue micafungin for now until sensi's on fungus known.
   -Change IJ line to new site.  Resite A-line.
   -If cultures from yesterday are negative at 48 hours, will likely scale
   back antibacterials
   -[**Month/Year (2) 1163**] to be done next week
   -Daily surveillance cultures

   -Currently on a small amount of pressors.  CVP reasonable.  Will
   continue pressors and wean as able.  Will be sparing with volume given
   ESRD and preference for a line holiday for as long as possible.
   2.) Respiratory Failure:  Oxygenating well.  Currently overventilating
   on A/C.  Some tachypnea earlier in the week on PSV.
   -PSV trial today now that ascites and effusion are improved with taps.
   3.) Cdif: cont po vanc and flagyl; will likely require prolonged course
   4.) Altered mental status: Cleared quickly here.  Head CT
   unremarkable.  EEG with diffuse slowing.  Likely toxic metabolic.
    -Avoid offending meds as able.
    -Daily awakening.
    5.)  Renal:  Currently on HD holiday.  Will monitor lytes, acid/base,
   volume daily to assess need for RRT
    6.) A/C:
   - heparin for portal vein thrombosis.  Currently on hold for impending
   line changes.  Will restart after.
   7). Autoimmune cholangiopathy: completed  steroid taper
   8.)  FEN:  Will stop TPN given multiple +fungal cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hepatitis B cirrhosis. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged period after experiencing complications from an abdominal wound and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient is currently dealing with fungemia as well. 

The patient's current assessment includes hypotension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic renal failure, and sepsis. The likely source of sepsis is fungemia. The patient's lines have been changed, but cultures from previous days are still positive. There is concern that the fungus may be colonizing intravascular clots.

The plan of care includes continuing micafungin until the sensitivity of the fungus is known. The inferior vena cava (IVC) line will be changed to a new site, and the arterial line will be repositioned. Antibacterials may be reduced if cultures from yesterday are negative at 48 hours. A nephrology consult is scheduled for next week, and daily surveillance cultures will be performed.

In terms of respiratory management, the patient is oxygenating well but is currently overventilating on assist-control (A/C) mode. A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial will be conducted today since ascites and effusion have improved with taps.

Regarding Clostridium difficile (C. diff), vancomycin and metronidazole will be continued, and it"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hepatitis B cirrhosis. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged period after experiencing complications from an abdominal wound and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient now has fungemia and is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis due to fungemia. Lines have been changed, but previous cultures were positive, indicating the possibility of colonization by fungus in intravascular clots. 
   - Continue micafungin until the sensitivity of the fungus is known.
   - Change the inferior vena cava (IVC) line to a new site and re-site the arterial line.
   - If cultures from yesterday are negative at 48 hours, antibacterials may be scaled back.
   - Perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) next week.
   - Conduct daily surveillance cultures.
   - Schedule an ophthalmic consultation.
   - Maintain a small amount of pressors. Keep central venous pressure (CVP) reasonable. Continue pressors and wean as able. Avoid excessive fluid administration due to ESRD and preference for a line holiday for as long as possible.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is oxygenating well but is overventilated on assist-control (A/C) mode. Some tachypnea was observed earlier in the week"

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Female First Name (un) 444**] with a history of prior yeast infection, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/49 to 177/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and other respiratory parameters within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but generally within normal range. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. The patient's urine output has been stable, with a total output of 546 mL over the past 24 hours.

   CT torso:
   1. No CT evidence of disseminated fungal infection. Large amount of
   ascites
   within the abdomen and pelvis. Diffuse bowel wall thickening which may
   be
   related to third spacing. However, given history of C. difficile
   infection,
   bowel wall thickening of the colon could also represent colitis.
   2. Continued hypoenhancement of the kidneys bilaterally, unchanged from
   [**4-5**], [**2168**], again concerning for cortical necrosis.
   3. Peripheral nonenhancement of the spleen, unchanged, consistent with
   splenic infarction.
   4. Central venous line ends within the upper inferior vena cava,
   unchanged.
   5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   6. Diffuse anasarca, worsening.
   Assessment and Plan :
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis transferred back to the MICU with altered mental
   status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Lines re-changed yesterday [**4-16**]. Patient
   had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with fluconazole x23d. If
   seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess formation 3 week course would
   have likely been inadequate. Left thigh fluid collection previously
   drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from thigh NGTD.  She had no more
   fevers overnight but  is still very dependent on pressors. WBC still
   elevated at 23 ( has been ranging  22-26) .  So far, ascites drainage
   negative for SBP and no fungus growing to date.  She has clean eye exam
   with ophthalmology yesterday.
   .
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Continue micafungin & additional Ambisome
   - daily blood cultures for now
   - holding all TPN for now
   - new A-line and right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all
   old lines removed
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan & dimorphic fungi blood cultures
   -  f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBCs still in 22-23 range but fevers
   have tapered. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  - trending
   fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - ID following, discuss regarding taking off antibacterials
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant pseudomonas)
   but talk to ID regarding whether needs these, IV vanco and PO vanco
   given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Mental
   status improved today.
   - Trial SBT again today for 30-60min to see whether can trial
   extubation today
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration.
   .
   # Altered mental status
   Still intubated for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low dose Levophed but unable
   to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   .
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - On heparin gtt
   .
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   Removed HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent need
   for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Also d/w renal
   new line options/discussion.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of sepsis, C. difficile infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She is currently experiencing candidemia and is dependent on pressors. The patient has altered mental status and is intubated for airway protection. She has leukocytosis and fever, which may be indicative of a disseminated fungal infection. She also has hypoxia, hypotension, and an altered mental status. The patient has a history of ESRD on HD, Hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, diabetes, and anemia. She is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and medications for her other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has positive blood cultures indicating candidemia, a fungal infection caused by Candida species. It is important to continue antifungal therapy and monitor for any signs of progression or dissemination of the infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and dependence on pressors suggest ongoing sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection(s) are crucial.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's intubation is primarily for airway protection due to altered mental status. Weaning off sedation and performing spontaneous breathing trials should be considered to assess readiness for extubation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with recent sepsis, C.diff infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She presents with altered mental status. The patient has a history of prior yeast infection with alternative yeast species. She requires extensive cataract evaluation as an outpatient but currently shows no signs of fungal eye infections.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 112/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 16 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including amikacin, micafungin, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. She is also receiving norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and propofol infusions in the ICU.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,347 mL with outputs of 70 mL urine and 600 mL stool. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.48, PaO2/FiO2 ratio"

   Assessment and Plan :
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new IJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate. Left thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from
   thigh NGTD.  She had no more fevers overnight but  is still very
   dependent on pressors. WBC still elevated at 23 ( has been ranging
   22-26) .  So far, ascites drainage negative for SBP and no fungus
   growing to date.  She has clean eye exam with ophthalmology yesterday.
   .
   - Continue micafungin & additional Ambisome for now pending speciation
   and sensitivities.
   - daily blood cultures for now
   - holding all TPN for now
   - new A-line and right femoral CVL re-sited for fresh access / all old
   lines removed
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u final CT torso final read
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan & dimorphic fungi blood cultures
   -  f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBCs still in 22-23 range but fevers
   have tapered. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  - trending
   fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   .
   # Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean  sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Now had 2L
   taken off abd yesterday and pleural effusions better.
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with recent sepsis, C. difficile infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She presents with altered mental status and now has candidemia with pressor-dependent blood pressure. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, diabetes mellitus, and anemia. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 112/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple intravenous medications including norepinephrine, heparin, propofol, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could be indicative of a disseminated fungal infection. The recent diagnosis of C. difficile infection and candidemia supports this concern.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology requiring pressors intermittently suggests ongoing sepsis.
3. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for airway protection but is now oxygenating better. However, there is still tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV), suggesting possible fluid-related or altered mental status-related hypoxia"

   Assessment and Plan :
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new IJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate. Left thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from
   thigh NGTD. . Still fevers overnight to 101F range. Weaned pressors
   overnight but now back  on due to overnight SBPs dropping to 70s.  WBC
   slightly down from 26 to 22 range. Ascites drainage negative for SBP
   and no fungus growing to date.
   .
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities.
   - daily cultures for now
   - stop TPN for now
   - holding off on Ambisome for now
   - may need to have left IJ removed  that was placed [**4-14**] given positive
   cultures on that date
   - consider femoral line placement this afternoon vs. new HD line ( will
   d/w renal)
   - will likely need new A-line as well
   - will need eye exam / ophthalmology consult today
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u final CT torso final read
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan
   - daily blood cultures, f/u pending micro from ascites & pleural tap as
   well
   - f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBC slight drop to 22 today, fevers
   continued to 101F overnight. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  Now has left
   IJs in place still.
   - trending fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - formal eye exam/ophthalmology consult as above
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C. diff diagnosis
   .
   # Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean  sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Now had 2L
   taken off abd yesterday and pleural effusions better.
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Normal cortisol levels this morning. CVP 12 now.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed yesterday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin in anticipation of new line
   .
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   Removed HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent need
   for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Also d/w renal

   Assessment and Plan :
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new IJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate. Left thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from
   thigh NGTD. . Still fevers overnight to 101F range. Weaned pressors
   overnight but now back  on due to overnight SBPs dropping to 70s.  WBC
   slightly down from 26 to 22 range. Ascites drainage negative for SBP
   and no fungus growing to date.
   .
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities.
   - daily cultures for now
   - stop TPN for now
   - holding off on Ambisome for now
   - may need to have left IJ removed  that was placed [**4-14**] given positive
   cultures on that date
   - consider femoral line placement this afternoon vs. new HD line ( will
   d/w renal)
   - will likely need new A-line as well
   - will need eye exam / ophthalmology consult today
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u final CT torso final read
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan
   - daily blood cultures, f/u pending micro from ascites & pleural tap as
   well
   - f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBC slight drop to 22 today, fevers
   continued to 101F overnight. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  Now has left
   IJs in place still.
   - trending fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant
   pseudomonas), IV vanco and PO vanco given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - formal eye exam/ophthalmology consult as above
   - CIS
   - Confirm OSH C. diff diagnosis
   .
   # Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean  sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Now had 2L
   taken off abd yesterday and pleural effusions better.
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Normal cortisol levels this morning. CVP 12 now.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed yesterday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin in anticipation of new line
   .
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   Removed HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent need
   for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Also d/w renal
   new line options/discussion.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of sepsis, C.difficile infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She presents with altered mental status and candidemia with blood pressure-dependent pressors. The patient has undergone several interventions including changing wound vac, removing HD line, placing new right femoral CVL and R A-line, and restarting heparin drip. She is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient's leukocytosis and persistent fever suggest a disseminated fungal infection, which is consistent with her recent diagnosis of C.difficile colitis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressors indicate ongoing sepsis. Her altered mental status and tachypnea may be related to fluid overload or infection.
3. Hypoxia: Intubation was performed primarily for airway protection rather than overt respiratory failure. However, the patient's oxygenation has improved, but she remains tachypneic on pressure support ventilation (PSV).
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis and fluid overload. Weaning of pressors should be done cautiously.
5. Abdominal wound infection: The patient's abdominal wound has been managed with a wound vacuum but may require surgical intervention based on recent imaging results.
6. Portal venous and right"

   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis. She is transferred back to the MICU with altered
   mental status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Her PICC  & HD now pulled out and new IJ
   placed [**4-14**]. Patient had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with
   fluconazole x23d. If seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess
   formation 3 week course would have likely been inadequate. Left thigh
   fluid collection previously drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from
   thigh NGTD. . Still fevers overnight to 101F range. Weaned pressors
   overnight but now back  on due to overnight SBPs dropping to 70s.  WBC
   slightly down from 26 to 22 range. Ascites drainage negative for SBP
   and no fungus growing to date.
   .
   - Continue micafungin for now pending speciation and sensitivities.
   - daily cultures for now
   - stop TPN for now
   - holding off on Ambisome for now
   - may need to have left IJ removed  that was placed [**4-14**] given positive
   cultures on that date
   - consider femoral line placement this afternoon vs. new HD line ( will

   # Altered mental status
   Now s/p intubation for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean  sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Now had 2L
   taken off abd yesterday and pleural effusions better.
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration. On AC ventilation
   - Would pursue additional volume removal as BP tolerates, may need CVVH
   - Continue on AC until done with procedures, then can trial on PS
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Normal cortisol levels this morning. CVP 12 now.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of sepsis, C.diff infection, multiple abdominal infections, and altered mental status. She is currently experiencing candidemia and requires pressor support. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of new central venous lines, removal of old lines, and changes in antibiotic therapy. She also has a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's abdominal wound is being managed with a wound vacuum, and she has a history of portal venous and right internal jugular vein clots.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient's leukocytosis and persistent fevers suggest a possible disseminated fungal infection, especially given her recent diagnosis of candidemia.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and need for pressors indicate ongoing sepsis, likely related to her candidemia and other infections.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's intubation was primarily for airway protection due to altered mental status. She is oxygenating better but remains tachypneic on pressure support ventilation (PSV), suggesting possible fluid overload or altered mental status contributing to respiratory distress.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is suspected to be related to sepsis, with possible contributions from intravascular volume overload and propof"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of sepsis, C.difficile infection, and multiple abdominal infections. She presents with altered mental status and has been diagnosed with candidemia. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, and fever. She has an abdominal wound that required debridement and is being managed with wound vac. The patient also has a history of hepatitis B and autoimmune cholangiopathy. She is currently on entecavir, tenofovir, and ursodiol. The patient's recent labs show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate a disseminated fungal infection, which needs to be further investigated and treated.
2. Candidemia: The patient has already been diagnosed with candidemia and is being treated with antifungal medication. It is important to monitor the response to treatment and adjust accordingly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, altered mental status, and fever suggest ongoing sepsis. Prompt and appropriate management is crucial to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo with ESRD and HBV cirrhosis with prolonged course after recent
   complicated abd wound and polymicrobial bacteremia.  Now with fungemia.
    1.) Sepsis:  Likely source fungemia.  All lines changed again
   yesterday.  Also concern that fungus may be colonizing intravascular
   clots.
   -Now on micafungin and ambisome per ID.  Cx now suggests [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   albicans.  Fluc sensis will be known tomorrow-->Will tailor regimen as
   able tomorrow.
   -Will discuss with ID re: ?scaling back some of the anti-bacterial
   regimen which is empiric.
   -TEE to be done next week
   -Daily surveillance cultures
   -Appreciate optho input
   -Still requiring a small amount of pressors.  Will continue to wean as
   able.
    2.) Respiratory Failure:  Oxygenating well.  Currently overventilating
   on PSV 12/5.
   -SBT this AM.  If passes would like to extubate today.
    3.) Cdif: cont po vanc and flagyl; will likely require prolonged
   course
    4.) Altered mental status: Cleared quickly here.  Head CT
   unremarkable.  EEG with diffuse slowing.  Likely toxic metabolic.
   Following commands and nodding appropriately today.
   -Avoid offending meds as able.
   -Daily awakening if remains intubated.
    5.)  Renal:  Currently on HD holiday.  No clear indication for RRT
   today although volume will eventually become an issue.
    6.) A/C:
   - Back on heparin gtt for portal vein thrombosis and R IJ thrombosis.
   Holding on coumadin given plans for new HD line in the future.
    7). Autoimmune cholangiopathy: completed  steroid taper
   8.)  FEN:  Off TPN.  Hold TF for possible extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis. He has had a prolonged course after a recent complicated abdominal wound and polymicrobial bacteremia. Currently, he is experiencing sepsis likely due to fungemia. His lines have been changed, and he is now on micafungin and ambisome per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. The culture suggests Candida albicans, and the regimen will be tailored accordingly. The patient also requires a small amount of pressors and continues to wean as able.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was performed this morning, and if successful, the plan is to extubate the patient today. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which will likely require a prolonged course. 

The patient's mental status is altered, but it has cleared quickly. A head CT was unremarkable, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse slowing, suggesting a toxic or metabolic cause. The patient is following commands and nodding appropriately today. 

Renal function is currently on hold, and there is no clear indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT) today. However, volume management will eventually become an issue. 

The patient is also on he"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo with ESRD and HBV cirrhosis with prolonged course after recent
   complicated abd wound and polymicrobial bacteremia.  Now with fungemia.
    1.) Sepsis:  Likely source fungemia.  All lines changed again
   yesterday.  Also concern that fungus may be colonizing intravascular
   clots.
   -Now on micafungin and ambisome per ID.  Cx now suggests [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   albicans.  Fluc sensis will be known tomorrow-->Will tailor regimen as
   able tomorrow.
   -Will discuss with ID re: ?scaling back some of the anti-bacterial
   regimen which is empiric.
   -TEE to be done next week
   -Daily surveillance cultures
   -Appreciate optho input
   -Still requiring a small amount of pressors.  Will continue to wean as
   able.
    2.) Respiratory Failure:  Oxygenating well.  Currently overventilating
   on PSV 12/5.
   -SBT this AM.  If passes would like to extubate today.
    3.) Cdif: cont po vanc and flagyl; will likely require prolonged
   course
    4.) Altered mental status: Cleared quickly here.  Head CT
   unremarkable.  EEG with diffuse slowing.  Likely toxic metabolic.
   Following commands and nodding appropriately today.
   -Avoid offending meds as able.
   -Daily awakening if remains intubated.
    5.)  Renal:  Currently on HD holiday.  No clear indication for RRT
   today although volume will eventually become an issue.
    6.) A/C:
   - Back on heparin gtt for portal vein thrombosis and R IJ thrombosis.
   Holding on coumadin given plans for new HD line in the future.
    7). Autoimmune cholangiopathy: completed  steroid taper
   8.)  FEN:  Off TPN.  Hold TF for possible extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a prolonged course of abdominal wound infection and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient now presents with fungemia, likely caused by Candida albicans. All lines have been changed, and the patient is being treated with micafungin and ambisome per infectious disease (ID) recommendations. The ID will discuss the possibility of scaling back some of the antibacterial regimen, which is currently empirical.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis due to fungemia. There is concern that the fungus may be colonizing intravascular clots.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is overventilating on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 12/5. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been performed, and if it is successful, the patient may be extubated today.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has C. diff infection, and it is being treated with continued administration of vancomycin and metronidazole. A prolonged course of treatment is anticipated.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to toxicity or metabolic imbalances. He is responsive to"

   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   - Patient with positive BCx [**4-11**], [**4-13**], [**4-14**] with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans
   likely in setting of TPN while off micafungin on floor. new A-line and
   right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all old lines
   removed
   Patient
s abx narrowed yesterday to remain only on micafungin, and
   cdiff coverage (PO vanc/flagyl). WBC continues to trend upwards without
   fever
 other site cultures have been negative (pleural fluid, left
   thigh fluid collection, peritoneal tap). Other site of seeding could be
   her valve with plan for TEE this week.
   .
   - ID following, appreciate recs regarding send out fungal sensitivities
   - Continue micafungin (restarted [**4-14**]) and cdiff tx with PO vanc
   (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**])
   - f/u cultures
   - holding all TPN for now
   - plan for TEE tomorrow
 call TEE fellow to confirm today
   .
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. No more fevers, but WBC
   trending upwards. Other sites to evaluate include abdominal wound and
   heart valves. Still septic physiology requiring low dose pressors.
   - ID following -
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - will hold off on repeat IR drainage of thigh fluid collections
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt respiratory
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, now on nasal cannula and doing
   well at 2L .  Initial SOB may have been fluid related or related to
   altered mental status. Less likely PE or aspiration.  Mental status
   improved today.
   - s/p extubation and doing well on NC at 2L , wean as tolerates
   - d/c Fentanyl today to limit sedation  ( Tylenol PRN)
   - favor additional volume removal, will get CVVH today.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Extubated yesterday and maintaining airway
   since. Mental status improved, but patient still lethargic with low
   energy. No evidence of seizures s/p extubation. Would be careful with
   narcotic medications as could have played role in lathergy/transfer
   back to MICU. Also may have element of uremia and hepatic related
   encephalopathy.
   -  continue to hold narcotics for now
   - getting CVVH , will help uremia effects
   -  treating infections as above
   - start lactulose today, follow up liver recs
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low
   dose Levophed but unable to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Plan for CVVH/HD today with
   placement of temp HD catheter today. Heparin on hold this AM in
   preparation
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Plan for temp line placement and CVVH/HD today
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - On heparin gtt
 holding for AM for HD catheter placement but will
   resume after procedure later today
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG placement, and abdominal abscess requiring debridement. She has been readmitted with C. difficile colitis and new candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient was successfully extubated on [**4-17**] and is now on a nasal cannula with improved oxygenation.
- She has been experiencing pain in her right lower extremity, for which she received two boluses of fentanyl.
- The patient's antibiotic regimen has been narrowed down to remain only on micafungin and cdiff coverage with PO vancomycin and flagyl.
- She will require hemodialysis (HD) today, and a temporary HD line will be placed tomorrow. Heparin gtt needs to be discontinued at 6 am tomorrow, and she will likely need 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to the procedure.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 110/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent pain"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, multiple antibiotics, antifungal medications, and vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but they have slightly low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. The respiratory rate is also slightly elevated, and the oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The physical examination findings are mostly not assessed, indicating the patient's unstable condition.

The laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, increased creatinine levels, decreased total carbon dioxide levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level. Other lab values such as glucose, lactate, albumin, and cardiac markers are also provided.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,376 mL with outputs including 60 mL of PO, 125 mL of TF, 921 mL of IVF, and 600 mL of blood products, resulting in a net fluid balance of -507 mL.

   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   - Patient with positive BCx [**4-11**], [**4-13**], [**4-14**] with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans
   likely in setting of TPN while off micafungin on floor. new A-line and
   right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all old lines
   removed
   Patient
s abx narrowed yesterday to remain only on micafungin, and
   cdiff coverage (PO vanc/flagyl). WBC continues to trend upwards without
   fever
 other site cultures have been negative (pleural fluid, left
   thigh fluid collection, peritoneal tap). Other site of seeding could be
   her valve with plan for TEE this week.
   - ID following, appreciate recs regarding send out fungal sensitivities
   - Continue micafungin (restarted [**4-14**]) and cdiff tx with PO vanc
   (day#1=[**4-11**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**])
   - f/u cultures
   - holding all TPN for now
   - plan for TEE tomorrow
 call TEE fellow to confirm
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. No more fevers, but WBC
   trending upwards. Other sites to evaluate include abdominal wound and
   heart valves. Still septic physiology requiring low dose pressors.
   - ID following -
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Mental
   status improved today.
   - Trial SBT again today for 30-60min to see whether can trial
   extubation today
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Extubated yesterday and maintaining airway
   since. Mental status improved, but patient still lethargic with low
   energy. No evidence of seizures s/p extubation. Would be careful with
   narcotic medications as could have played role in lathergy/transfer
   back to MICU
   - continue to hold narcotics
   -  treating infections as above
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. On low dose levophed but
   unable to wean off. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   Cortisol level normal. On very low dose Levophed but unable to wean off
   completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD
   Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Plan for CVVH/HD today with
   placement of temp HD catheter today. Heparin on hold this AM in
   preparation
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Plan for temp line placement and CVVH/HD today
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition: Consider Dophoff placement vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (likely will not be enough intake)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - On heparin gtt
 holding for AM
 resume after procedure

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old female with fungemia sepsis.
- She was successfully extubated on [**4-17**] and is now on micafungin and C. difficile coverage with PO vancomycin and flagyl.
- The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) today, and a temporary HD line will be placed tomorrow. Heparin gtt needs to be turned off at 6 am tomorrow, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be required prior to the procedure.
- The patient has a history of prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with abdominal abscess, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia.
- She has a new diagnosis of candidemia with Candida albicans.
- The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) continues to trend upwards without fever, indicating a possible disseminated fungal infection.
- Other sites to evaluate include the abdominal wound and heart valves.
- The patient is still septic physiology requiring low-dose pressors.
- She is hypoxic, mainly due to airway protection rather than overt respiratory failure.
- The patient's mental status has improved since extubation but remains lethargic with low energy.
- She is hypotensive and suspect septic etiology, requiring low-dose levophed but unable"

   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated around noon on [**4-17**]
   - had some c/o pain in RLE overnight and got 2 boluses Fentanyl
   - per ID, ok to discontinue ambisome, vanc, cefepime, so remains only
   on micafungin and C.difficile coverage with PO vanc and flagyl
   - will require HD today, so renal fellow to place temporary HD line
   tomorrow, need heparin gtt off at 6am tomorrow, likely 2 units FFP

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD, HBV, and recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG placement, who was readmitted with C. difficile colitis and found to have new candidemia with Candida albicans. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including sepsis, candidemia, hypoxia, altered mental status, hypotension, anemia, and DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia, which can potentially lead to a disseminated fungal infection if not treated promptly.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient was readmitted with C. difficile colitis, which can cause severe diarrhea and may require specific treatment.
3. Sepsis: The patient is still septic despite antibiotic therapy, indicating that the infection is not fully controlled.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which may be due to fluid overload or altered mental status.
5. Altered mental status: The patient is lethargic and has low energy, indicating a possible alteration in mental status.
6. Hypotension: The patient requires low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure, suggesting ongoing hypotension.
7. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia.
8. DM: The patient's diabetes management requires adjustment due to her current critical condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   - Patient with positive BCx [**4-11**], [**4-13**], [**4-14**] with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans
   likely in setting of TPN while off micafungin on floor. new A-line and
   right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all old lines
   removed
   Patient
s abx narrowed yesterday to remain only on micafungin, and
   cdiff coverage (PO vanc/flagyl). WBC continues to trend upwards without
   fever
 other site cultures have been negative (pleural fluid, left
   thigh fluid collection, peritoneal tap). Other site of seeding could be
   her valve with plan for TEE this week.
   - ID following, appreciate recs regarding send out fungal sensitivities
   - Continue micafungin (restarted [**4-14**]) and cdiff tx with PO vanc
   (day#1=[**4-11**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**])
   - f/u cultures
   - holding all TPN for now
   - plan for TEE tomorrow
 call TEE fellow to confirm
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. No more fevers, but WBC
   trending upwards. Other sites to evaluate include abdominal wound and
   heart valves. Still septic physiology requiring low dose pressors.
   - ID following -
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Mental
   status improved today.
   - Trial SBT again today for 30-60min to see whether can trial
   extubation today
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Extubated yesterday and maintaining airway
   since. Mental status improved, but patient still lethargic with low
   energy. No evidence of seizures s/p extubation. Would be careful with
   narcotic medications as could have played role in lathergy/transfer
   back to MICU
   - continue to hold narcotics
   -  treating infections as above
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. On low dose levophed but
   unable to wean off. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   Cortisol level normal. On very low dose Levophed but unable to wean off
   completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD
   Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Plan for CVVH/HD today with
   placement of temp HD catheter today. Heparin on hold this AM in
   preparation
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Plan for temp line placement and CVVH/HD today
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition: Consider Dophoff placement vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (likely will not be enough intake)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots

   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU for abdominal abscess debridement and treatment of gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia. The patient has been readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and new candidemia caused by Candida albicans. She is currently on invasive ventilation, successfully extubated around noon on [**4-17**]. The patient's condition is complicated by leukocytosis, fever, hypoxia, altered mental status, hypotension, ESRD on HD, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, abdominal wound, portal venous and right internal jugular vein clots, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible disseminated fungal infection, which is consistent with her candidemia.
2. Candida sepsis: The patient's candidemia may progress to candida sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV) indicates ongoing respiratory issues, possibly related to fluid overload or altered mental status. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   - Patient with positive BCx [**4-11**], [**4-13**], [**4-14**] with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans
   likely in setting of TPN while off micafungin on floor. new A-line and
   right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all old lines
   removed
   Patient
s abx narrowed yesterday to remain only on micafungin, and
   cdiff coverage (PO vanc/flagyl). WBC continues to trend upwards without
   fever
 other site cultures have been negative (pleural fluid, left
   thigh fluid collection, peritoneal tap). Other site of seeding could be
   her valve with plan for TEE this week.
   - ID following, appreciate recs regarding send out fungal sensitivities
   - Continue micafungin (restarted [**4-14**]) and cdiff tx with PO vanc
   (day#1=[**4-11**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**])
   - f/u cultures
   - holding all TPN for now
   - plan for TEE tomorrow
 call TEE fellow to confirm
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. No more fevers, but WBC
   trending upwards. Other sites to evaluate include abdominal wound and
   heart valves. Still septic physiology requiring low dose pressors.
   - ID following -
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - TEE to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Mental
   status improved today.
   - Trial SBT again today for 30-60min to see whether can trial
   extubation today
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Extubated yesterday and maintaining airway
   since. Mental status improved, but patient still lethargic with low
   energy. No evidence of seizures s/p extubation. Would be careful with
   narcotic medications as could have played role in lathergy/transfer
   back to MICU
   - continue to hold narcotics
   -  treating infections as above
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. On low dose levophed but
   unable to wean off. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded.
   Cortisol level normal. On very low dose Levophed but unable to wean off
   completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD
   Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Plan for CVVH/HD today with
   placement of temp HD catheter today. Heparin on hold this AM in
   preparation
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Plan for temp line placement and CVVH/HD today
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition: Consider Dophoff placement vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (likely will not be enough intake)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - On heparin gtt
 holding for AM
 resume after procedure

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with fungemia sepsis, who has undergone multiple interventions and procedures. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Candidemia/Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures indicating Candida albicans infection, likely acquired while on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and off micafungin. The patient is currently on micafungin and cdiff coverage with PO vancomycin and flagyl. Other site cultures have been negative, and there is a possibility of endocarditis, with plans for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) this week.

2. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient's white blood cell count is trending upwards without fever, indicating a potential disseminated fungal infection. Other sites to evaluate include the abdominal wound and heart valves.

3. Hypoxia: The patient was intubated for airway protection but is now extubated. The patient's oxygenation has improved, but they remain tachypneic on pressure support ventilation (PSV), suggesting fluid-related or altered mental status. A trial spontaneous breathing test (SBT) will be conducted today to assess readiness for extubation.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved since extubation but remains lethargic. No evidence of seizures post-extubation has been observed. Narcotic medications may have contributed to lethargy and should be used cautiously.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia returned from her rehab facility with
   lethargy and worsening leukocytosis in setting of recently diagnosed
   C.difficile colitis transferred back to the MICU with altered mental
   status and found to have candidemia.
   .
   # Candidemia / Sepsis
   Likely line related in the setting of TPN. Positive blood cultures ( on
   [**5-15**] and [**4-14**])  correlate with being off micafungin on the floor,
   repeat cultures are negative. Lines re-changed yesterday [**4-16**]. Patient
   had prior C. glabrata line infection treated with fluconazole x23d. If
   seeded bone/heart/venous clots or abscess formation 3 week course would
   have likely been inadequate. Left thigh fluid collection previously
   drained c/w hematoma and all cultures from thigh NGTD.  She had no more
   fevers overnight but  is still very dependent on pressors. WBC still
   elevated at 23 ( has been ranging  22-26) .  So far, ascites drainage
   negative for SBP and no fungus growing to date.  She has clean eye exam
   with ophthalmology yesterday.
   .
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Continue micafungin & additional Ambisome
   - daily blood cultures for now
   - holding all TPN for now
   - new A-line and right femoral CVL re-sited [**4-16**] for fresh access / all
   old lines removed
   - [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] be done next week once more stable
   - f/u repeat glucan / galactomannan & dimorphic fungi blood cultures
   -  f/up ID recs, appreciate input
   # Leukocytosis and fever: Most likely disseminated fungal infection,
   though she came with report of C. diff infection at her rehab. Please
   see admit note for detailed ddx discussion. Thoracentesis yesterday
   showed no evidence of empyema.  WBCs still in 22-23 range but fevers
   have tapered. Still septic physiology requiring pressors
   intermittently. HD line has been removed, PICC removed.  - trending
   fevers, WBC slowly coming down
   - ID following, discuss regarding taking off antibacterials
   - Fungemia w/u and treatment as above
   - Continuing on cefepime, amikacin (to cover for resistant pseudomonas)
   but talk to ID regarding whether needs these, IV vanco and PO vanco
   given recent C.diff
   - f/up pending culture data, daily cultures
   - f/up final  CT torso read
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1163**] to r/o vegetations
   - continue CIS
   .
   #Hypoxia: Intubated mainly for airway protection vs. overt resp
   failure.   Oxygenating better today, but tachypneic on PSV, suspect
   this is fluid related or related to altered mental status.  Mental
   status improved today.
   - Trial SBT again today for 30-60min to see whether can trial
   extubation today
   -favor additional volume removal, may need CVVH. Less likely PE or
   aspiration.
   .
   # Altered mental status
   Still intubated for airway protection. The acute onset of this event
   and rapid improvement is worrisome for a seizure. With her prior CVA
   and meropenem treatment with active infection would be concerned for
   seizure. Would also consider sedating med effect eg: dilaudid, though
   she was reportedly feeling well several hours after receiving a low
   dose of PO dilaudid. No evidence of bleed on head CT. EEG with no
   active seizures.
   - wean sedation as tolerates
   -  treating infections as above
   - Consider neuro c/s
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] sepsis. Less likely cardiogenic. Her
   propofol may be contributory. She appears intravascularly volume
   overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low dose Levophed but unable
   to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed intermittently
   - Treating infection as above
   .
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - On heparin gtt
   .
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia issues
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests
   - Liver recs appreciated
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   Removed HD line as above, sending for culture. Per renal no urgent need
   for HD today. Given pressor requirement, may need CVVH. Also d/w renal
   new line options/discussion.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Follow lytes daily
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable, continue to follow daily.
   - Maintain active T+S and transfuse for hct>21

- The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (22.2-27.2 K/uL), increased creatinine levels (2.8-3.6 mg/dL), and decreased hemoglobin levels (6.8 g/dL).
- The patient has been on hemodialysis and is currently awaiting a temporary HD line placement.
- The patient's recent imaging studies include a CT torso showing no evidence of empyema and a head CT with no evidence of bleed.
- The patient's family has been informed of the current situation, and code status remains full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated fungal infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which are consistent with a disseminated fungal infection.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has recently been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis.
3. Sepsis: The patient is still septic and requires pressors intermittently.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is mainly due to airway protection, and there is a concern for fluid overload or altered mental status contributing to respiratory failure.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's acute onset of altered mental status with rapid improvement raises concern for a seizure or sedating medication effect.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is suspected to be due to sepsis, and she is on low-dose Levophed but unable to wean off completely.
7. Abdominal wound: The patient's abdominal wound is being managed with a wound vacuum but requires further evaluation and management by plastic surgery.
8. Portal venous and RIJ clots: The patient is on heparin gtt for the treatment of portal"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, recent prolonged hospital stay with abdominal
   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
   1. Candidemia:
    - all lines changed
    - cont micafungin, await sensitivies
    - holding off on tpn for now
    - will need optho exam
    - TEE [**4-18**]
   2. Leukocytosis and fevers: wbc trending up in setting of known cdif
   and candidemia, continues to have pressor requirement
    - surveillance cultures
   3. Hypoxemia: initially intubated for airway protection, tolerated
   extubation well, 2L O2 requirement but increased dyspnea with turns
    - will follow after starting CVVH
   4. Altered mental status: continues to be more lethargic than baseline
   but imrpoving, this could be related to uremia and hepatic
   encephalopathy
    - d/c fentanyl for abdominal and leg pain
    - will restart lactulose and rifaxamin
    - HD today
    - if mental status remains altered despite above interventions and
   holding sedating medications, would consider LP although meningitis
   less likely
   5. ESRD: HD line to be placed today, followed by CVVH
   6. ESLD: rifaxamin, lactulose, liver service input much appreciated,
   continuing antivirals
   7. FEN: will place post-pyloric doboff today to initiate tube feeds;
   would consider reglan if no improvement
   8. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   9. Portal vein clot: holding heparin while awaiting HD line, cont a/c
   once line has been placed
   10. Pain: diffuse and nonspecific, would start with tylenol standing,
   would restart neurontin if mental status clears

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. She has a history of abdominal wound infection, Clostridium difficile (CDIF) infection, and now has candidemia. The patient was successfully extubated and is on supplemental oxygen. She continues to require mild support with levophed. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis and fevers, hypoxemia, altered mental status, ESRD requiring hemodialysis (HD), ESLD, FEN (not specified), abdominal wound infection, portal vein clot, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has candidemia, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. Treatment includes changing all lines, continuing micafungin, awaiting sensitivities, and considering an ophthalmologic examination. There is a potential complication of disseminated candidiasis if the infection spreads to other organs.
2. Leukocytosis and fevers: The patient has an increasing white blood cell count and fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to lung complications or cardiac issues. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Altered mental status: The patient"

   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
   1. Candidemia:
    - all lines changed
    - cont micafungin, await sensitivies
    - holding off on tpn for now
    - will need optho exam
    - TEE [**4-18**]
   2. Leukocytosis and fevers: wbc trending up in setting of known cdif
   and candidemia, continues to have pressor requirement
    - surveillance cultures
   3. Hypoxemia: initially intubated for airway protection, tolerated
   extubation well, 2L O2 requirement but increased dyspnea with turns
    - will follow after starting CVVH
   4. Altered mental status: continues to be more lethargic than baseline
   but imrpoving, this could be related to uremia and hepatic
   encephalopathy
    - d/c fentanyl for abdominal and leg pain
    - will restart lactulose and rifaxamin
    - HD today
    - if mental status remains altered despite above interventions and
   holding sedating medications, would consider LP although meningitis
   less likely
   5. ESRD: HD line to be placed today, followed by CVVH
   6. ESLD: rifaxamin, lactulose, liver service input much appreciated,
   continuing antivirals
   7. FEN: will place post-pyloric doboff today to initiate tube feeds;
   would consider reglan if no improvement
   8. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   9. Portal vein clot: holding heparin while awaiting HD line, cont a/c
   once line has been placed
   10. Pain: diffuse and nonspecific, would start with tylenol standing,
   would restart neurontin if mental status clears

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has a history of abdominal wound infection, Clostridium difficile (CDif), and now candidemia. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection. The patient has been extubated successfully but still requires mild assistance with levophed. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/48 mmHg to 151/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has facial edema, scleral icterus, and a systolic murmur on cardiovascular examination. Peripheral pulses are diminished in both upper and lower extremities. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds. 

Abdominal examination shows tenderness but no rebound or guarding. There is evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. Musculoskeletal examination reveals muscle wasting, and the patient's skin is warm. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, has purposeful movements, and decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL"

   anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**2-2**] gastritis
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - hodling heparin for now
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   - follow up final CT abdomen read
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 10d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics. Will discuss whether flagyl
   required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low
   dose Levophed but unable to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and a history of prolonged hospitalization. She was readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and new candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient is currently unresponsive and intubated, with a history of similar episodes. She has multiple medical complications including anemia, hypotension, sepsis, and candidemia. She also has a history of abdominal abscess, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 24 to 19, indicating a significant drop in red blood cell count. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Close monitoring for any evidence of bleeding is recommended.
2. Candidemia: The patient has a history of candidemia, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. She has been treated with antifungal medications, and her current cultures are negative. However, there is a concern for recurrence, and further evaluation is needed.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea and colonic inflammation. Treatment includes discontinuing broad-spectrum antibiotics and initiating specific treatment for C"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**2-2**] gastritis
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - hodling heparin for now
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 10d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics. Will discuss whether flagyl
   required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low
   dose Levophed but unable to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement with subsequent abdominal abscess debridement and gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with new-onset candidemia caused by Candida albicans, unresponsive episodes, anemia, C. difficile colitis, hypotension, and ESRD on hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsive episode: The patient has experienced an unresponsive episode, which could be due to a seizure, metabolic abnormalities, infection, or primary cardiac conduction disorder. Further evaluation with EEG and neurology recommendations is needed.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly, and there is concern for a slow gastrointestinal bleed. Monitoring for any evidence of bleeding, checking hemoglobin levels frequently, and considering transfusion if necessary are important.
3. Candidemia: The patient has candidemia, likely related to lines and TPN. Cultures should be monitored, and micafungin should be continued pending fluconazole sensitivity results.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient has C. difficile colitis, and toxin assays are negative. Treatment with PO vancomycin and Flagyl for 10 days is recommended.
5. Hypotension:"

1. The patient was found unresponsive and hypotensive, requiring atropine and epinephrine for pulse generation. The patient was then intubated.

2. A CT head was performed, which showed no evidence of bleeding or acute process. Neurology was consulted, and an MRI/MRA with MRV was ordered due to concerns of possible cerebral sinus thrombosis. An EEG was also ordered.

3. The patient's EKG showed sinus rhythm with no block.

4. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed in the morning, and cardiac enzymes were drawn.

5. The patient has known allergies to antibiotics, including cefepime, ambisome, micafungin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

   CT head [**4-18**]: No acute intracranial abnormality on wet read
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans with episode of
   bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode yesterday.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**2-2**] gastritis. Unlikely to be large
   pulmonary hemorrhage
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - holding heparin for now
   - look for fluid in lung by ultrasound
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   - follow up final CT abdomen read (no overt RP bleed on wet read)
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE today or tomorrow
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement with subsequent abdominal abscess requiring debridement, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia. She has been readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and a new episode of candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness with bradycardia and hypotension, which remains uncertain in cause, possibly due to a seizure, metabolic abnormalities, infection, or primary cardiac conduction disorder.

The patient's hematocrit dropped from 24 to 19 overnight, raising concerns of a slow gastrointestinal bleed, although examination of abdominal fluid did not indicate significant bleeding. The patient has been on heparin, but it has been held due to the potential risk of bleeding. She also has candidemia, likely related to lines (PICC and old HD catheter) in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). These lines have been removed, and micafungin has been continued pending fluconazole sensitivities.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis, and toxin assays have been negative. She is being treated with vancomycin and flagyl for 14 days post-end of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Hypot"

   anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**2-2**] gastritis
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - hodling heparin for now
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   - follow up final CT abdomen read
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 10d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics. Will discuss whether flagyl
   required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. On very low
   dose Levophed but unable to wean off completely
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, on Levophed
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and new candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient's current condition includes unresponsiveness, anemia, candidemia, C. difficile colitis, hypotension, ESRD on HD, Hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, abdominal wound, portal venous and right internal jugular vein clots, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsive Episode: The patient experienced an unresponsive episode, which could be due to a seizure, metabolic abnormalities, infection, or primary cardiac conduction disorder. An EEG and further evaluation are recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 24 to 19, suggesting anemia. There is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding or slow gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any evidence of bleeding, holding heparin for now, and transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) are advised.
3. Candidemia: The patient has candidemia, which may be related to lines or TPN. Removing the lines and continuing antifungal medication are necessary. Cultures and close monitoring are also recommended.

   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, recent prolonged hospital stay with abdominal
   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
   1. Candidemia:
    - all lines changed
    - cont micafungin, await sensitivies
    - holding off on tpn for now
    - will need optho exam
    - TEE [**4-18**]
   2. Leukocytosis and fevers: wbc trending up in setting of known cdif
   and candidemia, continues to have pressor requirement
    - surveillance cultures
   3. Hypoxemia: initially intubated for airway protection, tolerated
   extubation well, 2L O2 requirement but increased dyspnea with turns
    - will follow after starting CVVH
   4. Altered mental status: continues to be more lethargic than baseline
   but imrpoving, this could be related to uremia and hepatic
   encephalopathy
    - d/c fentanyl for abdominal and leg pain
    - will restart lactulose and rifaxamin
    - HD today
    - if mental status remains altered despite above interventions and
   holding sedating medications, would consider LP although meningitis
   less likely
   5. ESRD: HD line to be placed today, followed by CVVH
   6. ESLD: rifaxamin, lactulose, liver service input much appreciated,
   continuing antivirals
   7. FEN: will place post-pyloric doboff today to initiate tube feeds;
   would consider reglan if no improvement
   8. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   9. Portal vein clot: holding heparin while awaiting HD line, cont a/c
   once line has been placed
   10. Pain: diffuse and nonspecific, would start with tylenol standing,
   would restart neurontin if mental status clears

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who has been experiencing multiple complications during her prolonged hospital stay. The patient has a history of abdominal wound infection, Clostridium difficile (CDif) infection, and now presents with candidemia.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Candidemia: All lines have been changed, and micafungin is being continued while awaiting sensitivities. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is being withheld for now, and an ophthalmology exam is needed. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been scheduled for April 18th.
2. Leukocytosis and fevers: The patient's white blood cell count is trending up in the setting of known CDif and candidemia, and she continues to require pressor support. Surveillance cultures have been ordered.
3. Hypoxemia: Initially intubated for airway protection, the patient tolerated extubation well but requires 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. Dyspnea has increased with turns, and the plan is to follow after starting continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).
4. Altered mental status: The patient is more lethargic than baseline but is improving. This could be related to uremia and hepatic encephalopathy. Fentanyl has been discontinued for abdominal and leg pain,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications. She has a history of abdominal wound infection, CDiff, and now candidemia. The patient experienced several episodes of unresponsiveness, hypotension, and hypothermia. She was reintubated due to respiratory failure and required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Imaging revealed bilateral effusions on chest X-ray, and microbiology tests indicate positive Candida albicans in the blood culture. The patient's assessment and plan involve addressing different medical conditions such as unresponsiveness, low hemoglobin, candidemia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to a seizure event. A neurology consult has been requested, and a 24-hour EEG and MRI/MRA are planned to further evaluate this possibility.
2. Acidosis: The patient's unresponsiveness could also be caused by acidosis, which is indicated by low TCO2 levels in the blood gas analysis. Prompt correction of any underlying medical conditions contributing to acidosis is necessary.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of abdominal wound infection, CDiff, and now candidemia. It is crucial to treat any active"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications. The patient recently returned to the hospital with Clostridium difficile (CDif) infection and is now diagnosed with candidemia.

The patient experienced three episodes of unresponsiveness, prompting reintubation. A neurology consult was ordered, along with a 24-hour EEG and MRI/MRA to evaluate for possible seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac event causing cerebral hypoperfusion.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels dropped significantly, leading to a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). An ultrasound-guided procedure was performed to investigate potential bleeding sites. 

The patient's lines were changed last week, and micafungin is being continued for candidemia. Fluconazole may be considered after obtaining sensitivities. The patient is also being evaluated for possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to low platelet count.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole for 14 days after antibiotics. Leukocytosis is improving.

The patient experienced respiratory failure and required reintubation. Weaning from mechanical ventilation will be considered after starting continuous"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans with episode of
   bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode yesterday.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Felt unlikely to be seizure by neurology. ?Autonomic dysfunction,
   sensitivity to BP/pain meds causing BP drop and cerebral hypoperfusion.
   - Holding on MRI, LP for now per neuro recs
   - Follow mental status with minimal sedation, wakeups
   # Anemia
   Hct now stable overnight. No gross bleeding in abdomen or in stool
   question whether she might have had some intrathoracic bleeding from HD
   line removal
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] hct today
   - maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Change to fluconazole, would complete at least 14d treatment from
   first negative blood culture after 4.15
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE today
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Continues to have significant watery stools
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   - Hold lactulose, discuss with GI
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   - consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - back on prednisone now at low dose per liver recs
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale for now
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: holding TF pending TEE

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, and autoimmune cholangiopathy. She was recently hospitalized for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and had an abdominal abscess that required debridement.
- The patient presented with candidemia and Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she was readmitted. She also experienced an episode of unresponsiveness, which was likely due to autonomic dysfunction or sensitivity to pain medications causing a drop in blood pressure and cerebral hypoperfusion.
- The patient's anemia may be related to intrathoracic bleeding from the removal of her hemodialysis line.
- She has been treated with fluconazole for candidemia, and her cultures have been negative since transfer to the ICU.
- The patient continues to have significant watery stools, indicating ongoing C. difficile colitis. She will continue to receive vancomycin and metronidazole for 14 days after stopping broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's hypotension is suspected to be due to septic etiology. She appears intravascularly volume overloaded, and her cortisol level is normal. She was able to wean off Levophed overnight.
- The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with new lines.
- She has hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and malnutrition"

   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans with episode of
   bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode yesterday.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Felt unlikely to be seizure by neurology. ?Autonomic dysfunction,
   sensitivity to BP/pain meds causing BP drop and cerebral hypoperfusion.
   - Holding on MRI, LP for now per neuro recs
   - Follow mental status with minimal sedation, wakeups
   # Anemia
   Hct now stable overnight. No gross bleeding in abdomen or in stool
   question whether she might have had some intrathoracic bleeding from HD
   line removal
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] hct today
   - maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Change to fluconazole, would complete at least 14d treatment from
   first negative blood culture after 4.15
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE today
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Continues to have significant watery stools
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   - Hold lactulose, discuss with GI
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   - consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - back on prednisone now at low dose per liver recs
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale for now
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: holding TF pending TEE

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B (HBV), and autoimmune cholangiopathy. She was readmitted with candidemia, C. difficile colitis, and a previous episode of bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/47 to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with clear lung fields on chest X-ray. She has multiple lines and drains in place, including a PICC line, femoral line, and dialysis catheter.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal blood cultures indicating Candida albicans sensitivity to fluconazole.
- The patient has ongoing medical issues including anemia, candidemia, C. difficile colitis, hypotension, ESRD on HD, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and an abdominal wound.
- The patient's care plan includes the removal of lines suspected to be the source of candidemia, treatment with fluconazole, monitoring of cultures and inflammatory markers, reexamination of thigh fluid"

   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans with episode of
   bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode yesterday.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**2-2**] gastritis. Unlikely to be large
   pulmonary hemorrhage
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - holding heparin for now
   - look for fluid in lung by ultrasound
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   - follow up final CT abdomen read (no overt RP bleed on wet read)
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE today or tomorrow
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place

   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She has been readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and new candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient experienced an unresponsive episode yesterday, which could be due to seizure, metabolic abnormalities, infection, or primary cardiac conduction disorder. Further investigations such as an MRI/MRA head with MRV and 24-hour EEG are recommended.

The patient also has anemia with a drop in hematocrit from 24 to 19 yesterday while on heparin drip. There is no evidence of gross bleeding or hemolysis, but a slow gastrointestinal bleed or other sources of bleeding need to be considered. Heparin therapy should be held, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of bleeding.

The patient's candidemia appears to be related to lines (PICC and old HD catheter) in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). These lines have been removed, and micafungin is being continued pending fluconazole sensitivities.

The patient has C. difficile colitis, but toxin assays are negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been discontinued, and vancomycin and Flagyl will be continued for an additional 14 days"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old female with fungemia-related sepsis and C. difficile infection.
- She has been admitted to the ICU due to an unresponsive episode, which was likely not a seizure.
- The patient has a history of ESRD on HD, HBV, and recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG placement.
- She has ongoing pressor dependency and is suspected to have candidemia related to lines.
- The patient also has anemia, C. difficile colitis, and hypotension, which is suspected to be septic in nature.
- She is on CVVH with new lines and requires ongoing treatment for infections.
- The patient has autoimmune cholangiopathy, hepB, and a wound that requires plastic surgery evaluation.
- There are concerns about portal venous and RIJ clots, as well as diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has ongoing candidemia, which may lead to further systemic infection if not appropriately managed.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's significant watery stools indicate ongoing C. difficile infection, which can worsen if not treated adequately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or autonomic dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed to prevent any"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of fungemia-related sepsis, C. difficile infection, and other medical conditions such as ESRD on HD, HBV, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and DM. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive with episodes of hypotension and potential autonomic dysfunction. She has ongoing pressor dependency and requires multiple medications for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to infection. The presence of multiple infections, including candidemia and C. difficile colitis, increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Organ Failure: The patient's ESRD indicates chronic kidney disease, and her liver function may be compromised due to autoimmune cholangiopathy. These conditions can lead to organ failure if not managed properly.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has had previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and right internal jugular vein thrombosis. There is a risk of further thrombotic events, especially in the context of critical illness and immobilization.
4. Infection Control: With multiple lines and tubes in place, there is a risk of healthcare-associated infections. Proper infection control measures should be implemented to minimize the risk of cath"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. 

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection that has caused systemic inflammation throughout the body. The presence of Candida albicans in blood cultures suggests a fungal infection.

2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be contributing to the sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a pre-existing chronic kidney disease, indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin concentration.

4. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a slightly alkalotic pH, low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and a respiratory rate below the set value, suggesting adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics (metronidazole, vancomycin), antifungal medication (micafungin), sedatives (propofol), vasopressor (norepinephrine), and renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure within acceptable range, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. She recently had an abdominal wound infection and was readmitted to the hospital with Clostridium difficile infection and now has candidemia. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of unresponsiveness, and her current assessment includes seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac event as differential diagnoses. She is on mechanical ventilation and has various medical complications such as coagulopathy, hypotension, respiratory failure, C. diff infection, ESRD, ESLD, and a clotting disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient's unresponsiveness could be due to a seizure, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage this condition.
2. Acidosis: The patient's low pH level indicates acidosis, which needs to be corrected promptly.
3. Infection: Given the patient's history of multiple infections, including C. diff and candidemia, it is crucial to monitor and treat any signs of infection aggressively.
4. Cardiac event: The patient's bradycardia may suggest a cardiac event causing cerebral hypoperfusion. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any cardiac issues.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PTT and low platelet count indicate coagulopathy. This needs to be corrected to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be managed, and the underlying cause should be investigated.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's reintubation indicates ongoing respiratory failure, and weaning from mechanical ventilation should be done carefully.
8. C. diff infection: The patient has a current C. diff infection, which requires treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
9. ESLD (liver failure): The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver failure, and management should involve supportive care and addressing the underlying cause.
10. FEN (feeding): The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), and nutritional support needs to be considered carefully.
11. Abdominal wound: The patient's abdominal wound requires ongoing monitoring and management, including the use of a wound vacuum.
12. Clotting disorder: The patient's clotting disorder needs to be evaluated and managed to prevent thrombotic or bleeding complications.

It is important to note that the patient's critical illness requires a multidisciplinary approach involving various specialists and close monitoring to manage these potential complications effectively."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to abdominal wound infection. She recently returned to the hospital with Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection and now presents with candidemia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was reintubated for an unresponsive episode, and her respiratory system inadequacy index (RSBI) is 800. Contributing factors include abdominal compression, increased fluid, mental status/anxiety. The plan is to follow pulmonary toilette (PT) as tolerated and assess for muscle weakness.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on low-dose pressors and is likely experiencing autonomic instability or resolving sepsis. A tuberculosis (TB) test was run, which came back negative. The patient is also on low-dose prednisone.

3. Neuro/unresponsiveness: The patient had a third episode of unresponsiveness, prompting reintubation. Differential diagnoses include seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac event given bradycardia causing cerebral hypoperfusion. An appreciation of a neuro consult is requested, along with deferring MRI/MRA and lumbar puncture (LP) due to coagulopathy.

4. Hct drop: The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) in the setting"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, recent prolonged hospital stay with abdominal
   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
   #. Respiratory failure: Reintubated for unresponsive episode. RSBI 800
   this am due to RR 50-60s. Contributing factors include abdominal
   compression, pulmonary edema/effusions, and mental status/anxiety.
   - Will follow
   - PS as tolerated
   - Check NIF to assess for muscle weakness
   #. Hypotension: On low dose pressors. Likely [**2-2**] autonomic instability
   vs resolving sepsis.
   - Run TBB negative.
   - On low dose prednisone.
   #. Neuro/unresponsiveness: Prompted reintubation. 3rd episode this
   hospitalization. DDx includes seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac
   event given bradycardia causing cerebral hypoperfusion. Unclear
   etiology, but no further episodes.
   - Appreciate neuro consult
   - Defer MRI/MRA per neuro; defer LP given coaguloapathy
   #. Hct drop: Occurred in setting of supratherapeutic PTT and
   coagulopathy. Now bumped appropriately with Hct stable.
   - Correct coagulopathy
   - Continue PPI
   - Restart heparin gtt without bolus given clotting.
   #. Candidemia:
   - All lines changed last week
   - Changed to fluconazole based on sensitivities
   - Will need optho exam
   - TEE today
   - US guided drainage of L thigh hematoma to ensure not seeded
   #. Diarrhea: Likely [**2-2**] C. diff, although not improving in setting of
   treatment.
   - PO vanc and IV flagyl, continue for 14 days after antibiotics
   - Consider more extensive work-up for diarrhea
   #. Persistent leukocytosis: Likely [**2-2**] resolving fungal infection and
   c. diff. Awaiting TEE and hematoma tap. F/u cultures.
   #. ESRD: On CVVH.
   #. ESLD:
   - On rifaxamin, lactulose (held given diarrhea)
   - Continuing antivirals; restarted prednisone.
   - Appreciate liver service input.
   #. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   #. Access: Plan for RUE PICC line placement given resolution of clot on
   most recent U/S.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, recent prolonged hospital stay, and abdominal wound infection.
- She has been readmitted to the hospital with clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection and now presents with candidemia.
- The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to reintubation due to unresponsive episode.
- She is on low-dose pressors for hypotension and has been diagnosed with candidemia.
- Neurological unresponsiveness occurred for the third time during this hospitalization, but no further episodes have been reported.
- The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels, which was corrected by bumping it appropriately.
- She has ongoing issues with coagulopathy and is at risk for bleeding.
- Diarrhea, likely caused by C. diff, is not improving despite treatment.
- Persistent leukocytosis may be due to resolving fungal infection and C. diff.
- The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for ESRD.
- ESLD (liver failure) management includes rifaximin and lactulose, antivirals, and restarted prednisone.
- Abdominal wound is being managed with wound vacuum (wound vac).
- Plans include placing a right upper extremity (RUE) PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has resulted in reintubation. Factors contributing to this include abdominal compression, pulmonary edema/effusions, and mental status/anxiety. Monitoring and managing her respiratory status will be crucial.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure. The cause of hypotension is likely autonomic instability or resolving sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting the pressor doses will be necessary.

3. Neurological Unresponsiveness: The patient has experienced three episodes of unresponsiveness, with unclear etiology. Seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac event causing cerebral hypoperfusion are potential causes. A neuro consult should be appreciated to further evaluate and manage this issue.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic PTT and coagulopathy. It is essential to correct the coagulopathy and restart heparin without a bolus given the risk of clotting.

5. Candidemia: The patient has candidemia despite changing all lines last week. Fluconazole has been changed based on sensitivities, and further steps include an ophthalmic examination and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to assess for endocarditis.

6. Diarrhea: The patient has persistent diarrhea likely due to C. diff. Treatment with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole is ongoing, but the diarrhea"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and chronic renal failure. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and dialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/40 to 126/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis can lead to further deterioration of organ function, including the kidneys, liver, and lungs. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is essential to identify any progression of sepsis.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's chronic renal failure, combined with potential sepsis and the use of nephrotoxic medications, increases the risk of developing AKI. Frequent monitoring of renal function through laboratory tests and adjustments in fluid and electroly"

   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have recurrent candidemia
   .
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement. TEE negative for any vegetations. Changed from micafungin
   to fluconazole now given recent sensitivities data.
   .
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   -can stop daily serial cultures (unless febrile)
   - Continue fluconazole, would complete at least 14d treatment from
   first negative blood culture after 4.15
 favor  4-6 weeks given
   multiple venous clots which could have been seeded
   - F/u cultures and continue to CIS
   -send off repeat glucan
   # Unresponsive episode: occurred 2 days ago, and she had similar
   episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Felt unlikely to be seizure by neurology. ?Autonomic dysfunction,
   sensitivity to BP/pain meds causing BP drop and cerebral hypoperfusion.
   - Holding on MRI, LP
   - Follow mental status with minimal sedation, wakeups
   # Anemia
   Hct now stable overnight. No gross bleeding in abdomen or in stool
   question whether she might have had some intrathoracic bleeding from HD
   line removal.  Had ~unit PRBC loss with CVVH on [**4-20**].
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] hct today
   - maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   # C diff colitis, chronic diarrhea
   Continues to have significant watery stools
 she has had extensive GI
   workup, felt to have component of pancreatic insufficiency contributing
   to chronic diarrhea. Prior stool cultures have grown AFB, probably M.
   kansasii per d/w lab though final ID pending- unclear that it is
   clinically significant
   - Would continue PO vancomycin (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for
   14d post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). -Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   - Hold lactulose
   - Will discuss AFB further with ID
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   unable to wean off Levophed overnight as still having low BP.
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   -continue attempts to wean Levophed as tolerates
   - Holding on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test at this time, complicated by current
   prednisone treatment
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with all new lines sited .
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for at least -1L as BP
   tolerates
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff  is now out   , will plan to replace today
   - back on prednisone now at low dose per liver recs
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - continue heparin with close followup of PTTs
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale for now
   .
   # Access:  complicated given recent fungemia, multiple clots
   - will consider temporary IJ vs. subclavian today so can pull femoral
   line
   - will hold off on PICC option for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG, abdominal abscess requiring debridement, gram-negative bacteremia, candidemia, readmitted with C.difficile colitis, and recurrent candidemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is sedated, unable to provide history. She has multiple medical complications including candidemia, unresponsive episodes, anemia, C.difficile colitis, hypotension, ESRD on HD, HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy, abdominal wound, portal venous and RIJ clots, and DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has recurrent candidemia, which can lead to systemic fungal infection and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Unresponsive episodes: The patient has experienced episodes of unresponsiveness, which may be due to seizures, autonomic dysfunction, or sensitivity to BP/pain medications causing cerebral hypoperfusion.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable Hct overnight, but there is a possibility of intrathoracic bleeding from HD line removal. Close monitoring and blood transfusion may be required.
4. C.difficile colitis: The patient has ongoing significant watery stools indicating chronic diarrhea, which may be due to C.difficile colitis. Treatment with vancomycin and flagyl for 14 days is recommended.

   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have recurrent candidemia
   .
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Continue fluconazole, would complete at least 14d treatment from
   first negative blood culture after 4.15
 favor  4-6 weeks given
   multiple venous clots which could have been seeded
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   # Unresponsive episode: occurred 2 days ago, and she had similar
   episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Felt unlikely to be seizure by neurology. ?Autonomic dysfunction,
   sensitivity to BP/pain meds causing BP drop and cerebral hypoperfusion.
   - Holding on MRI, LP
   - Follow mental status with minimal sedation, wakeups
   # Anemia
   Hct now stable overnight. No gross bleeding in abdomen or in stool
   question whether she might have had some intrathoracic bleeding from HD
   line removal.  Had ~unit PRBC loss with CVVH on [**4-20**].
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] hct today
   - maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   # C diff colitis, chronic diarrhea
   Continues to have significant watery stools
 she has had extensive GI
   workup, felt to have component of pancreatic insufficiency contributing
   to chronic diarrhea. Prior stool cultures have grown AFB, probably M.
   kansasii per d/w lab though final ID pending- unclear that it is
   clinically significant
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**4-1**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**4-5**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-17**]). -Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   - Hold lactulose
   - Will discuss AFB further with ID
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**2-2**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight.
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   - Holding on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test at this time, complicated by current
   prednisone treatment
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for at least -1L as BP
   tolerates
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff  in place
   - back on prednisone now at low dose per liver recs
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hepatitis B (HBV), and autoimmune cholangiopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications.

The current summary of the patient's health progress includes:
1. Candidemia: The patient had candidemia, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. This infection is suspected to be related to lines (PICC and old HD catheter) in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The lines have been removed, and the patient is being treated with fluconazole. It is recommended to continue fluconazole for at least 14 days from the first negative blood culture and consider a total treatment duration of 4-6 weeks given multiple venous clots which could have been seeded.
2. Unresponsive episode: The patient experienced an unresponsive episode two days ago, which was similar to an episode she had on the floor prompting her transfer to the ICU. It was felt unlikely to be a seizure by neurology. The cause may be autonomic dysfunction, sensitivity to BP/pain meds causing BP drop and cerebral hypoperfusion. An MRI and LP were withheld, and the patient's mental status is being followed with minimal sedation and wakeups.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now stable overnight."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hepatitis B, autoimmune cholangiopathy, and a history of prolonged hospitalization for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She was admitted with abdominal abscess and gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia, and now presents with new-onset candidemia caused by Candida albicans. The patient experienced an unresponsive episode that may be related to autonomic dysfunction or sensitivity to blood pressure/pain medications, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion. She also has anemia, suspected to be due to intrathoracic bleeding from the hemodialysis (HD) line removal and blood loss during continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Additionally, the patient has C. difficile colitis, hypotension possibly secondary to sepsis, and ongoing pressor dependency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has a new-onset candidemia caused by Candida albicans. This condition requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient continues to have significant watery stools indicating ongoing C. difficile infection. Appropriate treatment should be initiated to manage this condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis secondary to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring and treatment of the underlying infection are crucial in managing this"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hepatitis B (HBV), and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was admitted with abdominal abscess requiring debridement, gram-negative bacteremia, and candidemia. She now presents with candidemia, unresponsive episodes, anemia, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) colitis, chronic diarrhea, hypotension, and ESRD on hemodialysis (HD). The patient has multiple comorbidities including autoimmune cholangiopathy, diabetes mellitus (DM), portal venous and right internal jugular (RIJ) clots, and abdominal wound infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has ongoing candidemia due to suspected line-related infections. Antifungal treatment with fluconazole has been initiated, and cultures are being monitored. The patient's lines have been removed, and further management is planned based on the results of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and follow-up cultures.

2. Unresponsive Episode: The patient experienced an unresponsive episode two days ago, which could be due to autonomic dysfunction, sensitivity to blood pressure/pain medications causing blood pressure drops and cerebral hypoperfusion. An MRI is being withheld for now, and a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered as per neurology recommendations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She has been readmitted with Clostridium difficile colitis and recurrent candidemia. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history.

24-hour events:
- Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no evidence of endocarditis or paravalvular vegetations, normal right ventricle (RV), and mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
- An interventional radiology (IR)-guided aspiration of a thigh collection revealed a small hematoma, and fluid sent for cultures.
- Due to difficulty accessing the right peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC), a left femoral line was placed as a temporary access option.
- The Dopamine infusion was discontinued overnight and needs to be replaced in the morning.

Medications:
- Micafungin was last administered on 04/19/2016 at 08:00 PM.
- Vancomycin was last administered on 04/20/2016 at 12:00 AM.
- Fluconazole was last administered on 04/20/2016 at 10:10 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, recent prolonged hospital stay with abdominal
   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
    #. Respiratory failure: Reintubated for unresponsive episode. RSBI 800
   this am due to RR 50-60s. Contributing factors include abdominal
   compression, pulmonary edema/effusions, and mental status/anxiety.
   - Will follow
   - PS as tolerated
   - Check NIF to assess for muscle weakness
   #. Hypotension: On low dose pressors. Likely [**2-2**] autonomic instability
   vs resolving sepsis.
   - Run TBB negative.
   - On low dose prednisone.
   #. Neuro/unresponsiveness: Prompted reintubation. 3rd episode this
   hospitalization. DDx includes seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac
   event given bradycardia causing cerebral hypoperfusion. Unclear
   etiology, but no further episodes.
   - Appreciate neuro consult
   - Defer MRI/MRA per neuro; defer LP given coaguloapathy
   #. Hct drop: Occurred in setting of supratherapeutic PTT and
   coagulopathy. Now bumped appropriately with Hct stable.
   - Correct coagulopathy
   - Continue PPI
   - Restart heparin gtt without bolus given clotting.
   #. Candidemia:
   - All lines changed last week
   - Changed to fluconazole based on sensitivities
   - Will need optho exam
   - TEE today
   - US guided drainage of L thigh hematoma to ensure not seeded
   #. Diarrhea: Likely [**2-2**] C. diff, although not improving in setting of
   treatment.
   - PO vanc and IV flagyl, continue for 14 days after antibiotics
   - Consider more extensive work-up for diarrhea
   #. Persistent leukocytosis: Likely [**2-2**] resolving fungal infection and
   c. diff. Awaiting TEE and hematoma tap. F/u cultures.
   #. ESRD: On CVVH.
   #. ESLD:
   - On rifaxamin, lactulose (held given diarrhea)
   - Continuing antivirals; restarted prednisone.
   - Appreciate liver service input.
   #. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   #. Access: Plan for RUE PICC line placement given resolution of clot on
   most recent U/S.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently in the ICU.

Summary of Information:
- The patient has a history of abdominal wound infection, CDiff (Clostridium difficile), and now candidemia.
- She experienced respiratory failure and required reintubation due to unresponsive episodes, with contributing factors such as abdominal compression, pulmonary edema/effusions, and mental status/anxiety.
- The patient is on low-dose pressors for hypotension, likely due to autonomic instability or resolving sepsis.
- She had an episode of neuro/unresponsiveness, prompting reintubation. Possible causes include seizure, acidosis, infection, or cardiac event causing cerebral hypoperfusion.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped due to a supratherapeutic PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and coagulopathy, which has since been corrected.
- She has candidemia, with all lines changed last week, switched to fluconazole based on sensitivities, and an upcoming ophthalmic examination and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to guide management.
- The patient is experiencing diarrhea, likely due to Clostridium difficile, although not improving with treatment.
- There is persistent leukocytosis, likely resolving fungal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and has had multiple complications including abdominal wound infection, clostridium difficile infection (CDif), and candidemia.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, neuro/unresponsiveness, candidemia, diarrhea, persistent leukocytosis, ESRD, clotting disorder, and ESLD (liver disease).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxia and potential need for mechanical ventilation. Hypotension may lead to organ perfusion issues and potential shock. Neuro/unresponsiveness could be indicative of a neurological event such as a stroke or seizures. Candidemia and diarrhea could progress to sepsis or disseminated infection. Persistent leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response. ESRD and ESLD are chronic conditions requiring ongoing management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially in relation to any changes in respiratory function or hypotension. Regular assessment of neurological status is also crucial. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for candidemia and CDif, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further infections. Management of the patient's dialysis needs and nutritional support should be addressed. Close collaboration with various specialists such as neurology, infectious diseases, and liver services may be required for"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, recent prolonged hospital stay with abdominal
   wound infection, returned to [**Hospital1 1**] with CDif and now with candidemia
    #. Respiratory failure: Reintubated for unresponsive episode. RSBI 87
   this am; passed SBT. Mental status good
 awake and following commands.
   - Extubate this am.
   #. Hypotension: On low dose pressors. Likely [**2-2**] autonomic instability
   vs resolving sepsis.
   - Run TBB negative.
   - On low dose prednisone.
   - Try to wean off pressors once extubated and off sedation.
   #. Neuro/unresponsiveness: Prompted reintubation. 3rd episode this
   hospitalization. Unclear etiology, but no further episodes. Mental
   status improved now.
   - Appreciate neuro consult
   - Defer MRI/MRA per neuro; defer LP given coaguloapathy
   #. Candidemia:
   - All lines changed last week
   - Changed to fluconazole based on sensitivities
   - Will need optho exam
   #. Diarrhea: Likely [**2-2**] C. diff, although not improving in setting of
   treatment.
   - PO vanc and IV flagyl, continue for 14 days after antibiotics
   #. Persistent leukocytosis: Likely [**2-2**] resolving fungal infection and
   c. diff. TEE and L thigh hematoma tap unremarkable. F/u cultures.
   #. ESRD: On CVVH.
   #. Clotting: On heparin gtt
   #. ESLD:
   - On rifaxamin, lactulose (held given diarrhea)
   - Continuing antivirals; restarted prednisone.
   - Appreciate liver service input.
   #. Abdominal wound: wound vac changed last week, appreciate plastic
   surgery assistance
   #. Access: Readdress PICC with team given need to remove femoral line.
   #. FEN: Assess ability to swallow when extubated. [**Month (only) 11**] need Dobhoff
   replaced.
   #. GOC: Family meeting today after patient extubated and can
   contribute.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. She has a history of abdominal wound infection, and recently returned to the hospital with Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection and now presents with candidemia.

The patient has been reintubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on low-dose pressors for hypotension, which may be attributed to autonomic instability or resolving sepsis. She experienced an unresponsive episode that prompted reintubation, and her mental status has improved since then. A neuro consult has been deferred, and an MRI/MRA is not recommended at this time.

The patient's lines have been changed, and she has been switched to fluconazole for the treatment of candidemia. An ophthalmology exam is needed to assess for any potential complications related to candidemia. The patient also has diarrhea, which is likely caused by C. diff. Despite treatment, there has been no improvement. She is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole for a total of 14 days after antibiotics.

The patient's leukocytosis is likely resolving due to the fungal infection and C. diff. A thigh hematoma tap did not reveal any organisms. She is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is on heparin sodium gtt for clotting. Her liver enzymes are elevated,"
