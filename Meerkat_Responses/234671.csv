","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) since 3/8, then peritoneal dialysis (PD) since 9/10, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis who presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with nausea/vomiting and fevers. The patient was admitted with bacterial peritonitis and started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for infection treatment. He is also on peritoneal dialysis as recommended by renal guidelines.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea/vomiting, and paracentesis consistent with bacterial peritonitis. He has been started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for treatment of the infection.
2. Hypoxemia: Initially thought to be fluid overload, but chest X-ray showed no signs of increased infiltrates. The patient likely has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to tobacco use, which is causing wheezing on examination.
3. ESRD on PD: The patient is on peritoneal dialysis and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new onset abdominal pain, associated with nausea, vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted with bacterial peritonitis and started on vancomycin and cefazemine for treatment. His renal function is being monitored, and he will continue with PD as per renal recommendations. The patient meets sepsis protocol criteria but has an elevated central venous pressure (CVP). Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required. He is also being treated for hypoxemia, likely secondary to COPD, and ESRD on PD. Other medical conditions include hypertension, diabetes, chronic back pain, depression, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has symptoms consistent with bacterial peritonitis, meets sepsis protocol criteria, and has an elevated CVP. There is a potential risk of progression to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given the patient's history of ESRD on PD, there is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after paracentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for the infection. His condition is monitored closely for any clinical changes, and adjustments to his treatment plan are made as necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient has a diagnosis of bacterial peritonitis, which is an infection of the peritoneum. This condition can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: Due to the presence of bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and signs of infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which is a life-threatening response by the body to infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and previous MSSA peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after paracentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis. The patient has been started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for treatment of the infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, fevers, and nausea/vomiting, along with the positive gram stain and cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood, indicate bacterial peritonitis. This condition can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 yo M with ESRD on HD since [**3-8**] then PD since [**9-10**], DM2,
   HTN, diastolic CHF, and h/o MSSA peritonitis in [**6-11**], who presented to
   ED with new onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with
   nausea/vomiting and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after
   parcentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis.
   # Bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia and septic shock:  Patient
   presents with symptoms on abdominal pain, fevers, N/V and paracentesis
   consistent with bacterial peritonitis.  He was originally started on
   Vanco/Ceftazidime for treatment of infection.  Gram stain and
   preliminary cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood show gram positive
   cocci in pairs and chains. Lactate is rising. Renal aware and is
   following.
   - Closely monitor exam for signs of clinical change.
   - 3pm lactate, CPK, and CBC with manual diff.
   - F/u renal and ID recs.
   - Vanc trough 12.5 this AM. Continue Vanco 1gm daily in HD fluid for
   now. Consider changing to ceftazolin if it comes back as sensitive.
   - Re-check vanco level tomorrow AM (and subsequent 1-2 days); dose
   vanco accordingly.
   - D/c ceftazidime.
   - No need to start daptomyacin or linezolid given that micro gave
   preliminary opinion that organism looks like beta-strep and not like
   enterococcus.
   - f/u peritoneal dialysis
   - Monitor blood pressure and CVP closely. Consider adjusting PD for
   fluid balance or using levophed if necessary.
   - Morphine 2-4mg IV q6h PRN abdominal pain.
   # Hypoxemia:  Initially thought to be [**2-5**] fluid overload s/p 1L NS
   bolus, however, CXR showed no signs of increased infiltrates. Likely
   from COPD given + tobacco use.
   - albuterol PRN wheezing.
   - Cont O2 supplementation, wean as tolerated.
   # ESRD on PD :
   - 6 cycles PD per day with alternating 4.25% and 2.5%, 2.5L volume.
   - Heparin with PD.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - cont home Renagel, Calcitriol, Sensipar.
   # HTN: controlled on PD. BPs have been dipping low today, with PD.
   # DM:  No antihyperglycemic agents on med list.  Diet-controlled?
   - cont Gabapentin, ASA
   - Finger stick blood glucose QID
   - ISS
   # Chronic Back pain:
   - cont home methadone
   - hold home oxycodone, start Morphine IV PRN pain
   # Depression:
   - Cont home Mirtazapine, paroxetine
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Cont home lipitor
   # FEN:
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and replete when necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. Paracentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis, and he was admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia and septic shock. He is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime, but the gram stain and preliminary cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood show gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The lactate level is rising, indicating possible worsening of his condition. The patient's renal function is aware, and he is following it.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock due to bacterial peritonitis. If not managed promptly and effectively, there is a risk of further deterioration in his hemodynamic status and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has hypoxemia, likely due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as oxygen supplementation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after paracentesis was suspicious for bacterial peritonitis. He has been treated with vancomycin (Vanco) and ceftazidime, but ceftazidime was discontinued. The patient's abdominal pain has significantly improved. His renal function is being monitored. The plan includes continuing peritoneal dialysis every six hours with 4.25% dialysate, following up on sensitivities from 08/16 and blood cultures from 08/17, sending PD fluid cell count and culture, administering Vanco 2 gm daily in PD fluid for six hours starting tomorrow, rechecking Vanco level tomorrow morning, and discontinuing the central line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with bacterial peritonitis. He is being treated with antibiotics, but further monitoring and evaluation of sensitivities and cultures are needed.

   This is a 58 yo M with ESRD on HD since [**3-8**] then PD since [**9-10**], DM2,
   HTN, diastolic CHF, and h/o MSSA peritonitis in [**6-11**], who presented to
   ED with new onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with
   nausea/vomiting and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after
   parcentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis.
   # Bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia and septic shock:  Patient
   presents with symptoms on abdominal pain, fevers, N/V and paracentesis
   consistent with bacterial peritonitis.  He was originally started on
   Vanco/Ceftazidime for treatment of infection.  Gram stain and
   preliminary cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood show gram positive
   cocci in pairs and chains. Speciation on [**2191-8-18**] is group B
   Streptococci. Renal is following.
   - Closely monitor exam for signs of clinical change.
   - 3pm lactate, CPK, and CBC with manual diff.
   - F/u renal and ID recs.
   - Vanc trough 12.5 this AM. Continue Vanco 1gm daily in HD fluid for
   now. Consider changing to ceftazolin if it comes back as sensitive.
   - Re-check vanco level tomorrow AM (and subsequent 1-2 days); dose
   vanco accordingly.
   - D/c ceftazidime.
   - No need to start daptomyacin or linezolid given that micro gave
   preliminary opinion that organism looks like beta-strep and not like
   enterococcus.
   - f/u peritoneal dialysis
   - Monitor blood pressure and CVP closely. Consider adjusting PD for
   fluid balance or using levophed if necessary.
   - Morphine 2-4mg IV q6h PRN abdominal pain.
   # Hypoxemia:  Initially thought to be [**2-5**] fluid overload s/p 1L NS
   bolus, however, CXR showed no signs of increased infiltrates. Likely
   from COPD given + tobacco use.
   - albuterol PRN wheezing.
   - Cont O2 supplementation, wean as tolerated.
   # ESRD on PD :
   - 6 cycles PD per day with alternating 4.25% and 2.5%, 2.5L volume.
   - Heparin with PD.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - cont home Renagel, Calcitriol, Sensipar.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with nausea/vomiting and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after paracentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis.

The patient's current conditions include bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia and septic shock. The initial treatment included Vancomycin and ceftazidime, but subsequent cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, speciated as group B Streptococcus. Renal function is being closely monitored.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid balance or use of vasopressors may be necessary.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, likely due to underlying COPD and tobacco use. Oxygen supplementation and weaning as tolerated are recommended.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has imbalances in potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after a paracentesis was suspicious for bacterial peritonitis. The patient's abdominal pain has significantly improved since starting treatment with vancomycin and ceftazidime. However, the ceftazidime was discontinued due to an elevated creatinine level. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, morphine for abdominal pain, albuterol for wheezing, and various other medications for his chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression, and chronic back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to low vascular tone in the setting of sepsis and challenges of fluid balance with PD treatments. It is important to monitor blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) closely and consider adjusting PD for fluid balance or using levophed if necessary.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had hypoxemia, which was initially"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 yo M with ESRD on HD since [**3-8**] then PD since [**9-10**], DM2,
   HTN, diastolic CHF, and h/o MSSA peritonitis in [**6-11**], who presented to
   ED with new onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with
   nausea/vomiting and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after
   parcentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis.
   # Bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia and septic shock:  Patient
   presents with symptoms on abdominal pain, fevers, N/V and paracentesis
   consistent with bacterial peritonitis.  He was originally started on
   Vanco/Ceftazidime for treatment of infection.  Gram stain and
   preliminary cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood show gram positive
   cocci in pairs and chains. Speciation on [**2191-8-18**] is group B
   Streptococci. Renal is following.
   - Closely monitor exam for signs of clinical change.
   - 3pm lactate, CPK, and CBC with manual diff.
   - F/u renal and ID recs.
   - Vanc trough 12.5 this AM. Continue Vanco 1gm daily in HD fluid for
   now. Consider changing to ceftazolin if it comes back as sensitive.
   - Re-check vanco level tomorrow AM (and subsequent 1-2 days); dose
   vanco accordingly.
   - D/c ceftazidime.
   - No need to start daptomyacin or linezolid given that micro gave
   preliminary opinion that organism looks like beta-strep and not like
   enterococcus.
   - f/u peritoneal dialysis
   - Monitor blood pressure and CVP closely. Consider adjusting PD for
   fluid balance or using levophed if necessary.
   - Morphine 2-4mg IV q6h PRN abdominal pain.
   # Hypoxemia:  Initially thought to be [**2-5**] fluid overload s/p 1L NS
   bolus, however, CXR showed no signs of increased infiltrates. Likely
   from COPD given + tobacco use.
   - albuterol PRN wheezing.
   - Cont O2 supplementation, wean as tolerated.
   # ESRD on PD :
   - 6 cycles PD per day with alternating 4.25% and 2.5%, 2.5L volume.
   - Heparin with PD.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - cont home Renagel, Calcitriol, Sensipar.
   # HTN: controlled on PD. BPs have been dipping low today, with PD.
   # DM:  No antihyperglycemic agents on med list.  Diet-controlled?
   - cont Gabapentin, ASA

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) since March 8th, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a previous episode of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis. He presented to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after paracentesis revealed bacterial peritonitis.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and ceftazidime for the treatment of infection, but the preliminary cultures from peritoneal fluid and blood show gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, speciation on 08/18/2191 is group B Streptococci. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the risk of worsening hypoxemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) should be closely monitored, and adjustments to fluid balance or the use of vasopressors like levophed may be necessary.
3. Infection: Despite the change in antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing infection, especially with the presence of group B Streptococci.
4. Fluid overload:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 yo M with ESRD on HD since [**3-8**] then PD since [**9-10**], DM2,
   HTN, diastolic CHF, and h/o MSSA peritonitis in [**6-11**], who presented to
   ED with new onset abdominal pain since this morning, associated with
   nausea/vomiting and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after
   parcentesis was suspicious for bacterial peritonitis.
   # Bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia:  Patient presents with
   symptoms on abdominal pain, fevers, N/V and paracentesis consistent
   with bacterial peritonitis.  He was originally started on
   Vanco/Ceftazidime for treatment of infection.  Gram stain and cultures
   from group B strep in pairs and chains. Sensitivities not yet
   available. Abdominal pain significantly improved. Renal is following.
   - Pull peritoneal dialysis catheter because of risk of GBS biofilms?
   Versus continue peritoneal dialysis today.
   - Closely monitor exam for signs of clinical change.
   - 3pm lactate, CPK, and CBC.
   - F/u renal and ID recs.
   - Vanc trough 23.5 this AM. Vanco .5gm daily in HD fluid for now.
   Consider changing to ceftazolin if it comes back as sensitive.
   - Re-check vanco level tomorrow AM (and subsequent 1-2 days); dose
   vanco accordingly.
   - No need to treat with daptomyacin or linezolid given that there
s no
   evidence of enterococcus.
   - Morphine 2-4mg IV q6h PRN abdominal pain.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to low vascular tone in the setting of
   sepsis, and challenges of fluid balance with PD treatments. Has
   maintained SBP above 90 without pressors or fluid bolus.
   - Monitor blood pressure and CVP closely. Consider adjusting PD for
   fluid balance or using levophed if necessary.
   # Hypoxemia:  Initially thought to be [**2-5**] fluid overload s/p 1L NS
   bolus, however, CXR showed no signs of increased infiltrates. Likely
   from COPD given + tobacco use. Slight expiratory wheezes, which he
   received albuterol for yesterday. On 5L by NC with good oxygenation
   (98%).
   - Continue albuterol PRN wheezing.
   - Cont O2 supplementation, wean as tolerated.
   # ESRD on PD :
   - 12 cycles PD per day with 2.5%, 2.5L volume.
   - Heparin with PD.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - cont home Renagel, Calcitriol, Sensipar.
   # h/o HTN: controlled on PD. BPs have been dipping low today, with PD.
   # DM:  No antihyperglycemic agents on home med list.  Diet-controlled?
   - cont Gabapentin, ASA
   - Finger stick blood glucose QID
   - ISS
   # Chronic Back pain:
   - cont home methadone
   - hold home oxycodone, start Morphine IV PRN pain
   # Depression:
   - Cont home Mirtazapine, paroxetine
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Cont home lipitor
   # FEN: K+ and Ca+ repleted overnight.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and replete when necessary.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) peritonitis.
- He presented to the emergency department with new onset abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers. He was admitted to the ICU after a paracentesis was suspicious for bacterial peritonitis.
- The patient has been treated with vancomycin (Vanco) and ceftazidime for the infection. His abdominal pain has significantly improved.
- The patient's renal function is being closely monitored.
- There are concerns about the risk of biofilms on the peritoneal dialysis catheter, which may require removal. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored.
- The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia are also being managed. Hypotension is likely due to low vascular tone in sepsis and challenges with fluid balance during PD treatments. Hypoxemia is likely from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbated by smoking.
