   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory
   distress, CT head negative, toxic metabolic work-up unrevealing.  Will
   hold off on any further work up at this time.
   -Wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate and evaluate her
   mental status
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Unclear etiology, the patient has HTN at
   baseline on a multiple drug regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   .
   #. Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   .
   #. Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   .
   #. ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is currently showing signs of coffee ground emesis with guiac negative stools. Other medical issues include type II diabetes and ESRD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and recent episode of hypoxic respiratory distress indicate a potential ongoing respiratory problem. The presence of coarse ventilated breath sounds suggests possible airway obstruction or lung pathology.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory distress, which may have caused her altered mental status. Further evaluation is needed once her sedation is weaned.
3. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's hypertension at baseline on multiple drug regimens raises concerns about uncontrolled blood pressure. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are necessary.
4. Mixed acid/base disorder: The ABG results indicate a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. The underlying cause needs to be addressed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 4003] is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, which could be causing her current respiratory distress. This is supported by the absence of a cuff leak during examination. The recent restart of valsartan may have contributed to angioedema. ABG results show underlying respiratory acidosis, indicating potential airway obstruction prior to acute hypoxia. Current ventilator settings include FiO2 at 50% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O.

Plan:
- Continue intubation for respiratory support.
- Adjust FiO2 to 40% and tolerate slightly elevated pCO2 to correct pH.
- Administer Decadron 10mg IV every 8 hours.
- Consider involving internal medicine (IM) or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists for bronchoscopic assistance during extubation.
- Hold valsartan and discuss the plan with [First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449] [Last Name (NamePattern1)].

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Continue intubation for respiratory support, would come down on FiO2
   to 40%, and tolerate slightly elevated pCO2 to fix her pH
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H
   -Consider involving IP vs ENT, may need bronchoscopic assistance during
   extubation
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory
   distress, CT head negative, toxic metabolic work-up unrevealing.  Will
   hold off on any further work up at this time.
   -Wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate and evaluate her
   mental status
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Unclear etiology, the patient has HTN at
   baseline on a multiple drug regimen
   -Weaned off of labetalol gtt overnight with SBP 120-130, can
   re-introduce PO labetalol and titrate as needed once she becomes more
   hypertensive
   .
   #. Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   .
   #. Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a pH of 7.46, pCO2 of 44, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 440. She is also receiving decadron and has been placed on a medical hold for valsartan. Her altered mental status is likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory distress, and further workup has been withheld at this time. The patient has a history of hypertension and is being weaned off labetalol. She has a mixed acid/base disorder, possibly due to a contraction alkalosis or renin-mediated process. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected based on coffee ground emesis and a history of UGIBs. The patient is also on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease and has type II diabetes mellitus. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will require a nutrition consult for tube feeds."

   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She presented with unresponsiveness after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has a history of repeated intubations, and a CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism or any other acute process. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) reflects an underlying respiratory acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and recent episode of hypoxic respiratory distress may lead to further respiratory complications. The possibility of angioedema from ACE inhibitors or history of multiple intubations should be considered. A tracheostomy is recommended to relieve airway obstruction and prevent further respiratory distress.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require adjustment of medication due to the recent episode of hypotensive crisis. Labetalol PO will be restarted, and the infusion will be weaned as tolerated.

3. Mixed acid/base disorder: The ABG results indicate a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. The underlying cause could be a contraction alkalosis or a renin-mediated process. Correction of bicarbonate and chloride levels is necessary, considering the patient's dry appearance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She presented unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 to 180/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, hypertension, a mixed acid-base disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and end-stage renal disease. She is currently receiving various medications such as famotidine, heparin sodium, hydralazine, and labetalol. The patient has undergone several interventions including placement of a dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and recent episode of hypoxic respiratory distress may indicate a potential for recurrent episodes of respiratory compromise. A tracheostomy is being considered to relieve the stenosis and improve"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. The patient was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, which can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory distress. The recent episode of hypoxic respiratory distress further suggests the possibility of angioedema or recurrent laryngeal edema. Immediate intervention such as tracheostomy may be necessary to secure the airway.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is not well-controlled as indicated by the blood pressure readings. Labetalol has been restarted orally, and the dose is being weaned as tolerated.

3. Mixed acid/base disorder: The ABG results indicate a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. This could be due to compensation for an underlying condition or respiratory distress. Correcting the underlying alkalosis before optimizing respiratory acidosis is essential.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by coffee ground emesis and negative guiac stools. This may require further investigation and management to prevent further bleeding.

5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has E"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient's family has agreed to a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, with plans to proceed to the operating room this afternoon. The patient received Vancomycin and Desmopressin pre-procedure. Overnight, the patient experienced hypertension, which improved after administration of Labetolol 200mg PO and Hydralazine 20mg IV. The dose of Labetolol was increased to 400mg TID. Renal recommendations indicate that the patient should be dialyzed prior to the procedure today. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated overnight and required medication intervention with Labetolol and Hydralazine. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to manage and control hypertension.

2. Renal issues: The patient's renal function should be assessed, and considering the renal recommendations, dialysis may be required prior to the procedure. Monitoring kidney function and appropriate fluid management are crucial.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory distress, which necessitated ICU admission. Monitoring of respiratory parameters such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate is essential. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be required based on the patient's condition.

4. Infection: The patient has pending urine and blood cultures. Infections could pose a significant risk"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**], a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and requires surgical intervention for laryngeal stricture. She will continue mechanical ventilation and is on call for an OR procedure today. The family has consented to the procedure. If a tracheostomy is performed, sedation may be adjusted using versed/fentanyl.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture, hypertension, mixed acid/base disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleed, end-stage renal disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. She is currently undergoing hemodialysis and will continue on a regular schedule.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture: Surgical intervention is necessary to address the patient's laryngeal stricture. Complications associated with this procedure could include bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures, or failure to improve airway patency.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being managed with multiple medications. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
3. Mixed acid/base disorder: The patient's acid/base imbalance indicates a disturbance in the body's pH balance. If left"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, presented with unresponsiveness following an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress.
- The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to subglottic laryngeal edema, which may be secondary to angioedema from ACE inhibitors or a history of multiple intubations.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism or any other acute process.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reflects an underlying respiratory acidosis, indicating potential airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.
- The patient is currently on assisted control ventilation (AC) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5.
- A tracheostomy is planned to address the patient's repeated intubations and alleviate upper airway obstruction.
- Decadron 10mg IV q8H has been prescribed for three days to manage the edema.
- Valsartan has been held due to concerns about angioedema.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol PO and weaning of the IV infusion.
- The patient has a mixed acid/base disorder, with both metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4003], a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and requires surgical intervention for respiratory distress and laryngeal stricture. Her blood pressure is being managed with multiple drugs, and she has a history of mixed acid/base disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture: The patient's respiratory distress and laryngeal stricture require surgical intervention. If the procedure does not go as planned or if there are complications during recovery, it could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential failure to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with multiple drugs. If the current management plan is not effective, the blood pressure may not be adequately controlled, leading to potential complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Mixed acid/base disorder: The patient has a mixed acid/base disorder, which indicates an imbalance in the acid-base levels in her body. If not properly managed, this can lead to respiratory and metabolic complications.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in significant blood loss and shock"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F ESRD, DM, HTN, subglottic edema due to ?
   intubations vs angioedema. Developed SOB at rehab after resuming
   valsartan. Found unresponsive at rehab with hypoxia and brought to the
   ED and intubated with difficulty given swelling. Imaging unremarkable,
   R fem CVL placed, treated with abx, and sent to MICU. Getting HD,
   awaiting T+G in OR today.
   Sedation changed from Propafol to versed, fentanyl. Reglan started for
   residuals. Had some pauses on vent and switched back to AC
   Exam notable for Tm 98.1 BP 100-40/30-70 HR 70s RR 11-15 with sat 99%
   on AC 450x10, 40% PEEP 5. 7.41/46/221
   Sedated, comfortable on vent. Chest clear, RRR S1S2S4 [**5-16**] SM at apex,
   soft abd, stasis changes, audible flow murmur over L arm. Labs notable
   for WBC 8.8K, HCT 29.7% Plt 213, K+ 5.5. NA 139, Cl 99 BUN 22 Cr 4.9
   Meds: NPH SSRI Famotidine SC Hep Chlor hex Clonidine Labetalol Fent 75
   Midaz 4 Free Water Reglan Nephrocaps
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care.
   Resp: Lighten sedation to allow for PSV.  Plan for T+G by IP in OR
   Monday. Continue to monitor for s/sx of aspiration PNA, check sputum cx
   and hold abx for now
   Hemodynamics: Will try to optimize BP control with IV / PO labetalol
   and addition of clonidine patch.
   Will monitor HCT closely given ?UGIB, continue H2B, currently stable
   without evidence of blood loss. Will hold off on long term
   anticoagulation for UEDVT per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**], HD per renal team.
   Hope tp plan for either PICC PIV or only HD line after OR to remove
   femoral line
   Monitor FSG and continue RISS.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 40 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient has a planned surgical intervention for laryngeal stricture, hypertension at baseline on multiple medications, a mixed acid/base disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and end-stage renal disease. She also has type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture: The patient may experience further respiratory difficulties due to the laryngeal stricture, which may require surgical intervention.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is on multiple medications. There is a risk of uncontrolled blood pressure, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Mixed acid/base disorder: The patient has an imbalance in acid and base levels in her blood. If not properly managed, this can lead to respiratory and metabolic complications.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: Although the patient's upper gastrointestinal bleed appears stable at the moment, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or development of new ulcers, leading to further bleeding.
5. End-stage renal disease: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, and she requires dialysis. Complications related to renal failure, such as fluid overload or electrolyte"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 144/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated with midazolam (versed) and fentanyl, and is receiving tube feeds through a feeding tube. 

The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergens. He is currently receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,204 mL and a total output of 3,551 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,347 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous fluids and has a urinary output of 11 mL. 

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 20. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient being intubated. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels, with otherwise stable results.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, lines management, dialysis catheter placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fluid imbalance."

The patient has a femoral line and a tunneled dialysis catheter, raising concerns of a potential line infection. There are also concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but this seems less likely given the clear chest X-ray.

The patient requires a tracheostomy due to laryngeal stricture and ongoing respiratory distress. Her blood pressure has been well controlled without the use of gtt labetalol. She has end-stage renal disease and requires dialysis three times a week. Her diabetes is well controlled with NPH insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: Given the presence of a femoral line and the patient's fever and leukocytosis, there is a concern for a line infection. It is important to remove the line and send the tip for culture to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the chest X-ray appears clear, VAP should still be considered in the differential diagnosis. Regular assessment of respiratory status and cultures should be"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**], a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU and requires surgical intervention for a laryngeal stricture. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and sedation with versed/fentanyl. She has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, and her hypertension is being managed with multiple drugs. She also has ESRD and is on maintenance dialysis, as well as treatment for type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture: The patient's respiratory distress and laryngeal stricture require surgical intervention. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further airway compromise and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis indicate an infection. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications like intracranial hemorrhage or myocardial infarction.
4. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing dialysis treatment. Non-compliance"

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, leading to concern for a possible line infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Vancomycin has been started while cultures are pending, and consideration is given to broadening coverage if the patient's condition worsens. The patient also has respiratory distress and requires a tracheostomy due to laryngeal stricture. Her hypertension is well-controlled on labetalol. She has end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis three times a week. Her diabetes is well-managed with NPH insulin. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU, with plans for early dialysis before surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis raise concern for a line infection, particularly given the recent femoral line placement. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining sterile techniques are important to prevent further complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the chest X-ray is clear, VAP cannot be completely ruled out. Close monitoring of respiratory status and consideration of early weaning from mechanical ventilation may help prevent this complication.
3. Hypertension: While the patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. The patient was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition includes fevers and leukocytosis, which raises concern for a possible line infection, especially considering the recent removal of the femoral line. Vancomycin was administered empirically to treat for presumed line infection, and the tip of the femoral line was sent for culture.

The patient also requires respiratory support and is intubated. There are plans for a tracheostomy early this week. The patient has a history of hypertensive urgency but is currently well-controlled on Labetolol. She is also undergoing hemodialysis for her end-stage renal disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - Although the chest X-ray is clear, it is still important to monitor for any signs of VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) - The removal of the femoral line and sending the tip for culture suggests concern for a possible line infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and critical illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU with multi-organ failure and septic shock. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with a heart rate of 180 beats per minute and blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg. The patient required immediate resuscitation and was placed on mechanical ventilation.

Since admission, the patient's condition has been complicated by several medical events. On day 1, the patient developed a fever and was found to have a central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI). The central line was removed, and the tip was sent for culture. Empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was initiated.

On day 2, the patient's tube feeding residuals remained high, indicating ongoing issues with gastrointestinal tolerance. The labetalol dosage was increased to better control the patient's blood pressure.

On day 3, the patient's heart rate remained elevated, and hydralazine was administered to help control the tachycardia. The patient's respiratory support was adjusted to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 75-88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129-157/37-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 4003], a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and is on a ventilator. She is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/leukocystosis: There is concern about a possible line infection due to the femoral line or tunneled dialysis catheter. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also considered, but less likely given the clear chest X-ray. No evidence of cholestasis or other fever source has been found. Vancomycin has been started while cultures are pending, and treatment will be continued for 8 days total for line infection. If the patient's condition worsens, broader coverage will be added to include gram-negative rods. The femoral line tip culture has been negative so far, and cultures will be followed up.

2. Respiratory distress/laryngeal stricture: The patient remains intubated and on the ventilator. Sedation with versed/fentanyl will"

   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   2)Respiratory distress / laryngeal stricture: now has trach, still on
   vent
   -- Wean vent & sedation with propofol
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history significant for subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and unable to be extubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedated with propofol. She received a dose of hydralazine to lower her blood pressure, which was 190s. The arterial line was discontinued.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has been afebrile since starting vancomycin. She is being treated for a potential line infection given her femoral line versus tunneled dialysis catheter. Vancomycin was held due to supratherapeutic trough levels (30s), and it will be rechecked. Vancomycin at a dose of 1 gm every 12 hours once trough <20 is recommended, with a total treatment duration of 8 days for the line infection. If the patient clinically deteriorates, broader coverage including gram-negative rods may be added. The femoral line tip culture is negative to date, and cultures will be followed up.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#1 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   1) Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   2) Fevers/leukocystosis: Pt has been afebrile on Vanc.  She is getting
   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.
   7) Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped this
   AM.  Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation
   to fully clear.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently unable to be extubated. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and remains on mechanical ventilation due to difficulty weaning. The potential medical complications include respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, type II diabetes mellitus, venous thrombosis, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to be extubated and the need for tracheostomy suggest ongoing respiratory failure. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator may be due to deconditioning of respiratory muscles.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been afebrile on vancomycin but has a line infection. Treatment for the line infection should continue, and vancomycin trough levels should be monitored.
3. Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertensive urgency initially, which has now been well-controlled with oral labetalol.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
5. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Blood sugars are well-controlled on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#1 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   1) Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   2) Fevers/leukocystosis: Pt has been afebrile on Vanc.  She is getting
   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.
   7) Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped this
   AM.  Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation
   to fully clear.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4003] is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently unable to be extubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on POD#1. She remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by subglottic laryngeal edema. The plan is to wean off the vent as tolerated, trying pressure support or mandatory minute volume to encourage spontaneous breathing and strengthen respiratory muscles.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to subglottic laryngeal edema, which has been partially addressed with tracheostomy. However, the patient continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator. Deconditioning of respiratory muscles may contribute to this difficulty. Close monitoring and gradual weaning are essential to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with fevers and leukocytosis, which improved with vancomycin treatment. However, the patient's vancomycin trough levels were supratherapeutic, prompting the hold on vancomycin administration. The plan is to recheck the trough levels, resume vancomycin once the levels are below "

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#2 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   - Fevers: Pt w/ low grade fevers since OR.  She is currently getting
   tx
d for possible line infection given prior R femoral line vs.
   tunneled dialysis catheter.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- f/u cultures
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   -Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by subglottic laryngeal edema, but is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers since the operation and is being treated for a possible line infection. Blood cultures have been obtained and Vancomycin is being administered. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with oral Labetolol. She continues to receive hemodialysis twice a week and her diabetes is managed with NPH insulin. The patient's mental status is minimally responsive even after stopping sedation, and she is being closely monitored."

","The patient in the ICU has shown a low-grade fever of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the evening. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 75-89 beats per minute, blood pressure between 125-139/38-44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Famotidine (Pepcid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Nutren Renal (Full) for nutrition. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 266 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, normal sodium and potassium levels, slightly low magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL, and normal glucose level. The results also show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated creatinine level, and decreased total CO2 level. Other lab values are within normal range.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Further investigation through cultures and imaging may be necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance over the past 24 hours shows a total input of 509 mL and output of 345 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 164 mL. Close monitoring of fluid intake and"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#2 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   - Fevers: Pt w/ low grade fevers since OR.  She is currently getting
   tx
d for possible line infection given prior R femoral line vs.
   tunneled dialysis catheter.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- f/u cultures
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   -Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to subglottic laryngeal edema, difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, low-grade fevers since the operation, and potential line infection. She also has hypertension, which is well controlled with oral medication. She requires hemodialysis three times a week due to end-stage renal disease. Her diabetes is type II and is managed with insulin. She has stable anemia, and there is a consideration for future intervention for venous thrombosis due to functional superior vena cava syndrome. Her mental status is minimally responsive, and she is closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure could worsen if she is unable to be weaned off the ventilator successfully. Continuous monitoring and reassessment of her respiratory status are necessary.
2. Line infection: The low-grade fevers and potential line infection pose a risk of bloodstream infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and follow-up cultures are essential to prevent further complications.
3. Hypertension: While the patient's blood pressure is currently well controlled, there is a risk of complications related to hypertension if it becomes uncontrolled again. Close monitoring and adjustment of medication as needed are necessary.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient's renal condition requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage her renal function. Any complications related to dialysis or fluid balance should be closely monitored.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed appropriately to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia-related complications. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and insulin adjustment are necessary.
6. Anemia: Although stable at the moment, the patient's anemia should be closely monitored to prevent any complications related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
7. Venous thrombosis: The consideration for future intervention for venous thrombosis highlights the potential risk of blood clots. Regular assessment of her venous circulation and appropriate management if necessary are important.
8. Mental status: The patient's minimally responsive mental status requires close observation and monitoring for any changes or deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. She underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on POD#3. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to subglottic laryngeal edema, which has improved with tracheostomy and successful weaning from ventilation. She also has fevers, possibly related to a line infection, and is receiving treatment with vancomycin. The patient is experiencing loose stools and has negative cultures for Clostridium difficile. 

Mental status is minimally responsive even after stopping sedation, and it is expected to take days for the sedation to fully clear. The patient initially presented with hypertensive urgency but is now well-controlled on labetalol. 

She continues to receive hemodialysis twice weekly and her diabetes is well-controlled on the current regimen. Anemia is stable, and there are plans for an outpatient workup. There is a history of venous thrombosis, but currently, no evidence of clot is detected on renal ultrasound.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and recent hypoxic respiratory distress pose a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#3 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has tracheostomy
   and has successfully weaned from vent. Overall respiratory status much
   improved.
   - Fevers: Pt spiked fever yesterday afternoon but has remained HD
   stable. She is currently getting tx
d for possible line infection given
   prior R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis catheter.  Vanco
   therapeutic.  Pt having loose stool.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD; sent UA/Cx; first C. Diff negative, will repeat
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection; [**2173-9-24**] = day 5
   -- f/u cultures
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   - Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team.  RLE US negative for evidence of clot

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was found unresponsive after experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures. She has successfully weaned from the ventilator and has improved respiratory status. The patient also presented with fevers, and a line infection is being treated with vancomycin. She has loose stools and is at risk for Clostridium difficile infection. Her mental status remains minimally responsive, and sedation is being closely monitored. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with oral labetalol. She requires ongoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. Her diabetes mellitus is well-controlled, and anemia is stable. There is a consideration for future intervention for venous thrombosis due to functional superior vena cava syndrome, but anticoagulation is currently held per renal team. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. There is a potential for recurrence of respiratory failure if the tracheostomy becomes obstructed or if the patient develops another infection.
2. Line infection: The patient is being treated for a line infection with vancomycin. It is important to monitor for any"
