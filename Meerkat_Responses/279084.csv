   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   84M 2 days of hematuria along with hematemesis today. Following
   hematemesis, intubated in ER for respiratory distress. Referred to [**Hospital1 **]
   because of misplaced foley.
   In our ER, afebrile, on vent. Labs showed creatinine 4, WBC 32, lactate
   7.7, 7.15/42/290 on AC. Seen by urology who re-placed foley and abd CT
   showed free fluid in pelvis and foley in prostatic urethra - uro again
   repositioned foley.
   In ICU, stable on vent. No evidence of GI bleeding.  He was given
   bicarb and acidosis improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been experiencing hematuria and hematemesis, leading to intubation in the ER for respiratory distress. The patient was referred to [**Hospital1**] due to a misplaced Foley catheter. In the ER, he was found to have an elevated creatinine level of 4, leukocytosis with a WBC count of 32, and an elevated lactate level of 7.7. An abdominal CT scan showed free fluid in the pelvis and the Foley catheter placed in the prostatic urethra. Urology repositioned the Foley catheter. The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Acidosis improved after administration of bicarbonate. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for intubation indicate severe respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and ventilator support are necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine level of 4 suggests acute kidney injury. Volume resuscitation and careful management of fluid balance are crucial.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of hematemesis and ongoing blood loss may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was intubated in the emergency room for respiratory distress and referred to the hospital due to a misplaced Foley catheter. The patient has a history of several medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hematuria, diabetes mellitus type 2, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, deep vein thrombosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cerebrovascular accident, and anxiety.

The patient presented with hematuria, hematemesis, and dyspnea. An abdominal CT scan showed free fluid in the pelvis and the Foley catheter in the prostatic urethra. In the ICU, the patient has been stable on mechanical ventilation with no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, he is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to severe emphysema and possible left lower lobe infiltrate, which could be a result of aspiration from hematemesis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with adequate oxygenation, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure proper lung function and prevent further complications.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 4, indicating potential acute renal failure. Volume resuscitation and careful monitoring of renal function are essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

   Assessment and Plan: An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**]
   Hospital with respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who
   has now developed a pressor requirement.
   Shock:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Now with acute
   hypoTN on evening of [**12-18**] and started on pressors which he continues
   on.
   - Need to get influenza DFA
   - Fluc, Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro, Tamiflu all started [**12-18**]  for empiric
   coverage of bowel flora, urinary pathogens and pulmonary pathogens
   - F/u Cx's which all continue to be negative.
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - Need to get sputum Cx's (mini-BAL vs ETT sputum sample) and stool if
   he has BM for Cdiff, Cx's
   - He has shown improvement with IVF's and got
   - Consider echo to r/o cardiogenic shock, with h/o rhythm abnmls and
   pacer. CVP is [**8-3**].
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - place central line to assess CVP and allow for pressors
   - Follow up microbiology from [**Hospital3 **] hospital, thus far negative
   - Trend lactate until normal
   - Wean Levophed as tolerated
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated.
   - consider RSBI tomorrow but not likely to be successful unless
   underlying condition addressed
   - influenza DFA, empiric tamiflu
   - vanacomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxacin for empiric coverage of severe
   pneumonia and sepsis
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been rising and is most likely due to
   the D5W with HCO3 that he got yesterday. Would continue to trend and if
   continues to be high, consider Acetazolamide.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown.  Likely prerenal in
   the setting of sepsis, may also have component of ATN and initially
   post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now successfully placed. Cr has
   been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - trend UOP with IVF and pressors to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if
   possible

   - foley catheter now in place
   Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the MICU
   and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's have
   been in the 100's.

   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has developed sepsis, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient's blood sugar levels were initially in the 500s and have been brought down to the 100s with insulin gtt. He has been started on multiple antibiotics for empiric coverage of various pathogens. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and possible traumatic Foley placement. The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate. The source of infection could be urinary, given his history of hematuria and small infiltrate on lung imaging.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory failure, which is likely due to pneumonia. He requires mechanical ventilation and has a possible developing left-sided infiltrate.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient initially had very high blood sugar levels (500s) but has been managed with insulin gtt and is now in the 100s."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. He has developed severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient also has hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving multiple medications including pressors, and has a central line in place. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including a traumatic Foley placement, atrial fibrillation with PVCs, and coronary artery disease. The patient has a DNR code and no chest compressions are desired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate levels are consistent with sepsis. Possible sources include urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the coverage may need to be narrowed based on culture data.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying conditions.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine is unknown, but he is showing signs of acute renal failure. His creatinine levels are trending down with IV fluids and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with severe emphysema, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with respiratory failure, hematuria, hematemesis, severe lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a Foley catheter in place. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 69-118 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/52 to 126/55 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and central venous pressure is 1 mmHg. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 8,070 mL and output of 2,105 mL over 24 hours. Blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including norepinephrine, insulin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. 

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, non-tender firm abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive and able to follow simple commands, but no movement or tone assessment was performed. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit, mildly elevated platelet count, elevated blood glucose, and abnormalities in electrolytes. Microbiology tests show the presence of GPCs in chains in blood culture and negative gram stain in urine culture. 

Assessment and plan include sepsis with severe organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis, development of further electrolyte imbalances, worsening renal function, and potential infections due to the presence of a Foley catheter."

   Imaging: ECHO [**12-19**]
   IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. There is an increased
   gradient seen along the right ventricular outflow tract. This could be
   from infra-pulmonic, supra-pulmonic or pulmonic valve stenosis. There
   may be extrinsic compression of the RVOT/proximal pulmonary artery
   causing this gradient. No other valvular abnormality seen. No evidence
   of endocarditis (cannot exclude). Small anteriori pericardial effusion
   without evidence of tamponade.
   CXR [**12-19**]
   The ET tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
   has
   been advanced in the interim giving the absence of the sidehole above
   the
   diaphragm. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Extensive
   opacities
   within the lungs are present. Interval development of vascular
   engorgement is seen that might be consistent with volume overload/mild
   pulmonary edema. Note
   is made that the left costophrenic angle was excluded from the field of
   view.
   Microbiology: 2 of 3 C.Diff tests are negative.  The 3rd is still

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Shock:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Acute hypoTN on
   evening of [**12-18**]; started on pressors which he has now been weaned
   from.  Influenza DFA negative.  ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic shock
   - Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enteroccus in urine and
   GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in pairs and
   clusters in sputum as well as yeast. Would restart fluconazole
   - F/u Cx's from both this institution and also f/u final reads from OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - passed RSBI this morning, consider SBT
   - Vanc, Zosyn for coverage of severe pneumonia and sepsis; add
   fluconazole
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some resp alkalosis
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely prerenal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - foley catheter now in place
 do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guaiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.
   - can restart digoxin as renal failure has improved.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - digoxin level 1.7
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - holding aspirin
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - holding statin as NPO
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, IV PPI

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He developed a pressor requirement upon admission and presented with signs of sepsis. Possible sources of infection include urinary tract infection and pneumonia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is experiencing respiratory failure. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating it well. The sputum culture shows budding yeast with pseudohyphae and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unknown, but he was likely experiencing prerenal acute kidney injury due to sepsis. There may also be a component of acute tubular necrosis and post-renal obstruction. A Foley catheter has been successfully placed to monitor urine output and maintain urine output above 30 cc/hr.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level has been rising, which is most likely due to the administration of D5W with HCO3. Trending and monitoring the bicarbonate levels will help determine if acetazolamide is needed to correct the alkalosis.

4. Elevated Blood Sugars: The patient's blood sugars were initially in the 500s, indicating hyperglycemia. He has been started on insulin gtt and his"

   may be extrinsic compression of the RVOT/proximal pulmonary artery
   causing this gradient. No other valvular abnormality seen. No evidence
   of endocarditis (cannot exclude). Small anteriori pericardial effusion
   without evidence of tamponade.
   CXR [**12-19**]
   The ET tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
   has
   been advanced in the interim giving the absence of the sidehole above
   the
   diaphragm. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Extensive
   opacities
   within the lungs are present. Interval development of vascular
   engorgement is seen that might be consistent with volume overload/mild
   pulmonary edema. Note
   is made that the left costophrenic angle was excluded from the field of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He presented with altered mental status, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe emphysema and requires mechanical ventilation. He also has metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, elevated blood sugars, hematemesis, traumatic Foley placement, atrial fibrillation/PVCs, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures for bacteria and yeast in the urine and blood. This could lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for developing left-sided infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is rising, possibly due to the administration of D5W with HCO3. Close monitoring and potential treatment with acetazolamide may be necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is unknown, but he has signs of prerenal, intrinsic, and post-renal causes of renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine is essential.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient initially had significantly elevated blood sugars, but they"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with severe COPD who was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), septic shock, and respiratory failure. He has shown improvement during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and cardiac dysrhythmia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is described as very poor, and he is essentially unresponsive. Further evaluation with an EEG is planned.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, he still requires ventilator support. The possibility of extubation may be considered if his mental status improves.
3. Foley Trauma: The Foley catheter will continue to be used for now.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has atrial flutter with a controlled rate. Anticoagulation is being held off due to the presence of hematemesis.
5. ICU Care: The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. UTI: The patient has enterococcus in his urine.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to: his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from medications, and/or concern for seizure as well.
   Is off sedation and mental status continues to be altered.
   - Neurology consult today
   - Head CT without contrast
   - Consider EEG
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Acute hypotension
   on evening of [**12-18**]; started on pressors which he has now been weaned
   off of.  Influenza DFA negative.  ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic
   shock. Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enterococcus in
   urine and GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in
   pairs and clusters in sputum as well as yeast.
   - D/c vanc, zosyn, now that we have enterococcus sensitivities
   - D/c fluconazole
   - Start ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for total of
   14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this 14-day
   course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - F/u Cx's from both [**Hospital1 5**] and OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - ABG
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix for goal 1L negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some respiratory
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - restart home aspirin 81mg daily
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - restart home statin, lipitor 10mg daily
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, IV PPI
   Access: CVL and Art line have now been placed, also have 20g PIV
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: MICU
intubated and altered mental status
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has been unresponsive since arrival and this could be due to various factors such as infection, toxic/metabolic effects from medications, or concern for seizure activity. The patient is off sedation, but mental status continues to be altered.

The patient presented with an elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources of infection are urinary given the patient's history and a small infiltrate in the lungs. Acute hypotension on the evening of 12/18 led to the initiation of pressors, which have since been weaned off. Influenza DFA was negative, and an ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic shock. The patient has been started on vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage of enterococcus in the urine and GPC chains in the blood. However, the enterococcus is resistant to ciprofloxacin, levo, PCN, and tetracycline but sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue vancomycin and Zosyn now that we have the enterococcus sensitivities and start ampicillin for a total of 14-day course of antibiotics (including vancomycin in this 14-day course).

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from the medications he is on.  Worry about seizure as
   well.
   - Treat infections as below
   -  EEG
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Acute hypoTN on
   evening of [**12-18**]; started on pressors which he has now been weaned
   from.  Influenza DFA negative.  ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic shock
   - Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enteroccus in urine and
   GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in pairs and
   clusters in sputum as well as yeast. Would restart fluconazole
   - F/u Cx's from both this institution and also f/u final reads from OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Vanc, Zosyn for coverage of severe pneumonia and sepsis; add
   fluconazole
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some resp alkalosis
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely prerenal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - foley catheter now in place
 do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guaiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - holding aspirin
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - holding statin as NPO
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, IV PPI
   Access: CVL and Art line have now been placed, also have 20g PIV
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has developed a pressor requirement upon admission. The patient is currently unresponsive and has altered mental status since arrival at the hospital. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with an elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate, which are consistent with sepsis. Possible sources of infection include urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to prerenal, intrinsic, or post-renal causes. Foley catheter has been placed successfully.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level has been rising, most likely due to the administration of D5W with HCO3. Monitoring and treating the metabolic alkalosis is necessary.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory failure. He is on CPAP and tolerated well, but continues to require mechanical ventilation.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient had significantly elevated blood sugars initially but has been brought under control with insulin. Close monitoring of blood sugars is required.
6. Traumatic Foley Placement: There was concern about the traumatic placement of the Foley catheter, which"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to: his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from medications, and/or concern for seizure as well.
   - Treat infections as below
   - EEG
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Acute hypotension
   on evening of [**12-18**]; started on pressors which he has now been weaned
   off of.  Influenza DFA negative.  ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic shock
   - Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enterococcus in urine and
   GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in pairs and
   clusters in sputum as well as yeast. ????????????Would restart
   fluconazole
   - F/u Cx's from both this institution and also f/u final reads from OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   - Confirm enterococcus sensitivities from OSH
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Vanc, Zosyn for coverage of severe pneumonia and sepsis; add
   fluconazole??????
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some respiratory
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - holding aspirin
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - holding statin as NPO??????

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has a history of severe emphysema, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is unresponsive and has altered mental status. He has been treated for infections, including enterococcus in the urine and GPC in the blood. He has also been treated for severe pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, acute respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress and lead to further deterioration of lung function, potentially resulting in respiratory arrest.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. If not managed properly, this can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications related to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is disturbed, which can lead to various complications such as cardiac arr"

The patient is an 84-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. He developed a pressor requirement upon admission and has been unresponsive since arriving at the hospital. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and traumatic Foley placement.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing infection and sepsis. Proper management of the suspected sources of infection (urinary tract and respiratory) is crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe emphysema and developing left-sided infiltrate indicate the need for continued mechanical ventilation and weaning as tolerated.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: Monitoring bicarbonate levels and considering acetazolamide if high, especially since there is some respiratory alkalosis.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to: his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from medications, and/or concern for seizure as well.
   Is off sedation and mental status continues to be altered.
   - Neurology consult today
   - Head CT without contrast
   - Consider EEG
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Possible sources
   are urinary given history and LLL small infiltrate. Acute hypotension
   on evening of [**12-18**]; started on pressors which he has now been weaned
   off of.  Influenza DFA negative.  ECHO did not reveal cardiogenic
   shock. Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enterococcus in
   urine and GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in
   pairs and clusters in sputum as well as yeast.
   - D/c vanc, zosyn, now that we have enterococcus sensitivities
   - D/c fluconazole
   - Start ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for total of
   14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this 14-day
   course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - F/u Cx's from both [**Hospital1 5**] and OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - ABG
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix for goal 1L negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some respiratory
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - restart home aspirin 81mg daily
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - restart home statin, lipitor 10mg daily
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, IV PPI
   Access: CVL and Art line have now been placed, also have 20g PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of being unresponsive. The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. The patient developed sepsis, severe respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 121/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and a recent Foley catheter placement.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's urine culture revealed Enterococcus species that are resistant to multiple antibiotics but sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin.

The patient's imaging studies show decreased opacities on chest X-ray (CXR) on December 20th, indicating improvement in lung infiltrates. The patient's blood cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's current treatment plan includes the initiation of ampicillin for Enterococcus infection, discontinuation of vancomycin and fluconazole, and continued mechanical ventilation. The"

   - Vanc, Zosyn started [**12-18**]  for coverage of  enteroccus in urine and
   GPC
s in chains in the blood,  Here there are gm + cocci in pairs and
   clusters in sputum as well as yeast. Would restart fluconazole
   - F/u Cx's from both this institution and also f/u final reads from OSH
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - Trend lactate until normal
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Vanc, Zosyn for coverage of severe pneumonia and sepsis; add
   fluconazole
   - albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some resp alkalosis
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely prerenal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - foley catheter now in place
 do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guaiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - holding aspirin
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - holding statin as NPO
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, IV PPI
   Access: CVL and Art line have now been placed, also have 20g PIV

","Summary:
An 84-year-old gentleman was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He required pressor support upon admission. The patient has been altered since arrival, with unresponsiveness that could be due to infection or toxic/metabolic effects of medications. There is a concern for seizure activity as well. The patient's conditions include sepsis, acute respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte/fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and possible acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate, all consistent with sepsis. Possible sources of infection include the urinary tract and pneumonia.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema and respiratory failure, which may worsen due to pneumonia or other complications.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient had blood sugars in the 500s upon arrival to the MICU but has been stabilized with insulin therapy.
4. Electrolyte/Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which need to be corrected.
5. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Enterococcus, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and may have altered mental status due to"

   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to: his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from medications, and/or concern for seizure as well.
   Is off sedation and mental status continues to be altered.
   - Neurology consult yesterday; appreciate their rec
   .
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Now afebrile.
   - Start ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for total of
   14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this 14-day
   course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - ABG
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status;
   does not appear to have appropriate mental status for extubation yet
   - passed RSBI this morning, attempt SBT
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix now and likely repeat this afternoon for goal 1L
   negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some respiratory
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder diverticulum.
    Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are to keep Foley
   in place, do not remove without asking urology first, keep secure to
   thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when acute illness
   over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: MICU
intubated and altered mental status
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate, and was admitted from another hospital. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient has several medical conditions, including sepsis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and altered mental status (not delirium). The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR). The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

intubated and altered mental status
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He developed a pressor requirement upon admission and was diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has a history of severe emphysema, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. He underwent a traumatic Foley placement and had multiple old infarcts in the right frontal region and thalami, with no acute process on a head CT. The patient is currently being treated with ampicillin for urosepsis, CPAP for respiratory failure, and IV fluids for resuscitation and maintaining urine output and mean arterial pressure. His altered mental status is improving, and he is now interactive and following commands. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are being closely monitored, and he has shown improvement in his blood sugar levels. The patient's code status is DNR, and his family is very involved in his care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure and has been placed on CPAP. He will need close monitoring, and if tolerated, an attempt for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be made. The patient may require extubation once his mental status improves.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to a UTI. He is currently on ampic"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient has been altered since arrival at [**Hospital 1249**].  He is unresponsive.  This could be due to: his infection,
   toxic/metabolic from medications, and/or concern for seizure as well.
   Is off sedation and mental status continues to be altered.
   - Neurology consult today
   - Head CT without contrast
   - Consider EEG
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Now afebrile.
   - Start ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for total of
   14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this 14-day
   course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - ABG
   - sputum culture as above
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status
   - passed RSBI this morning, no SBT in wake of altered mental status
   continuing
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix for goal 1L negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising;  most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.  Is normal today.  Has some respiratory
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline creatinine unknown. On admission, was
   likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component of
   ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Get EKG this morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - restart home aspirin 81mg daily
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - restart home statin, lipitor 10mg daily
   .

intubated and altered mental status
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has a history of multiple previous urinary tract infections (UTIs), severe emphysema, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and recent traumatic Foley catheter placement. The patient is currently intubated and has altered mental status, which could be due to infection, medication toxicity, or concern for seizure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and off sedation, with ongoing altered mental status. This could be due to various factors including infection, medication toxicity, or seizure activity. Further evaluation with a neurology consult, head CT without contrast, and consideration of an EEG is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient presented with elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. He has a history of multiple UTIs, and his current infection appears to be urosepsis. The patient is now on ampicillin as part of a 14-day antibiotic course based on previous sensitivities.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is experiencing respiratory failure. He was previously on assisted ventilation but has been switched to CPAP and tolerated it well. ABG results show improvement. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary, and we"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with severe COPD, admitted with sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI). He has had persistently poor mental status and neurology consults yesterday recommended a CT head. The patient is more awake today and following some commands, although he is very weak. He has a history of embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be a source of emboli. However, anticoagulation cannot be initiated now due to his recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and he requires mechanical ventilation. He also has hyperglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and electrolyte imbalances. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen his condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if adequate oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure ulcers, especially in vulnerable areas such as the sacrum or heels.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent history of"

   The ET tube tip is approximately 8.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube
   tip
   passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of
   view.
   The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The
   pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and most likely in the
   proximal
   portion of the right ventricle.
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Extensive parenchymal
   opacities
   seen in the right mid lung and left lower lobe are unchanged as well
   overlying
   with significant degree of hyperinflation, most likely due to
   emphysema.
   Thickening of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and most likely
   chronic as well as apical thickening in the right.
   Overall, no significant change since [**2129-12-18**] is demonstrated.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient is now improving and is now interactive
   and following commands, though extremely week.  His altered mental
   status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic
   from medications.  He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and
   neck did not reveal abnormalities.
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   If no other etiology identified or if positive blood culture then would
   consider LP but would hold off at this time.
   - If clinical concern for seizures, could consider repeating EEG.
   - Avoid medications which would likely alter mental status.
   .
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Just spiked this morning, and
   was cultured (blood, urine, yellow sputum). Concern for pneumonia.
   - Now on just ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for
   total of 14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this
   14-day course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - Add vancomycin, cefepime, cipro for synergy for strep viridians
   treatment and for pseudomonas double-coverage
   - D/c ampicillin
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental and resp
   status
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix now and likely repeat this afternoon for goal 1L
   negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.   Has some respiratory alkalosis.
   - repeat ABG this morning.  Had a gas suggestive of returning metabolic
   alkalosis.
   - repeat ABG this afternoon
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.  PO PPI (lansoprazole).
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: MICU
intubated and altered mental status
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has a history of multiple previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) and required a traumatic Foley catheter placement at another hospital. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for suspected urosepsis. 

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially had an altered mental status but is now improving and is interactive and following commands. This could be due to infection and toxic/metabolic effects from medications. The cause of altered mental status is multifactorial.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with signs of sepsis, including elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate. He appears to have urosepsis, and his blood cultures have been obtained. There is a concern for pneumonia as well.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema on CT scan and is experiencing respiratory failure. He was on assist-control (AC) ventilation but has been switched to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and tolerated it well. ABG results are improving.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are rising, likely due to D5W with HCO3. If this continues, acetazolamide may be considered"

   Imaging: [**2129-12-22**]
   The ET tube tip is approximately 8.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube
   tip
   passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of
   view.
   The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The
   pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and most likely in the
   proximal
   portion of the right ventricle.
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Extensive parenchymal
   opacities
   seen in the right mid lung and left lower lobe are unchanged as well
   overlying
   with significant degree of hyperinflation, most likely due to
   emphysema.
   Thickening of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and most likely
   chronic as well as apical thickening in the right.
   Overall, no significant change since [**2129-12-18**] is demonstrated.
   [**12-21**] CTA of head and Neck FINAL
   IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on CT angiography of the head.
   Microbiology: MINI BAL - not adequate
   Cdiff negative

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient is now improving and is now interactive
   and following commands, though extremely week.  His altered mental
   status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic
   from medications.  He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and
   neck did not reveal abnormalities.
   - Neurology consult yesterday; appreciate their rec
   - Recommend broad infectious workup, including possible CT torso.
   If no other etiology identified or if positive blood culture then
   would consider LP but would hold off at this time.
   - continue evaluation and treatment of any toxic/metabolic
   abnormalities which may be contributing.
   - If clinical concern for seizures, could consider repeating EEG.
   - Avoid medications which would likely alter mental status.
   .
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Now afebrile.
   - Now on just ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for
   total of 14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this
   14-day course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - Consider readding vancomycin or starting gentamicin for synergy for
   strep viridians treatment.
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status;
   with improving mental status, may be almost ready for extubation.
   - passed RSBI this morning, attempt SBT
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix now and likely repeat this afternoon for goal 1L
   negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.   Has some respiratory alkalosis.
   - repeat ABG this morning.  Had a gas suggestive of returning metabolic
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.  PO PPI (lansoprazole).
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. He required a pressor upon admission and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate, indicating sepsis. The patient also had a history of multiple urinary tract infections and a traumatic foley placement. He was started on ampicillin for a total of 14 days based on the sensitivity results from previous hospitalization.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by severe emphysema, as shown on the CT scan, and he has been intubated and placed on CPAP. His ABG results have been improving, suggesting readiness for weaning off mechanical ventilation.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is likely due to the D5W with HCO3. If the bicarbonate levels continue to rise, consideration can be given to using acetazolamide. The patient's acute renal failure is improving with IV fluids and Foley catheter placement. Trending creatinine and urine output with IVF will be important to maintain adequate urine output.

The patient has a history of hematemesis, but currently, the guiac test is negative with bilious NG tube drainage. PO PPI (lansoprazole) is being continued, and the hematocrits should be trended. An active type and screen should be done, and transfusion goals should be less than "

   The ET tube tip is approximately 8.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube
   tip
   passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of
   view.
   The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The
   pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and most likely in the
   proximal
   portion of the right ventricle.
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Extensive parenchymal
   opacities
   seen in the right mid lung and left lower lobe are unchanged as well
   overlying
   with significant degree of hyperinflation, most likely due to
   emphysema.
   Thickening of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and most likely
   chronic as well as apical thickening in the right.
   Overall, no significant change since [**2129-12-18**] is demonstrated.
   [**12-21**] CTA of head and Neck FINAL
   IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on CT angiography of the head.
   Microbiology: MINI BAL - not adequate

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Patient is now improving and is now interactive
   and following commands, though extremely week.  His altered mental
   status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic
   from medications.  He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and
   neck did not reveal abnormalities.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Recommend broad infectious workup, including possible CT torso.
   If no other etiology identified or if positive blood culture then would
   consider LP but would hold off at this time.
   - continue evaluation and treatment of any toxic/metabolic
   abnormalities which may be contributing.
   - If clinical concern for seizures, could consider repeating EEG.
   - Avoid medications which would likely alter mental status.
   .
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Just spiked this morning, and
   was cultured (blood, urine, yellow sputum). Concern for pneumonia.
   - Now on just ampicillin (enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive) for
   total of 14 day course of antibiotics (include the vancomycin in this
   14-day course; started [**12-18**], 14-day course ends [**2129-12-31**])
   - Add vancomycin, cefepime, cipro for synergy for strep viridians
   treatment and for pseudomonas double-coverage
   - D/c ampicillin
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   .
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was on AC yesterday
   but has switched to CPAP and tolerated fairly well, with good ABG's.
   - continue mechanical ventilation, wean as tolerated by mental status;
   with improving mental status, may be almost ready for extubation.
   - passed RSBI this morning, attempt SBT
   - Ampicillin for urosepsis
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - 20mg IV lasix now and likely repeat this afternoon for goal 1L
   negative today; check 3 PM lytes
   .
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3. Will continue to trend and if continues to be high,
   consider Acetazolamide.   Has some respiratory alkalosis.
   - repeat ABG this morning.  Had a gas suggestive of returning metabolic
   alkalosis.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   .
   #Hematemasis:  Unclear history.  Currently guiac negative with bilious
   NGT drainage.  PO PPI (lansoprazole).
   - trend hematocrits
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal < 30 in septic shock; but improving today so will
   likely just follow
   - restart home ASA
   .
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   .
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   .
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with respiratory failure and enterococcal sepsis from a urinary tract infection. He is currently doing well and is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 132/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 0 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 0 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 107. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and warm skin. Neurological assessment is not available due to intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of fever, increased secretions, and a slightly elevated respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), which indicates the possibility of developing VAP. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been started.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has been diagnosed with diarrhea, which can be a side effect of the medications he is receiving or a complication of his underlying condition.
3. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is described as ventricular paced, suggesting the presence of a cardiac dysrhythmia. This could potentially lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, and fluid balance, indicating a possible electrolyte and fluid disorder. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This condition requires management through insulin therapy or other appropriate measures.
6. Altered mental status: Although the patient's mental status is currently improving, his prolonged illness and complications may contribute to further deterioration. Regular neurological assessments are recommended.
7. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury or muscle weakness.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and a thorough evaluation of the patient's condition by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status was likely
   multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.
   He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis, has positive UCx here but all blood has been negative.
   Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley
   placement at OSH.  Was on just Ampicillin but now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to spiking fevers [**12-23**]. Continues
   currently on minimal pressure support and BP
s look good.
   - Will wean Levo today then d/c. If bp
s lower, go with IVF
s first, as
   his CVP is low, and BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, suggesting
   intravascularly down
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Can allow a more lenient goal of CO2 50 given that he has h/o COPD.
   - Serial ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but this am is tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - Will restart Digoxin today at home dose
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation given appearance of multiple ischemic events
   on head CT and history of atrial fibrillation, but this can be started
   once he is more stable.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; thought at first to be
   due to resuscitation with D5W with HCO3, but has now persisted. Other
   etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys, contraction alkalosis
   (less likely given 11L positive through LOS, however, he could be
   intravascularly deplete), posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been
   hypercapneic since admission), volume depletion (possible), hyperaldo,
   and hypoK (neither of which there have been much evidence for).  Will
   continue to trend and if continues to be high, consider
   Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds with pulmonary nutren, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: MICU
intubated and altered mental status
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate.
- He was admitted from another hospital with OSH Cx positive for GPC and was started on Ampicillin.
- The patient's temperature spiked despite the antibiotic treatment, so the antibiotic regimen was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro.
- He is currently intubated and on minimal pressors but is waking up, following commands, and appears much improved.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed for unclear underlying rhythm.
- He is currently paced and tachycardic, and his Digoxin level is normal.
- The patient's blood sugars were in the 500s upon arrival to the MICU and have since been brought under control with insulin.
- He has a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
- The patient's urine culture shows enterococcus and strep viridans.
- His white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, with an increased PaO2/FiO2 ratio.
- His C-reactive protein (CRP) level is significantly elevated, suggesting an inflammatory response.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and his sputum culture is poor.
- His arterial blood gases (ABGs"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is now improving and is now interactive
   and following commands, though extremely week.  His altered mental
   status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic
   from medications.  He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and
   neck did not reveal abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Just spiked this morning, and
   was cultured (blood, urine, yellow sputum). Concern for pneumonia. Was
   only on Ampicillin for enterococcus but after spiking temps [**12-23**] was
   started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, now day 2.
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3, other etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys,
   contraction alkalosis (less likely given 11L positive through LOS),
   posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been hypercapneic since
   admission), volume depletion, hyperaldo, and hypoK (neither of which
   there have been much evidence for).  Will continue to trend and if
   continues to be high, consider Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and altered mental status. The patient's conditions include endotracheal tube tip 4.8 cm above the carina, no significant change in cardiopulmonary pathology, minimal increase in left lung base opacity, and a possible old embolic infarct on head CT.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. There is concern for urosepsis due to multiple previous UTIs and a recent traumatic foley placement. The patient is currently on a 14-day course of ampicillin based on OSH sensitivities. If the patient continues to spike fevers, broadening the antibiotic coverage may be necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema on CT scan and is experiencing respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea and a possible developing left-sided infiltrate. The patient was switched between AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest. Further trials of CPAP with follow-up ABG and consideration of RSBI and S"

   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status was likely
   multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.
   He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal

   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis, has positive UCx here but all blood has been negative.
    Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley
   placement at OSH.  Was on just Ampicillin but now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to spiking fevers [**12-23**]. Continues
   currently on minimal pressure support and BP
s look good.
   - Will wean Levo today then d/c. If bp
s lower, go with IVF
s first, as
   his CVP is low, and BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, suggesting
   intravascularly down
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90

   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Can allow a more lenient goal of CO2 50 given that he has h/o COPD.
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but this am is tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - Will restart Digoxin today at home dose
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation given appearance of multiple ischemic events
   on head CT and history of atrial fibrillation, but this can be started
   once he is more stable.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; thought at first to be
   due to resuscitation with D5W with HCO3, but has now persisted. Other
   etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys, contraction alkalosis
   (less likely given 11L positive through LOS, however, he could be
   intravascularly deplete), posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been
   hypercapneic since admission), volume depletion (possible), hyperaldo,
   and hypoK (neither of which there have been much evidence for).  Will

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He developed a fever and was started on antibiotics, but his condition worsened, leading to the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, urinary tract infection, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated, there is a risk of developing pneumonia as a result of the mechanical ventilation.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which can cause bleeding.

4. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on minimal pressors, which can increase the risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias.

5. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring additional infections while in the ICU, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or infections related to the indwelling devices.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now branow
   continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is now improving and is now interactive
   and following commands, though extremely week.  His altered mental
   status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic
   from medications.  He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and
   neck did not reveal abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Just spiked this morning, and
   was cultured (blood, urine, yellow sputum). Concern for pneumonia. Was
   only on Ampicillin for enterococcus but after spiking temps [**12-23**] was
   started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, now day 2.
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3, other etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys,
   contraction alkalosis (less likely given 11L positive through LOS),
   posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been hypercapneic since
   admission), volume depletion, hyperaldo, and hypoK (neither of which
   there have been much evidence for).  Will continue to trend and if
   continues to be high, consider Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds with pulmonary nutren, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He was started on antibiotics but developed a fever, indicating a potential ongoing infection. The patient is intubated and on minimal pressors. His mental status has improved, and he is now interactive and following commands. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count, fever, and elevated lactate. He has been on multiple antibiotics, but there is still concern for pneumonia given his fever and recent spike.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is currently on assisted ventilation. There is a possibility of developing left-sided infiltrate, which could indicate pneumonia or worsening respiratory failure.
3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to D5W with HCO3. It is important to trend ABG's and check urine chloride levels.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was initially elevated but is now in the normal range. It is crucial to trend creatinine and urine output with intravenous fluids to maintain urine output above 30 cc/hr if possible.
5. Traumatic Foley placement: There was concern about the potential placement of the Foley catheter in the scrotum. Although initially thought to be intra-abdominal, it is now believed to be a"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro. Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors,
   but is waking up, following commands, and appears overall much
   improved.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status was likely
   multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.
   He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis.  Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with
   traumatic foley placement at OSH.  Now on just ampicillin with goal of
   14 day course based on OSH sensitivies.  Just spiked this morning, and
   was cultured (blood, urine, yellow sputum). Concern for pneumonia. Was
   only on Ampicillin for enterococcus but after spiking temps [**12-23**] was
   started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, now day 2.
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; most likely due to the
   D5W with HCO3, other etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys,
   contraction alkalosis (less likely given 11L positive through LOS),
   posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been hypercapneic since
   admission), volume depletion, hyperaldo, and hypoK (neither of which
   there have been much evidence for).  Will continue to trend and if
   continues to be high, consider Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 **] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation.  Currently in sinus tachycardia with PVCs/intermittent
   conduction block.  Digoxin level was normal.  [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation
   given appearance of multiple ischemic events on head CT and atrial
   fibrillation.  Will discuss with patient once extubated and possibly
   with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - no need to start digoxin because of rate being low
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EKG this morning
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds with pulmonary nutren, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, change IV PPI to PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Patient had been on PS
   to because he was tachycardic and tachypneic, this morning back onto
   CPAP.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Can allow a more lenient goal of CO2 50 given that he has h/o COPD.
   - Serial ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status was likely
   multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.
   He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis, has positive UCx here but all blood has been negative.
   Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley
   placement at OSH.  Was on just Ampicillin but now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to spiking fevers [**12-23**]. Continues
   currently on minimal pressure support and BP
s look good.
   - Will wean Levo today then d/c. If bp
s lower, go with IVF
s first, as
   his CVP is low, and BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, suggesting
   intravascularly down
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but this am is tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - Will restart Digoxin today at home dose
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation given appearance of multiple ischemic events
   on head CT and history of atrial fibrillation, but this can be started
   once he is more stable.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; thought at first to be
   due to resuscitation with D5W with HCO3, but has now persisted. Other
   etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys, contraction alkalosis
   (less likely given 11L positive through LOS, however, he could be
   intravascularly deplete), posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been
   hypercapneic since admission), volume depletion (possible), hyperaldo,
   and hypoK (neither of which there have been much evidence for).  Will
   continue to trend and if continues to be high, consider
   Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds with pulmonary nutren, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: MICU
intubated and altered mental status
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He required pressor support upon admission and was found to have OSH Cx positive for GPCs and strep viridans in urine. He was started on ampicillin but developed a fever, leading to broadening of antibiotics to include Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro due to enterococcus and strep viridans in the urine. The patient continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, showing improvement with waking up, following commands, and appearing overall much improved.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is experiencing respiratory failure. There is a possibility of developing left-sided infiltrate. The patient was on PS to control tachycardia and tachypnea, but this morning he was put back on CPAP. A trial of CPAP was attempted today with a follow-up ABG.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is improving, and he is now interactive and following commands. His altered mental status was likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications. He is being kept off sedation. A CTA of the head and neck did not reveal any abnormalities.

3. Sepsis: The patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hyp"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   Acute issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status was likely
   multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.
   He is being kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - Pt is improving from mental status standpoint, hold off on AMS
   producing meds, frequent reorientation, no sedation for now.
   - If decompensates, consider LP which has not been done to date
   #Sepsis:  Patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia,
   hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. Appears to have
   been urosepsis, has positive UCx here but all blood has been negative.
   Has had multiple previous UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley
   placement at OSH.  Was on just Ampicillin but now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to spiking fevers [**12-23**]. Continues
   currently on minimal pressure support and BP
s look good.
   - Will wean Levo today then d/c. If bp
s lower, go with IVF
s first, as
   his CVP is low, and BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, suggesting
   intravascularly down
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - f/u neuro recs: recommend broad infectious workup, including possible
   CT torso.
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with
   respiratory failure in the setting of severe acidosis with tachypnea
   and possible developing left sided infiltrate. Pt was switched between
   AC and CPAP, currently on AC to allow him to rest.
   - Trial of CPAP today with follow up ABG
   - Can allow a more lenient goal of CO2 50 given that he has h/o COPD.
   - Serial ABG
   - Consider RSBI and SBT tomorrow
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but this am is tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **].
   - Will restart Digoxin today at home dose
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need anticoagulation given appearance of multiple ischemic events
   on head CT and history of atrial fibrillation, but this can be started
   once he is more stable.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb had been rising; thought at first to be
   due to resuscitation with D5W with HCO3, but has now persisted. Other
   etiologies include loss of H+ from GI or kidneys, contraction alkalosis
   (less likely given 11L positive through LOS, however, he could be
   intravascularly deplete), posthypercapnia (although hasn
t really been
   hypercapneic since admission), volume depletion (possible), hyperaldo,
   and hypoK (neither of which there have been much evidence for).  Will
   continue to trend and if continues to be high, consider
   Acetazolamide.
   - trend ABG's
   - Check urine chloride this am
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: IVF for resuscitation and to maintain UOP's and MAP's as above,
   replete electrolytes, tube feeds with pulmonary nutren, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, already intubated. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

intubated and altered mental status
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He developed sepsis, which was initially treated with ampicillin but then broadened to include vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin due to spiking fevers. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker, and is now on minimal pressors. He is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support. His mental status has improved, but he still requires frequent reorientation. There are concerns about his electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, and possible coronary artery disease. The patient's blood sugar levels were initially very high but have been brought under control with insulin. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and his ABG results show a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and has a history of severe emphysema with respiratory failure. The respiratory support should continue to be monitored and adjusted as needed.

2. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have spiking fevers. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, and further evaluation and broadening of antibiotics may be necessary.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Start digoxin at 1/2 of his home dose
   - Trial of PS from AC, goal CO2 can be 50 since he is COPD'er
   - Down on the Levo and give IVF's for bp --> gave 1L NS --> UOP good
   and CVP's have increased [**3-30**] to [**7-8**] --> now off Levo
   - ABG in the afternoon 7.45/40/69/29  --> went up on PS from [**5-31**] to
   [**12-31**], continues 40%   --> later tonight, plan to go to [**10-31**] and test
   RSBI
   - Wanted to do SBT but was tachypneic, tachycardic.
   - Met alkalosis, so got urine chloride --> 119 (saline resistant and
   not hypertensive, so DDx = diuretics use, hypoK (not seen), Bartter's
   Gitelman's, exogenous alkali?

The patient presented with elevated WBC count, tachycardia, hypothermia, elevated lactate consistent with sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for developing left-sided infiltrate. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation status is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

2. Sepsis: The patient has positive urine cultures for GPCs and strep viridans, indicating a urinary tract infection. Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's fever has not subsided, suggesting a possible ongoing septic state. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially temperature, and frequent reassessment of laboratory parameters are essential to detect any worsening of sepsis.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are slightly abnormal, with low potassium levels and low magnesium. Frequent monitoring of electrolytes is necessary to avoid complications related to imbalances, such as cardiac arrhythmias.

4. Cardiac Dysrhythm"

   Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Start digoxin at 1/2 of his home dose
   - Trial of PS from AC, goal CO2 can be 50 since he is COPD'er
   - Down on the Levo and give IVF's for bp --> gave 1L NS --> UOP good
   and CVP's have increased [**3-30**] to [**7-8**] --> now off Levo
   - ABG in the afternoon 7.45/40/69/29  --> went up on PS from [**5-31**] to
   [**12-31**], continues 40%   --> later tonight, plan to go to [**10-31**] and test
   RSBI
   - Wanted to do SBT but was tachypneic, tachycardic.
   - Met alkalosis, so got urine chloride --> 119 (saline resistant and
   not hypertensive, so DDx = diuretics use, hypoK (not seen), Bartter's
   Gitelman's, exogenous alkali?
   - UOP good and 2L through today, but CVP still low [**3-30**] so given 500cc
   bolus of NS --> CVP's rose appropriately [**1-8**]

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well for a two-hour SBT and is ready
   for a trial of extubation.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan
   with respiratory failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and
   possible developing left sided infiltrate.
   - f/u ABG post-extubtation
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs should be transitioned to nebulizers.
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - reassess after extubation when patient can be more interactive.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 7-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: His bicarb is slightly improved today.  After
   extubation, he should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most
   likely he is chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing
   him to raise his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow consult
   after extubation, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: Possible call-out tomorrow if remains extubated
","The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. He developed a fever and required pressor support upon admission. His medical history includes coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), diarrhea, altered mental status (not delirium), urinary tract infection (UTI), hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker.

The patient's current condition is improving, with decreased reliance on pressors and improved vital signs. His respiratory status has stabilized, and he is ready for a trial of extubation. However, there are potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience a recurrence of respiratory failure if extubation fails or if he develops a new lung condition.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of continued infection and sepsis if the antibiotics are not effective against all pathogens.

3. UTI: The patient has a history of multiple UTIs and is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection. There is a risk of recurrence or progression of the UTI.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further imbalances.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR tomorrow morning
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 14 days for complicated UTI and VAP
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow consult
   today, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Continues to be intubated and on minimal pressors, but is waking up,
   following commands, and appears overall much improved.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well for a two-hour SBT and is ready
   for a trial of extubation.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan
   with respiratory failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and
   possible developing left sided infiltrate.
   - f/u ABG post-extubtation
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs should be transitioned to nebulizers.
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - reassess after extubation when patient can be more interactive.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 7-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Watch fever curve, consider broadening if continued spikes  -->
   Flagyl
   - Cx for spiking fevers
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: His bicarb is slightly improved today.  After
   extubation, he should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most
   likely he is chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing
   him to raise his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow consult
   after extubation, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with multiple comorbidities including COPD, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate levels. The patient developed sepsis and required pressor support. He also had positive cultures for Enterococcus and Streptococcus viridans in his urine.

The patient's current condition is improving, and he is awake and following commands. He has been extubated successfully after a two-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The plan is to transition his respiratory medications from metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) to nebulizers.

The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial and likely due to infection and medication toxicity. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck did not reveal any abnormalities.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with PVCs is being managed with a pacemaker, and he is currently paced and tachycardic. His digoxin level is normal, and he will continue on a home dose of digoxin.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is being monitored, and it is expected to improve after extubation. He may have pre-renal acute renal failure due to sepsis, with a possible component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and initial post-renal obstruction. A Foley"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR tomorrow morning
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 14 days for complicated UTI and VAP
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR tomorrow morning
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 14 days for complicated UTI and VAP
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow consult
   today, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He was started on ampicillin but developed a fever, so the antibiotic regimen was broadened to include vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient had a positive urine culture for enterococcus and streptococcus viridans.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is tolerating it well but requires suctioning of secretions. He has severe emphysema and is showing signs of possible developing left-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

The patient also had sepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which has improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He is currently off of pressors and is improving.

The patient has altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial due to infection and toxic/metabolic effects from medications. A CT angiogram of the head and neck did not reveal any abnormalities.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker, but his current rhythm is paced and tachycardic. He was on home digoxin, which we had not restarted due to a normal rate in the past. His digoxin level here was normal.

The patient has mild right upper extremity edema without pain, which will be ruled out for possible thrombus formation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and urosepsis. He was admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday. The patient still requires a significant amount of oxygen and is being treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 140/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 50%. His physical examination shows no acute distress, thin appearance, and right lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low sodium levels, and normal kidney function. The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, VAP, urosepsis, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antibiotic therapy for VAP and urosepsis. The patient's code status is DNR, and he will remain in the ICU for further care."

   ICU Care
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well, secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR daily
   - check afternoon ABG as follow-up to metabolic alkalosis previously
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly again after extubation
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and
   concern for VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro)
   - Continue ampicillin, today is day #[**8-9**] (for complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl; and/or restart vanc/cefepime
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus. Less asymmetric today.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus
 f/u final read
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, plan to remove CVL after PICC placed, morphine liquid
   elixir (failed speech & swallow), change position
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   - check afternoon ABG
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, IR-guided Dobhoff to be placed
   today per speech & swallow, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV. Plan to place PICC (on R, d/t
   pacer on L), then afterwards pull CVL.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.
   Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 10077**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10078**], Son [**Name (NI) 5371**], Daughter
   [**Name (NI) 412**] is very involved
   Disposition: Possible call-out tomorrow, after PICC and Dobhoff have
   been placed. Start rehab screening.

   ICU Care
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well, secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR tomorrow morning
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly after extubation.
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 14 days for complicated UTI and VAP
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP after [**Holiday **] to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - continue digoxin at home dose.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus
 f/u final read
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow consult
   today, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV.
   Code:  DNR, okay to re-intubate. Per daughter, NO chest compressions,
   nothing to make him suffer.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Enterococcus and Streptococcus viridans in his urine.

The patient's current status shows improvement in several areas. His respiratory status has stabilized after being extubated, although he still requires suctioning of secretions. His blood pressure is within normal limits, and his heart rate is controlled. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 96% with the use of a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose levels have normalized after being in the 500s upon admission. Renal function has improved with a decreasing creatinine level. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including low potassium and magnesium levels.

Imaging studies reveal bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, consistent with his history of severe emphysema. A CT scan of the head and neck did not reveal any abnormalities.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total of 14 days, titrating oxygen to maintain saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection and respiratory failure. He has been extubated and is showing improvement. The patient has a history of failed swallow study, indicating the need for a Dobhoff tube for nutrition. He has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/74 mmHg to 156/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. He is receiving multiple medications including morphine sulfate, as well as antibiotics for his UTI. The patient's blood products and fluid balance show positive intake and output over the past 24 hours. He is receiving respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and his ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and altered liver function tests. The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, electrolyte/fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The plan includes stopping vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin since cultures have been negative. The patient should complete 14 days of ampicillin for septic shock/UTI. Other management plans include improving MS, anticoagulation for AFib, and resolution of acute renal failure. Foley catheter should be continued, and a Dobhoff tube will be needed. The central line will be pulled and a PIC line will be placed. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well, secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR daily
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - DNR, DNI reconfirmed
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Discontinued vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and
   concern for VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro)
   - Continue ampicillin, today is day #[**9-9**] (for complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> restart vanc/cefepime, and/or add flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation
   - digoxin converted from home PO to IV regimen
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus
 ultrasound negative
   for clot. Edema less asymmetric today
 resolving.
   - monitor clinically
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, plan to remove CVL after PICC placed, morphine liquid
   elixir drops on tongue (failed speech & swallow), change position
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   - follow ABG
s as related to respiratory status
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been appropriately in the 100's. Issue resolved.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, will attempt to place Dobhoff
   today per speech & swallow, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV. Plan to place PICC today (on R,
   d/t pacer on L), then afterwards pull CVL.
   Code:  DNR, DNI. Per daughter, NO chest compressions, nothing to make
   him suffer. DNR, DNI.

   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well, secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR daily
   - check afternoon ABG as follow-up to metabolic alkalosis previously
   - titrate O2 to sat in low 90s.
   - discuss with daughter whether re-intubation is an option if he does
   poorly again after extubation
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and
   concern for VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro)
   - Continue ampicillin, today is day #[**8-9**] (for complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> Flagyl; and/or restart vanc/cefepime
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation.
   - digoxin converted from home PO to IV
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus. Less asymmetric today.
   - RUE US to r/o thrombus

   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, plan to remove CVL after PICC placed, morphine liquid
   elixir (failed speech & swallow), change position
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.
   - check afternoon ABG
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for

   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been in the 100's.
   - Keep eye on BS and either restart gtt if very elevated consistently
   or start SSI.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, IR-guided Dobhoff to be placed
   today per speech & swallow, oral nystatin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with severe COPD and respiratory failure. He requires frequent suctioning due to poor secretion clearance. The patient has been desaturating, indicating potential oxygenation issues. He has a history of allergies to specific antibiotics. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, atrovent/albuterol, famotidine, digoxin, and morphine. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he is on mechanical ventilation support. The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to poor secretion clearance and potential inadequate oxygenation.
2. Metabolic alkalosis from prior lasix use.
3. Cardiac dysrhythmia, possibly atrial fibrillation.
4. Sepsis with organ dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia.
6. Electrolyte & fluid disorder.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Altered mental status.
9. Potential complications related to the use of mechanical ventilation support.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine.
   Extubated yesterday, tolerating well, secretions needing to be
   suctioned.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.
   - CXR daily
   - titrate O2 to PO2 in low 90s.
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.   Discontinued
   vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and concern for
   VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro).  Currently on Ampicillin
   - Continue Ampicillin, today is day #[**1-9**] (initiated [**12-18**] for
   complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> restart vanc/cefepime, and/or add flagyl
   - IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation
   - Digoxin converted from home PO to IV regimen.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus
 ultrasound negative
   for clot. Edema less asymmetric today
 resolving.
   - monitor clinically
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, plan to remove CVL after PICC placed, morphine liquid
   elixir drops on tongue (failed speech & swallow), change position
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.  Currently not in metabolic alkalosis
   - follow ABG
s as related to respiratory status
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been appropriately in the 100's. Issue resolved.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes, tubefeeds per Dobhoff per
   speech & swallow, oral nystatin.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PO lansoprazole.
   Access: CVL, Arterial line, 20g PIV. Plan to place PICC today (on R,
   d/t pacer on L), then afterwards pull CVL.
   Code:  DNR, DNI. Per daughter, NO chest compressions, nothing to make
   him suffer. DNR, DNI.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema and was admitted with respiratory failure. Although the patient is tolerating well after extubation, there is still a requirement for suctioning secretions, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.

2. Sepsis: The patient appears to have had urosepsis, which was initially treated with ampicillin but then broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin due to spiking fevers and hypotension. The patient is currently off of pressors and improving, but antibiotics will be continued for a 14-day course. If the patient continues to improve, consideration may be given to returning to just ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of multiple previous UTIs, and the current infection involves enterococcus and strep viridans in the urine.

4. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing tachycardia with PVCs. The patient is paced and tachycardic, and digoxin levels are normal. It is recommended to contact the primary care physician to discuss possible anticoagulation.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely"

   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine. On
   pressors previously, now weaned off.  Now extubated, tolerating well.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.  CXR looks improved but with some
   pulmonary edema.
   - Weaning O2 down; now on face mask at 6L.  Continue titrating down O2
   as tolerated to PO2 in low 90s.
   - Lasix 20mg IV for goal -0.5-1L today, with prn Lasix as needed for
   SOB
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.   Discontinued
   vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and concern for
   VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro).  Currently on
   Ampicillin.
   - Continue Ampicillin, today is day #[**1-9**] (initiated [**12-18**] for
   complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> restart vanc/cefepime, and/or add flagyl
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - Convert Digoxin from IV to to home PO dose.
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation, given history of CVA
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, plan to remove CVL after PICC placed, morphine liquid
   elixir drops on tongue (failed speech & swallow), change position
   - Tylenol standing
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Mild right upper extremity edema
   without pain
 will rule out possible thrombus
 ultrasound negative
   for clot. Edema less asymmetric today
 resolving.
   - monitor clinically
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb slightly improved.  After extubation, he
   should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most likely he is
   chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing him to raise
   his bicarb.  Currently not in metabolic alkalosis
   - follow ABG
s as related to respiratory status
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival to the
   MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and his BS's
   have been appropriately in the 100's. Issue resolved.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He had a positive OSH Cx for GPCs and was started on ampicillin but developed a fever and broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro due to suspected enterococcus and strep viridans in urine. The patient is now extubated, tolerating well, and requires suctioning of secretions. He has severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory failure in the setting of acidosis and tachypnea. There is a possible developing left-sided infiltrate, and the CXR looks improved but with some pulmonary edema. The patient has been on a 14-day course of antibiotics and may consider returning to just ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures. He is currently afebrile and off of pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is still requiring supplemental oxygen. There is a possibility of developing left-sided infiltrate, indicating potential pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently improving, there is a risk of recurrent sepsis due to his history of multiple UTIs and positive UCx. Monitoring for any signs of fever or hypotension is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hematuria. The patient has been treated for sepsis, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe emphysema and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and daily chest X-rays will be necessary to assess the progression of the condition.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with urosepsis, which is a severe systemic infection that can lead to organ dysfunction. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient's response to treatment will be closely monitored.

3. UTI: The patient has a history of multiple UTIs, and the current infection is caused by enterococcus and streptococcus viridans. Antibiotic therapy will be continued for a 14-day course, with consideration of returning to ampicillin if the patient continues to improve and has negative cultures.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have returned to baseline. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe COPD, respiratory failure, and septic shock due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). He has persistent weakness and poor cough. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, pain medication, and cardiac medications. His vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/45 mmHg to 143/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device.

The patient's physical examination shows diminished breath sounds bilaterally, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive mental status. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and normal glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is currently being managed with diuretics to remove excess fluid. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the UTI. Continued administration of appropriate antibiotics and careful monitoring of vital signs and organ dysfunction are crucial to managing this condition.

3. Hyperglycemia: Although the patient's current glucose levels are within"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine. On
   pressors previously, now weaned off.  Now extubated, tolerating well.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.  CXR looks improved but with some
   pulmonary edema.
   - Weaning O2 down; now on humidified mask at 6L.  Continue titrating
   down O2 as tolerated to PO2 in low 90s.
   - Lasix prn for SOB, not giving any today
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.   Discontinued
   vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and concern for
   VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro).  Currently on
   Ampicillin.
   - Continue Ampicillin, today is day #13/14 (initiated [**12-18**] for
   complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> restart vanc/cefepime, and/or add flagyl
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - Digoxin (PO home med)
   - ASA 325mg as anticoagulation, as not on coumadin given fall risk
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, morphine liquid elixir drops on tongue (failed speech
   & swallow), change position
   - Tylenol standing
   # Leukocytosis
 unclear etiology, consider c.diff given multiple
   antibiotics recently
   - check c.diff if stools before discharge, but not currently having
   diarrhea
   - if develops diarrhea at rehab, consider c.diff testing and treatment
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Ultrasound negative for clot. Resolved.
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   - Write in d/c summary importance of contacting urology and NOT taking
   out foley
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Resolved. Bicarb slightly improved.  After
   extubation, he should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most
   likely he is chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing
   him to raise his bicarb.  Follow ABG
s if dictated by respiratory
   status.
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Resolved. Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival
   to the MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and
   his BS's have been appropriately in the 100's.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - change aspirin 81mg daily (home med) to 325mg daily given afib
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)
   FEN: no IVF today, replete electrolytes prn, tubefeeds by Dobhoff
   Nutren pulmonary, oral nystatin. NPO. Bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The patient was started on ampicillin but developed a fever and his condition worsened, leading to the broadening of antibiotics to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin due to positive cultures for enterococcus and streptococcus viridans in the urine. The patient is currently extubated and tolerating well on a face tent with high flow oxygen. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is at risk for developing left-sided infiltrates. There is improvement in the chest X-ray, but pulmonary edema is still present. The plan is to wean down the oxygen and continue with nebulizers.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis, and despite being off pressors, he is still on a 14-day course of antibiotics. If he continues to improve, there may be a consideration of returning to just ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.
3. Atrial fibrillation/PVCs: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently paced and tachycardic. Digoxin has been restarted,"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old gentleman admitted from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital with
   respiratory failure, hematuria and elevated lactate, who developed a
   pressor requirement upon admission, had OSH Cx
s positive for GPC
s and
   was started on Ampicillin but spiked higher temps and now broadened to
   Vanc/Cefipime/Cipro, with enterococcus and strep viridans in urine. On
   pressors previously, now weaned off.  Now extubated, tolerating well.
   #Respiratory Failure:  He has done well following extubation on a face
   tent with high flow oxygen, though still requiring suctioning of
   secretions.  Patient with severe emphysema on CT scan with respiratory
   failure in the setting of acidosis with tachypnea and possible
   developing left sided infiltrate.  CXR looks improved but with some
   pulmonary edema.
   - Weaning O2 down; now on humidified mask at 6L.  Continue titrating
   down O2 as tolerated to PO2 in low 90s.
   - Lasix 20mg IV for goal -0.5-1L today, with prn Lasix as needed for
   SOB
   - Continue Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   #Sepsis:  On presentation appears to have had urosepsis, w/ positive
   UCx though all blood has been negative.  Has had multiple previous
   UTI
s, and then with traumatic foley placement at OSH.  He was on just
   Ampicillin but was then broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, day 2 due to
   spiking fevers and hypotension [**12-23**].  He is now off of pressors and
   improved, but we will continue for a 14-day course of antibiotics.
   Though if he continues to improve, may consider returning to just
   ampicillin after 48 hours of negative cultures.   Discontinued
   vancomycin and cefepime (had been started for spike and concern for
   VAP, but now afebrile and no growth on micro).  Currently on
   Ampicillin.
   - Continue Ampicillin, today is day #13/14 (initiated [**12-18**] for
   complicated UTI)
   - Currently afebrile.  Watch fever curve, consider cx and broadening
   abxif spikes  --> restart vanc/cefepime, and/or add flagyl
   #Atrial fibrillation/PVCs:  Patient s/p pacemaker for unclear
   underlying rhythm although [**Hospital3 33**] notes history of atrial
   fibrillation. He has been between sinus tachycardia with PVC
   intermittent conduction block, and his current rhythm is paced and
   tachycardic. He was on home Digoxin which we had not restarted due to a
   normal rate in the past, but is intermittently tachy to the low 100
   Digoxin level here was normal.
   - Digoxin (PO home med)
   - contact PCP to discuss possible anticoagulation, given history of CVA
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Neck soreness
 appears MSK due to position, extubation, etc.
 warm compress, morphine liquid elixir drops on tongue (failed speech
   & swallow), change position
   - Tylenol standing
   Other less acute or stable issues:
   #Altered mental status: Patient is improving and is now interactive and
   following commands.  His altered mental status is likely multifactorial
   due to infection and toxic/metabolic from medications.  He is being
   kept off of sedation.  CTA of head and neck did not reveal
   abnormalities.
   - improved, monitor clinically
   # Right Upper Extremity Edema:  Ultrasound negative for clot. Resolved.
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine now in normal range. On admission,
   was likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis, may also have component
   of ATN and initially post-renal obstruction.  Foley catheter now
   successfully placed. Cr has been trending down nicely with IVF's and
   currently at baseline.
   - Trend Cr and UOP with IVF to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr if possible
   - Foley catheter now in place = do NOT take out, per Urology, as below
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Resolved. Bicarb slightly improved.  After
   extubation, he should be able to adjust his own acid-base status.  Most
   likely he is chronically hypoventilating and slightly acidotic, causing
   him to raise his bicarb.  Follow ABG
s if dictated by respiratory
   status.
   #Traumatic Foley Placement:  Patient transferred after concern that
   foley may be placed in scrotum.  Initial CT concerning for
   intraabdominal placement, now most likely instead bladder
   diverticulum.  Urology did cystoscopy and placed Foley. Their recs are
   to keep Foley in place, do not remove without asking urology first,
   keep secure to thigh with 2 catheter secures, f/u with Urology when
   acute illness over.
   #Elevated Blood Sugars:  Resolved. Blood sugars in the 500s on arrival
   to the MICU and started on insulin gtt. Gtt has now been stopped and
   his BS's have been appropriately in the 100's.
   #Coronary Artery Disease:  Details unclear.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily (home med)
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue lipitor 10mg daily (home med)

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hematuria, and elevated lactate. He required pressor support upon admission and was found to have an obstructive shock cardiac cause positive for GPCs and strep viridans in his urine. The patient was started on ampicillin but developed a fever and the antibiotic regimen was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin due to suspected enterococcus and strep viridans infection. He has since improved and is now extubated, tolerating well on a face tent with high flow oxygen.

The patient has a history of severe emphysema and developed left-sided infiltrate with pulmonary edema. He is being weaned off oxygen and receiving Lasix for fluid management. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he had a pacemaker placement. He is currently paced and tachycardic, and Digoxin has been restarted.

Other issues include neck soreness, which is likely musculoskeletal due to position and extubation. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, likely multifactorial due to infection and medication toxicity. His mental status has improved with interaction and following commands. A CT angiography of the head and neck did not reveal any abnormalities.

The patient had right upper extremity edema, which resolved with an ultrasound negative for clot. He also had acute"
