   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 .  As there is concern for aspiration, will increase
   patient's PEEP to 10.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Place A-Line
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI vs Sugery
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with abdominal distention, lower extremity edema, and dyspnea. She has a duodenal obstructing mass and was found to have aspiration and hypoxia.

2. The patient had an increased white blood cell count despite being on antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection or antibiotic failure.

3. She underwent an IR-guided drainage of the bilioma and cultures are growing coag-positive cocci, indicating a possible bacterial infection.

4. The patient's duodenal stricture caused gastric distention, which was managed by placing a stent in the duodenum.

5. The patient's cholangiocarcinoma is unresectable and she has received treatment with 5-FU and radiation. There is a concern for potential disease recurrence.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's high WBC count and positive cultures suggest a risk of infection. The ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriate to address this concern.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.

3. Duodenal Stricture Complications: The duodenal stricture may lead to ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 . Self-extubated this AM and reintubated. Appears to
   have LUL collapse. Will consider bronch today to focally suction.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Place A-Line
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - PS ventilation this AM may be able to extubate soon after bronch
   later this AM.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI vs Sugery
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.  Will ask
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2998**] to see her.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  She self extubated on [**4-10**]
   and then was reintubated.  She is s/p bronchoscopy and a small piece of
   food (likely meat) was suctioned from her LUL which corresponded to her

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, chronic biliary obstruction, and infected bilomas/ hepatic abscess. She presented with abdominal distention, lower extremity edema, and dyspnea. A duodenal obstructing mass was found on ERCP, which led to hypoxia and aspiration. The patient underwent reintubation and bronchoscopy, where a piece of food was removed from her left upper lobe.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxia, and aspiration contents were suctioned from her airway. She self-extubated but was reintubated and underwent bronchoscopy to remove a piece of food from her LUL. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn), and sputum culture is growing yeast with pseudohyphae and gram-positive cocci in pairs.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced a drop in blood pressure requiring the initiation of vasopressor support (Levophed) and fluid resuscitation. She also had an increasing white blood cell count.
3. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: The patient had an increase in the size of infected bilomas despite being on oral antibiotics (Augmentin, Levofloxacin, Fluconazole) at home. Her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   - Consider bronchoscopy
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI oncology
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma who presented with abdominal distention, leg edema, and dyspnea. She was found to have a duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP and underwent intubation after experiencing hypoxia and aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and aspiration event suggest a high risk of respiratory failure due to compromised oxygenation. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and FiO2 adjustment are necessary.

2. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: The patient has an increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC, and organisms concerning for infection/antibiotic failure/poor antibiotic absorption. Continuing IV antibiotics and sending for sputum culture are important.

3. Duodenal Stricture: The patient's gastric distention secondary to duodenal stricture may lead to further complications such as aspiration pneumonia or bowel ischemia. Placement of a stent in the duodenum and close monitoring of electrolytes are recommended.

4. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis and previous treatment with 5-FU and radiation indicate a high risk of disease recurrence. Regular follow-up with oncology providers is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   Moving in the direction of comfort only after meeting with family this
   AM
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
    - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID - will f/u recs
    - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 .  LUL collapse has resolved post bronch.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
    - Place A-Line
    - Send for Sputum for culture
    - PS ventilation this AM may be able to extubate soon after bronch
   later this AM.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process
    - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.  Will ask
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2998**] to see her.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with abdominal distention, lower extremity edema, and dyspnea. She was found to have a duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP, which complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event. The patient underwent IR-guided drainage of a biloma and was started on antibiotics due to the presence of an infected biloma. She is currently on IV fluc, zosyn, and vancomycin.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: The patient has an infected biloma that is not responding to oral antibiotics due to gastric outlet obstruction. She is currently receiving IV antibiotics.

2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced hypoxia and required intubation after ERCP. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Duodenal Stricture: The patient has a duodenal stricture causing gastric distention. A stent has been placed in the duodenum to alleviate the obstruction.

4. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a history of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and has undergone radiation therapy. There are concerns about potential disease recurrence.

5. FEN (Feeding): The patient is currently on NPO (nothing by mouth), receiving IV fluids"
