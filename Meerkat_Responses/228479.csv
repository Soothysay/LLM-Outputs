   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 F with DM, 2VCAD, CKD, and ischemic CMP (EF (20-25%)
   presenting with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days.
   Hyperglycemia corrected but now being admitted to CCU for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension - Most likely intravascularly depleted secondary to
   volume loss in the setting of several days of osmotic diuresis from
   hyperglycemia.  Pt without fever or WBC or other evidence of infection
   to indicate Sepsis.  No e/o hemorrhage. Possibly cardiogenic but no ST
   elevations to indicate MI or other inciting event. Pt currently SBP
   90-100 after 750mL of IVF.  Total body overloaded.  O2 sats good
   currently on 2L.  Baseline blood pressures are low 90-100.
   - recheck Hct, coags, send T&S.
   - urine & blood cx
   - will place central line & possibly swan ganz to eval pressures.
   - will obtain cxr
   - goal MAP>60, bolus PRN, will use pressors if needed.
   - hold lisinopril and metoprolol
   - recheck ECHO.
   .
   # Diabetes: pt admitted with hyperglycemia after no insulin for a few
   days. No anion gap this admission.  BS in low 100s currently.
   - glargine at home dose
   - sliding scale
   .
   # Hyponatremia: most likely hypovolemic at this point. improved from
   admission which was most likely even lower secondary to hyperglycemia.
   - will check urine lytes.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: [**12-20**] Ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Will
   carefully monitor volume status and I/Os.
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix & spironolactone for hypotension
   .
   # CAD: CAD is not intervenable. no angina or cp
   - continue aspirin 325 and statin.
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Cr at baseline of 1.4.  Continue to monitor
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # GERD with H. Pylori infection: continue ppi.
   - ppi now [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue clarithromycin 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and Amoxicillin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for 14
   days

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, 2-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was subsequently admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension.

The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to intravascular volume depletion secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. There is no evidence of infection or hemorrhage, but cardiogenic causes are possible. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and fluid boluses will be given as needed. Pressors may also be used if necessary.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient had elevated blood sugar levels after missing insulin doses. Insulin therapy will be continued with both a basal rate and a sliding scale.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be hypovolemic in nature. This could be related to the hyperglycemia that occurred earlier. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes will be done.

4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy, and careful monitoring of volume status and input/output (I/O) balance is"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   67 yr old woman with DM and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%.
   Reviewed cath films showing severe 3VD with PCW 43 and unsuccessful PCI
   of LAD and turned down for CABG for poor targets.
   Transferred to CCU with hypotension.
   Tried diuresis overnight with Milrinone, lasix and neo drips but
   resulted in minimal diuresis, sig tachycardia and hypotension.
   This AM PEA arrest resulting in CPR and intubation and multiple
   pressors.
   Physical Examination
   unresponsive.
   ++ JVD
   3+ edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Hopeless prognosis with severe ischemic CM now with unrelenting fluid
   overload and hypotension and no possibility for revascularization.
   IABP or Impella discussed but not felt to be indicated in view of poor
   prognosis and no possibility for revasc.
   Will discuss with family who has requested DNR status.
   Anticipate death in near future.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension. The patient had a previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) but declined further coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to poor targets.

The patient's condition has deteriorated, with a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intubation. She is currently on three pressors for hemodynamic support and is maintained on sedation with fentanyl and versed. The family has requested a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

The patient's medical decision making involves a hopeless prognosis with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, unrelenting fluid overload, hypotension, and no possibility for revascularization. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or Impella therapy has been discussed but is not indicated in this case due to the poor prognosis and lack of revascularization options.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening heart failure, further episodes of hypotension, development of renal failure, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep"

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 84/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's CVP is 19 mmHg, total fluid intake is 4438 mL, and total fluid output is 724 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 25, HCO3- of 134, BE of -2, and lactate of 3.6 mmol/L. Physical examination findings are not assessed. Lab results include a WBC count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, glucose of 139 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, and platelet count of 335 K/uL. The patient has a history of heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and is currently on ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest leading to prolonged hypoxia and potential brain injury.
2. Sepsis due to the profound anion gap metabolic acidosis and high lactate levels.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) indicated by the elevated creatinine level.
4. Respiratory complications from mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
6. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypotension and organ perfusion issues due to the need for multiple pressors.
8. Hyperglycemia due to the stress response and diabetes mellitus."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. She presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was admitted to the CCU for hypotension. She experienced a cardiac arrest this morning and required resuscitation with epinephrine and other pressors. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with high lactate. The patient has been weaned off most pressors except for levo. She is sedated with fentanyl and versed. The family has been informed about the patient's condition, and a DNR/DNI status has been established. The patient's goals of care will need to be discussed again with the family. There are no plans for escalation of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to invasive ventilation.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and invasive lines increase the risk of DVT.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, indicating ongoing hemodynamic compromise.
4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to decreased renal perfusion.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's end-stage heart failure may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, 2-vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20-25%). He presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was admitted to the critical care unit for hypotension. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest this morning and required resuscitation with advanced life support measures, including invasive ventilation. He also required pressors (dopamine, norepinephrine, levo, and vasopressin) for persistent hypotension and remained on ventilatory support. The patient's condition is complicated by profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with high lactate, which is being compensated by ventilator settings. The family meeting was held, and the patient has been declared do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). The goals of care were discussed with the family, and no further plans for escalation of care were made. The patient's minimal neurologic function, end-stage heart failure, and inability to bridge to other therapy were considered during the discussion. The patient's current plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60, weaning levo as tolerated, holding sedation and fentanyl, monitoring mental status, weaning vent as tolerated, repleting electrolytes, providing subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis, and utilizing a radial"

 Family discussion held and patient DNR/DNI. No
   further plans for escalation of care.  Pt with minimal neurologic
   function.  Pt pressors were weaned overnight to levo. Pt has end-stage
   heart failure. Balloon pump not an option as the patient cannot be
   bridged to other therapy. CAD is not intervenable.
   - maintain MAPS > 60 and wean levo as tolerated
   - hold sedation, fentanyl, versed and monitor mental status
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - family discussion regarding level of care and possible CMO. Pt son
   was coming overnight, but did not come. Will need to discuss with
   family regarding goals of care.
