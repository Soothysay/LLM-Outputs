","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and a recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma who is currently undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5FU and XRT). He presents with profuse bloody red blood per rectal passage (BRBPR) and lightheadedness. The patient has been treated for anemia with one unit of packed red blood cells (uPRBC) and is receiving intravenous fluids. He is also on antibiotics for a low-grade temperature.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.9째C (100.2째F), current temperature of 37.4째C (99.4째F), heart rate ranging from 80 to 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 74/63 mmHg to 109/63 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 15 to 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results indicate hemoglobin levels ranging from 33.8% to 36.2%, white blood cell count of 1.0 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose level of 127 mg/dL, sodium level of 24 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride level of 6 mg/dL, magnesium level of 108 mEq/L, calcium level of 138 mEq/L, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea have been attributed to possible necrosis of the bowel or tumor. Imaging studies are not expected to change the management plan. The patient's hct has stabilized around 33.8%. He has received one unit of uPRBC and is planned for further transfusion if necessary. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving maintenance fluids.

Assessment and Plan:

1. GI bleed: The patient's BRBPR is associated with diarrhea and abdominal cramping-type pain. It is likely related to necrosis of the bowel or tumor. Further imaging will not be helpful as it will not change the management. The patient's hct is stable, and he has received one unit of uPRBC. He will continue to be monitored and managed conservatively. If bleeding worsens, a plan for colectomy will be considered due to the patient being a surgical case.

2. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis management includes a daily regimen of [Doctor's First Name] 360mg, rifaximin 800mg, and cromolyn 400mg (when he eats). This regimen should be continued at home.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5FU and XRT) presents with profuse bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and lightheadedness.
- The patient is scheduled for a total colectomy, which will allow for further chemotherapy in the setting of severe ulcerative colitis.
- The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as confusion, delirium, psychosis, rash, and skin irritation.
- Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total intake and output, as well as urine output.
- Respiratory support is not required as the patient is breathing independently with oxygen saturation at 100%.
- Physical examination reveals well-appearing general appearance, chest clear to auscultation, rapid and regular heart rhythm, tender abdomen with diminished bowel sounds, and no extremity edema or calf tenderness.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's blood products and urine output have been monitored.
- Imaging studies have been performed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma who has been undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5FU and XRT). The patient presents with profuse BRBPR (blood and rectal blood pigment reaction) and lightheadedness. The vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-appearing general appearance, chest clear to auscultation, regular rapid heart rate with tachycardia, diminished bowel sounds with tenderness in the left and right lower quadrant, no extremity edema or calf tenderness. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine and lactate levels. The electrolytes are within normal limits.

Further imaging will not be helpful as it will not change management. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable overnight, and BRBPR has reduced.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. He presents with profuse bloody rectal output, lightheadedness, and moderate abdominal pain. The patient underwent a total colectomy, sparing the rectum and colon cancer for further neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He now has Hartmann's pouch and an ileostomy with ongoing output from both. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is not neutropenic. His HCT is stable, but he experiences moderate pain that is not well controlled. The plan is to advance his diet gradually and switch to long-acting pain control medication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing bloody output from the ostomy and rectal output, indicating a possible ongoing gastrointestinal bleed.
2. Ulcerative colitis: The patient is on medication for ulcerative colitis, but there is no mention of current symptoms or ongoing management.
3. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers, which could indicate an infection or a side effect of chemotherapy.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient does not show clinical evidence of DVT, it is important to monitor for this complication due to the patient's immobility and chemotherapy treatment.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, who is currently undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He presented with profuse bloody rectal bleeding and lightheadedness. The patient has undergone a total colectomy, sparing the rectum and colon cancer, with Hartmanns pouch and ileostomy creation. He is currently experiencing hypoactive bowel sounds, moderate pain that is not well controlled, and is advancing his diet gradually.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent colectomy with Hartmanns pouch and ileostomy creation puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring ostomy output and rectal output is crucial.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy, he is at an increased risk for infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, including temperature, and follow-up with blood cultures if fever recurs, is essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As a hospitalized patient with limited mobility, the patient is at risk for developing blood clots. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT should be performed.
4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's recent surgery and ongoing fluid losses through ostomy output may lead to imbalances in fluid and electrolytes. Regular monitoring of fluid balance and electroly"

","The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma who underwent a total colectomy. The patient's current condition includes fever, pain that is moderately controlled with morphine PCA, hypoactive bowel sounds, and stable HCT. The patient's ostomy output and rectal output are being monitored. 

The patient's medical history includes ulcerative colitis, for which he is on a regimen of mesalamine 360mg daily, rifaximin 800mg daily, and cromolyn 400mg daily (when he eats). The patient has also undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 5FU and XRT. 

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient had a GI bleed post-total colectomy. The ostomy output and rectal output will be monitored. Pain management will be continued with morphine PCA. The patient is advancing his diet with ice chips and may sip liquids later today.
2. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's UC is being managed with mesalamine, rifaximin, and cromolyn. Rifaximin has been discontinued.
3. Fever: The patient has high fever without leukocytosis. He is not neutropenic but has"

","The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, who presented with profuse bloody bowel movement per rectum (BRBPR) and lightheadedness. The patient underwent total colectomy sparing the rectum and colon cancer for further neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The plan is to advance the diet gradually, start chemotherapy, and monitor ostomy output and rectal output.

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Fluid balance indicates an input of 5,006 mL and output of 2,335 mL over the last 24 hours. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving multiple IV medications including fentanyl, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole. He is also on a regimen of mesalamine, rifaximin, and cromolyn for ulcerative colitis. The patient has been prescribed ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for fever, but rifaximin has been discontinued.

The patient's assessment includes possible gastrointestinal bleeding due to recent surgery, ongoing fever without leukocytosis, and potential fluid/electrolyte imbalances. The plan includes monitoring ostomy output, rectal output,"

","The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and a recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. He presents with profuse bloody brown rectal output and lightheadedness. The plan is for colectomy but leaving the tumor intact, as colectomy will allow for chemotherapy in the setting of severe ulcerative colitis.

The patient has undergone a total colectomy sparing the rectum and colon cancer, with Hartmann's pouch and ileostomy creation. He is currently experiencing moderate pain that is not well controlled. The surgery team is considering switching to dilaudid or morphine PCA for more long-acting pain control. The patient is advancing his diet with ice chips in the morning and possible sips later today. His HCT levels are stable, and he is not neutropenic. The surgery team has called the stoma nurse, [First Name (Titles)] [Last Name (Titles) 2970], to follow up with the patient.

The patient is on a regimen of [Doctor First Name] 360mg daily for ulcerative colitis, along with rifaximin 800mg daily and cromolyn 400mg daily (when he eats). Rifaximin has been discontinued. The patient will be followed up by GI and Oncology with the provided follow-up recommendations.

The patient has a fever but no clinical evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Although he does"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and a recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, who presented with profuse bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and lightheadedness. The patient underwent total colectomy, sparing the tumor, and had Hartmann's pouch and ileostomy creation. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and recent surgery (colectomy), which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of ostomy output and rectal output is essential.
2. Ulcerative colitis: Although the patient has undergone colectomy, it is important to manage his ulcerative colitis symptoms with medication. However, rifaximin has been discontinued.
3. Fever: The patient has been experiencing high fever without leukocytosis. It is crucial to investigate potential sources of infection, including possible colitis in the remaining rectum, and continue to follow the patient's ANC (absolute neutrophil count).
4. GI/FEN: The patient's electrolytes should be repleted as needed, and he is currently on maintenance fluids. Protonix is being administered IV daily, and efforts are being made to improve his urine output.
5. PPX: Pneumoboots should be provided while the patient is in bed to prevent pressure ulcers.
